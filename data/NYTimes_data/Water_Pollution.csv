"Under fire for a Bush administration seen as hostile to the environment, Christie Whitman, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, issued a plea for patience today, saying critics had been too quick to denounce early decisions. On global warming and arsenic in drinking water, the two areas in which reversals by the White House have attracted the most criticism, Mrs. Whitman said the administration was working hard to develop better, more balanced policies than those that had been set aside. But in her first address to a major environmental organization, Mrs. Whitman met with considerable skepticism. After she left the podium, the head of the National Wildlife Federation, which has a bipartisan, middle-of-the-road reputation, appealed to her ''to call a truce in what is beginning to look like a war on the environment.'' ''We can't stand idly by and watch what is beginning to look like a cascade of efforts to roll back progress on the environment,'' said Mark Van Putten, the president of the wildlife federation, which had not joined other environmental groups in their criticism of the administration. The tense exchange at a hotel here came as the administration was facing sharper criticism from other environmental groups, one of which has already called for Mrs. Whitman's resignation, and from Congressional Democrats who have urged the White House to reconsider many of its early environmental actions. The environmental group that has called for Mrs. Whitman's resignation is Friends of the Earth, which endorsed former Vice President Al Gore last fall. The organization said Mrs. Whitman's defense of the administration positions cost her any credibility as a moderate. Mrs. Whitman, the former New Jersey governor, had advised the White House against its decision to come out against the Kyoto treaty on global warming. But in her address today, and in comments to reporters afterward, she assumed the role of a committed loyalist, saying she ''obviously'' did not agree with Mr. Van Putten's characterization and offering the most extensive defense to date of the administration's environmental policy making. Mrs. Whitman told reporters that critics had been exaggerating the impact of ''one or two decisions that people might disagree with'' while minimizing others generally seen as more favorable to the environment. One of those decisions left in place a Clinton administration rule forcing drastic reductions in emissions of pollutants by buses and big trucks, even though that action had been opposed by the oil industry. On arsenic, on which the Bush administration abandoned a strict drinking-water standard approved by the Clinton administration, Mrs. Whitman said for the first time that ''there's a very good likelihood'' that a review now under way might result in a recommendation of an even tougher standard. On global warming, Mrs. Whitman elaborated on earlier defenses of the administration's decisions to set aside the Kyoto treaty and to reverse a campaign promise to regulate power plants' emissions of carbon dioxide. Both actions have been criticized within the United States and abroad. Mrs. Whitman said President Bush ''wants to be proactive on the issue; he wants to move forward.'' ''But I think you'll agree,'' she said, ''that we are better off moving forward than fighting battles we may have already lost.'' Mrs. Whitman's comment was an allusion to the strong sentiment against the Kyoto accord that the Senate expressed in 1997, even before the treaty was signed. In place of the treaty's approach, which would have required the United States and other industrialized countries to meet strict standards for reductions of emissions of heat-trapping gases, Mrs. Whitman said the administration was seeking to develop an alternative that would emphasize ''technology, market-based incentives and other innovative approaches.'' Outside the room where Mrs. Whitman spoke, the National Wildlife Federation had posted signs calling the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska ''too wild to drill,'' a rallying cry in opposition to another administration policy. Mrs. Whitman did not explicitly defend the administration's effort to win Congressional approval for oil drilling in the refuge. But she did express frustration at the difficulty the administration faced in coming up with new supplies of energy. ''Nobody wants to drill for oil because of what that might do to the environment,'' Mrs. Whitman told reporters. ''No one wants oil transmission pipelines because they blow up. No one want to talk about nuclear energy. And even windmills kill birds because they're in the flyway.'' The administration is facing deadlines that could force decisions on other environmental issues. By April 17, it must decide whether to leave in place a Clinton administration rule that would sharply lower the threshold for companies that must make public details about their emissions of lead, which can cause severe health problems. Other policies under review include a reassessment of regulations on dioxin and a plan, approved but not put into effect by the Clinton administration, to regulate emissions of mercury from power plants."
"Substances with chemical structures similar to table salt -- but which look and flow like water -- may one day become environmentally friendly replacements for some of the noxious solvents used by industry. The so-called ionic liquids -- essentially salts with low melting temperatures -- were first invented in the 1940's but remained mainly novelties. ''They look terribly ordinary,'' said Dr. Kenneth R. Seddon, a professor of chemistry at Queen's College in Belfast, Northern Ireland. ''They look like water.'' Only in the past few years have chemists started thinking of them as a medium for performing chemical reactions. Although still years away from widespread industrial use, ionic liquids are attracting the interest of Exxon Mobil, BP Amoco and other companies. ''It's just a new way of thinking about them,'' said Dr. Robin D. Rogers, director of the Center for Green Manufacturing at the University of Alabama. More than 200 scientists crowded into 80 talks about ionic fluids at the American Chemical Society meeting in San Diego this month. ''It is a very exciting and promising young field,'' said Dr. Robert Morland, a senior scientist at BP Amoco Chemicals. ''It's just beginning to emerge.'' The most evident advantage of ionic liquids is environmental. Chemical reactions producing materials ranging from polyester to pharmaceuticals generally employ organic solvents -- a commonplace example of one is paint thinner -- but their fumes are often dangerous if inhaled and can contribute to the formation of smog. Most ionic liquids emit hardly any fumes, and they can usually be easily recycled and reused, eliminating many of the problems and costs of disposing of solvents. ''If, in fact, that turns out to be true, it may create an economic advantage,'' Dr. Morland said. The resemblance of ionic liquids to table salt is in their chemical bonds. Sodium chloride, the chemical name of table salt, consists of equal parts of sodium and chloride. Because of how the laws of quantum mechanics place electrons around a nucleus of an atom, a sodium atom has a loose hold on its outermost electron. (Think of the electrons filling seats in an auditorium. A sodium atom has, in essence, a single atom sitting alone in the upper balcony.) By contrast, the top level of electrons in a chlorine atom is full save for one spot (just one empty seat in the balcony). A chlorine atom will readily yank the loose electron away from a nearby sodium atom. That electron shift leaves the sodium positively charged and the chlorine negatively charged, and the two are pulled together like socks with static cling. The sodium and chlorine pairs then neatly stack up into a crystal of salt. Heated, the atoms in salt crystal start vibrating. Heated to 1,474 degrees Fahrenheit, the vibrations become so strong that the salt crystal melts into a liquid. Hot molten sodium chloride is of little use, but in an ionic liquid, a molecule with a similar loose electron takes the place of sodium and a second molecule is inserted for electron-grabbing chlorine. Because the molecules are larger than sodium and chlorine atoms, they do not stack as neatly. The molecules are not held together as tightly, and the compound melts at much lower temperatures. Some ionic liquids are still liquids at temperatures as cold as -130 degrees Fahrenheit. Because the liquid is made of ions rather than molecules, the chemical properties are different from those of conventional organic solvents. ''It's not surprising everything we see is brand new chemistry,'' Dr. Seddon said. By switching the molecules used in the ionic liquids, chemists will be able to design custom properties in their solvents. Dr. Seddon estimates one trillion possible combinations. ''You've got this incredible flexibility for getting the system right,'' he said. Ionic liquids can be mixed together to tweak their properties further. Dr. James Davis, a professor of chemistry at the University of South Alabama, gives the example of designing an ionic liquid that is able to bind with heavy metal pollutants like mercury and cadmium. Shaking contaminated water with the ionic liquid will enable the ionic liquid molecules to pull the heavy metals out of the water. The ionic liquid and water will then separate, and the clean water can be poured off. ''The salt and water don't mix,'' Dr. Davis said, ''just like if you have oil and vinegar in a salad dressing.'' In addition to the environmental advantage, ionic liquids are often better than traditional solvents and can enable some new chemical reactions. Ionic liquids are likely first to find applications in high-cost products like pharmaceuticals, with large-scale industrial applications following years later. But chemists still lack fundamental understanding of how ionic liquids work, even simple properties like the melting temperature. That makes for years of fertile research to come. ''It's just something so unexpected to have a salt that's a liquid,'' Dr. Davis said. ''That looks like an orchard I'm never going to finish picking fruit from.''"
"THIS article is not for people who have found the perfect house in the country. It's for those who have had to settle for the ranchburger on the quarter-acre lot surrounded by other ranchburgers -- people who inherited a front yard with a weeping something plunked onto a neatly clipped lawn, an overgrown blue spruce covering the picture window, forsythia pruned into a hedge. There is usually a gumdrop-shaped boxwood on either side of the door, as if to say, ''Be it ever so humble, this is Versailles to us.'' Homeowners not only fall victim to the offerings at the local nursery but also have a preconceived notion of where things should go. ''People usually say, 'I'm going to have the patio here, the lawn there and a screen of trees over there,' '' said Margie Ruddick, a landscape architect working in Philadelphia. ''But there's usually a drainage problem with the lawn, and a dry place where they want the screening. So they're out there watering the trees all the time.'' Instead, she urges homeowners to study how water moves through a property and think about planting native trees and shrubs, ones that grew before the developers came. In the plans here, Ms. Ruddick and Carol Franklin, another landscape architect based in Philadelphia, transform two modest homes with ecologically sensitive plantings. Ms. Ruddick's design focuses on the flow of water; Ms. Franklin's on the use of native plants. Both techniques reconnect the sites to what once existed beneath the hardtop. HOUSE 1: Fairfield, Conn. -- When a young couple with a baby moved from Manhattan to a little frame house on a busy street, Margie Ruddick & Associates set out to reconnect the site to its watershed. The house was dwarfed by two massive hollies that blocked the view from the picture window and hogged a third of the front lawn. And the house had no screening where it was needed, along the busy street. There were wet spots in both front and back, because of runoff from the road, which is slightly higher than the yard. The driveway and the roof also contribute to the wet spots. ''Builders will site the house to avoid drainage problems, but they often will not figure where the water is going,'' said Ms. Ruddick, who teaches design classes on such problems at the University of Pennsylvania. Owners can respond by grading and planting water-loving plants in low spots. ''People are determined to have grass even if their yard is shady and drains poorly,'' Ms. Ruddick said. But in this redesign, that sickly sod has been replaced by a vegetable garden and a woodland, both strategically situated in the wet areas. Strips of porous material called pumice wicks are placed across wet areas, to hold the water and release it slowly into the vegetable garden. Vegetables that need the most water are closest to a wick; those that like it hot and dry are planted farther out. The asphalt driveway has been replaced with porous pavement, which lets rain and snow replenish the groundwater. Such a driveway can be as simple as concrete blocks in grass, or a commercial product called Grasscrete. A porous strip right by the entrance to the house is planted with ground covers like periwinkle, sweet woodruff or bugleweed and low shrubs like dwarf fragrant sumac or spicebush. A little woods made of water-loving species like aspens, alders and birches serves as a screen from the heavily trafficked road. A shady moist area in the back corner of the lot is perfect for a wild zone of woody shrubs like viburnums, oak-leaf hydrangeas, Carolina allspice, winterberry, inkberry or serviceberry, with wet-loving perennials like Siberian iris, ligularia, lobelia or Joe-Pye weed. Ms. Ruddick is using the same strategies for the 65-acre Pashan Lake in Pune, in Maharashtra, India. The bare slopes of the lake will be terraced with gabions, or rocks encased in metal mesh, to slow down polluted water and let it percolate into the ground, nourishing palms, bamboo and other plants that like their feet wet. Constructed wetlands will filter the wastewater that once flowed unchecked from the city of Pune. ''It's good for people to realize these principles operate on a very different scale,'' Ms. Ruddick said. Replacing asphalt with a porous driveway is a spiritual link to the new wetland flowing into Pashan Lake. HOUSE 2: Philadelphia -- This little 1960's ranch house, on its half-acre lot with its bare patch of grass, faces a cul-de-sac of similarly routine landscapes. A chain-link fence borders the east side of the yard, where the neighbors cut down three magnificent oaks and painted the stumps silver. To the west, however, lies the Wissahickon Woods, a steep forested gorge that is actually in the Piedmont, or foothills, of the Appalachians. With her practiced eye, the landscape architect Carol Franklin knows what once grew there: a rich mixture of oak, tulip poplar, tupelo and other trees with a flowering understory of dogwood, shadbush and spicebush. The topsoil was as much as a foot deep. But 200 years ago, farmers chopped down the forest. When the land was developed for housing in the 1960's, the remaining topsoil was scraped bare. ''Developers typically sell it to contractors who will respread about four to six inches of it to grow grass,'' Ms. Franklin said. ''But what lies underneath is highly compacted from heavy machines.'' That explains why grass has had trouble growing around the little house, though a sassafras grove established itself in a remnant of a hedgerow and a black cherry has grown up in the backyard. The property was presented as a design class by Ms. Franklin at Penn for three hypothetical clients. Her first plan was for an elderly couple who might need a peaceful, low-maintenance landscape (in her work that means almost no lawn). She also did a design for an active family with four young children and two large dogs. In that case, the family would need a large lawn, for touch football, as well as a deck for entertaining and a vegetable garden. The third couple she imagined were hippies at heart, with a yen to produce their own food, wine grapes, natural dyes for weaving and medicinal herbs. This would be a homesteader client who would want a habitat, not a lawn. Ms. Franklin, who lectures on suburban landscapes, cites a few she will not abide. ''The first is America's red, white and blue landscape,'' she said, and then corrected herself. ''Actually, it's red, yellow and blue: Japanese maple; forsythia, sometimes clipped to a hedge; and Colorado blue spruce.'' A close runner-up is what she calls the Renaissance-comes-to-West Trenton look: a modest bungalow with a straight path to the front door, flanked by two neatly clipped yew balls. ''Not only is the scale wrong, but the whole thing is trivialized, because it's taken out of context,'' she said. Ms. Franklin, a co-founder of Andropogon Associates, a Philadelphia-based firm specializing in ecological design, studied with Ian L. McHarg, the author of the radical ''Design With Nature'' (John Wiley & Sons, 1995), when he headed the revitalized department of landscape architecture and regional planning at Penn in the 1960's. Here by the Wissahickon, she had plenty of native plants to use. ''If you cut down a forest for crops or pastureland, it will begin to reassert itself, first with cedars and then sassafras,'' she said. So that's what she chose to work with instead of the usual Japanese maples and double azaleas. ''One of the saddest things in our landscapes is a kind of ornamental horticulture blitzkrieg, with flowers as big as your head in the brightest colors,'' she said. In the plan she devised for the elderly couple, she envisioned a meadow of Andropogon (yes, the same as the name of her practice), or little bluestem grass, dotted with red cedars used as if they were columns in a room. ''One can see around and in between,'' she said. She proposed thinning the existing sassafras grove to a few large trees with trunks as distorted as sculptures. And she added more black cherry trees to the old one behind the house. She put flowering dogwoods, witch hazel and American fringe trees along the chain link fence on the east side of the lot. For the homesteading couple, she layered the yard with clumps of trees and a meadowful of little bluestem and purpletop, and prairie flowers like coneflowers, oxeye daisies, asters and goldenrod. ''Use plugs, not seed,'' Ms. Franklin advised, referring to the nursery-grown plants that are easier to establish. Such meadows must be cut or burned each year to encourage new growth and to kill woody seedlings. Ms. Franklin prefers burning, because the weight of a mower can break up grass and wildflower clumps. Or use a scythe or weed whacker. A curving border of lawn was designed along the street, to offer a bit of formality to the neighbors and to indicate that the native landscape beyond was intentional. The homesteaders were also given an orchard and a vegetable garden, with French-intensive raised beds and trellises full of grapes. For the active family, which needed the use of a lawn, she suggested groves of multistemmed black locusts to add shade to the backyard. ''The multistemmed trunks are not only beautiful but play with light and shadow,'' she said. ''A single stem can look like a parking meter for 20 years.'' Returning the context to the suburban lot shows the same respect for natural systems that underlies Ms. Franklin's work on far grander sites, such as restoring the woods around Fallingwater, which have been trodden by tourists. In Japan she is working with Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates to save an oak chestnut forest at a resort that will have footbridges across forested ravines, and controlled storm-water runoff. A good landscape architect can explode the tired little landscape that often is part of a good deal on a house. Be it a meadow or a simple screening of white birch in that wet spot, mini-ecosystems can turn a cookie-cutter lot into a personal refuge. And maybe even bring the denizens back to nature. HUMAN NATURE"
"Tumbling over boulders and winding through the red rock canyons and grassy meadows of western Montana, the Clark Fork appears to be a classic Western river. But the Clark Fork has a checkered past. Its beauty hides the fact that along most of its 120 miles in Montana it is contaminated with more than a century's worth of cadmium, arsenic, copper and other toxic mine waste that has washed down from the hard rock mining that began in 1864 at Butte. The last stop for the mine waste since 1907 has been here, behind the Milltown Dam, creating a huge pile of toxic sludge, six miles upstream from Missoula, a college town known as the Garden City. In the next few months, the Environmental Protection Agency will decide the fate of this river full of heavy metals. ''I can't see how anyone would think you could just leave 6.5 million cubic yards of toxic waste,'' said Tracy Stone-Manning, executive director of the Clark Fork Coalition, an environmental group. ''The only solution is to get it out.'' But for ARCO, the oil company that bought Anaconda Copper Mining in 1977, only to find that it had inherited an expensive mess that is one of the largest Superfund sites in the nation, the only economical solution is to let sleeping dogs lie. ''People in favor of removal grossly underestimate the problem of removal,'' said Sandy Stash, a vice president at ARCO, now part of British Petroleum, and the head of the cleanup. ''You will do more harm than good.'' The removal of sediment, by ARCO estimates, would cost at least $100 million, take 12 years and disrupt the river for that long. Large-scale underground mining in Butte ended in the 1950's, when Anaconda took the lid off the ''richest hill on Earth,'' and created a milewide open pit. ARCO closed operations there in the early 1980's. But the bills for the mess the miners made, much to the dismay of ARCO, are still rolling in. The cost for the cleanup to date is $700 million and is expected to reach $1 billion by the time company leaves, sometime in the next decade. Ms. Stash said profits from the property were negligible for the few years it remained operating. Many local residents portray the dam as a toxic time bomb. In February 1996, an ice jam 10 miles long and 14 feet thick built up steam and headed down river, a huge frozen missile that many feared would take out part of the dam and unleash the waste. Instead, the Montana Power Company, which owns the dam, drew down the water level and stranded the ice above the dam. But the water that the power company released churned up four feet of heavy metals that had been at the bottom of the reservoir and flushed it into the river. The result, county officials say, was a huge fish kill. Though the state limit for copper is 18 parts per billion, tests showed copper levels of 400 parts per billion. The following spring, a count by state fisheries of young rainbow and brown trout showed a decline of 86 percent and a decrease of two-thirds in the number of larger rainbow trout. ARCO officials are skeptical about what Ms. Stash called ''the alleged fish kill'' because no dead fish were seen. There are other problems with the 19th-century timber crib dam. Earthquakes are a possibility. Inspectors have found water leaking through cracks. And then there is the arsenic. High levels of the metal from the reservoir behind the dam leaked into groundwater and contaminated the wells of several dozen residents. ARCO drilled a deep new well to create safe water, but there are fears that the arsenic problem will return. Ms. Stash says that a large rubber dam attached to the present structure will ward off problems from ice jams. And the power company says that the cracks are nothing to worry about, comparing them with cracks in a sidewalk. Now there is a growing sentiment in Missoula, all along the political spectrum, not only to remove the sediments but to take out the dam as well, a project that ARCO says could cost up to $300 million. The E.P.A. estimates the cost of removal of the sediment at $120 million, the cost of the removal of both dam and sediment at $130 million and the cost of leaving the material and retrofitting the dam at $20 million. A proposal by Missoula County, called Two Rivers, would also remove another dam on the nearby Blackfoot River and allow the rivers to reconnect after a century apart, which would create a stretch of white water where the Milltown Dam now stands. ''The possibilities are outstanding if we can pull this thing off,'' said Peter Nielsen, an author of the proposal."
"The Brookfield landfill's 272 acres are dwarfed by the nearby Fresh Kills landfill's 3,000, but they still have a toxic punch. Those 272 acres leak 95,000 gallons of contaminated water every day into the groundwater and Richmond Creek. That water is tainted with pesticides, chlorinated solvents, lead and cadmium dumped at the landfill illegally from 1974 to 1980, the year it closed. The waste makes the landfill almost as much of a threat to the environment as Fresh Kills, which closed to much fanfare in March. Now the State Department of Environmental Conservation has come up with a $86.7 million plan to clean up the Brookfield landfill. First, it would be capped with a plastic liner covered with dirt. Then trenches and plastic barriers would funnel the tainted water into a treatment plant. Finally, the sites's gases would be burned off. Ted Mrozinski, a retired environmental engineer who lives near the landfill, said he thought the plan did not go far enough. He said the department should dig up the hazardous waste and remove it. ''Those heavy metals are going to migrate into the water,'' he said, ''unless they're taken out.'' But Helen Bialer, chairwoman of the Brookfield Landfill Citizens' Advisory Committee, a monitoring group, called such an effort unnecessary and expensive. Financing for the cleanup is in doubt. Jennifer Post, spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Conservation, said the city had collected $60 million from companies that illegally dumped at five city landfills. Of that amount, $12 million would go to Brookfield. Normally, the rest of the money would come from the state's Superfund account. But Ms. Post said Gov. George E. Pataki and the State Assembly are wrangling over how to run the Superfund, and its money has run out. Still, Ms. Post said the department would continue work under the assumption that the state would reimburse it. Should all go well, construction would begin in 2003. Eventually, the site will be covered with groves of trees and walking trails. JIM O'GRADY NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: GREENRIDGE"
"For a country with $7 billion of software exports and a huge talent pool of technical workers, India has been a spectacular underperformer in inventing and creating technology that addresses domestic needs. That may explain why the government has approved the $1.09 billion Media Lab Asia project, a collaboration of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and India's information technology ministry. The goal is to create technologies to benefit India's masses. ''It is just not enough for India to show a 45 percent annual growth in software exports,'' said Pramod Mahajan, India's information technology minister. ''We have to now harness our technical skill base to develop ideas to benefit India's billion-plus population.'' Once ready, the Indian version of the M.I.T. Media Lab, a technology incubator in Cambridge, Mass., is expected to be larger than the original. The expansion into Asia follows the opening of another Media Lab last year in Dublin. Media Lab Asia will promote a decentralized, project-based approach to research, said Walter Bender, executive director of the M.I.T. Media Lab. ''Projects will be designed to change people's lives using innovative and enabling technologies that can touch all of India,'' Mr. Bender said. India, with a population of one billion, a dozen official languages and hundreds of regional dialects, has a yawning digital divide. There are fewer than five computers for every 1,000 people. The lab, to be based outside Bombay with a string of regional laboratories, will receive a fifth of its financing from the Indian government. The rest is expected to come from corporate sponsors contacted by the government and the M.I.T. Media Lab. Media Lab Asia will emphasize products that deliver the benefits of information, communication and technology to India's rural dwellers, Mr. Mahajan said. Some of the projects under consideration include new sensors and wireless technologies in disaster control to help locate people and assist relief efforts, as well as to detect contaminated water and avoid illness; small, low-cost health appliances to perform simple diagnostics and gather epidemiological information; digital financial products, services and new forms of e-commerce to help entrepreneurs in the countryside and on farms; and technologies to provide communication to 300,000 Indian villages that have no telephones, and to offer new forms of entertainment."
"Six years ago, it seemed Meadowmere's troubles might be over. A tiny enclave on Jamaica Bay, at the edge of Rosedale and east of Kennedy Airport, Meadowmere is home to about 60 people. But until 1995, the city did not have formal title to its streets. Though residents paid city property taxes, they received no municipal services. Their streets were full of potholes. The two dozen houses were not connected to the city's sewer system; septic tanks emptied waste into the bay. Flooding was frequent, and trash pickup erratic. In 1995, Claire Shulman, Queens borough president, led an effort for the city to take title to Meadowmere's streets. But little changed. The Department of Environmental Protection has installed seepage basins to collect water, but because the groundwater is so high, they fill up in minutes during a storm. The agency plans to build a $12 million wastewater pumping station, but construction will not begin before 2005. ''At least the garbage pickup has improved,'' said Larry Shapiro, a resident. The problem is that Meadowmere has few political allies. Juanita Watkins, the local councilwoman, said that members of her staff had visited the neighborhood, but that no money was allocated to improve it. Though Pauline Rhodd-Cummings has represented the area in the State Assembly for two years, her spokeswoman, Vicky Pike, said the assemblywoman did not know where the neighborhood was. Dan Andrews, a spokesman for Ms. Shulman, said the city planned a study of future capital projects in Meadowmere. ''At some point down the line, hopefully all the projects will be funded,'' he said. ''But it is not going to happen overnight.'' James English, chairman of the Rosedale Civic Association, said, ''The politicians don't want to spend the money.'' Meadowmere has no community organization of its own. Mr. English said that the neighborhood was at risk of being subsumed by expansions at Kennedy Airport. Neighbors say they are considering forming their own civic association. Some are protesting by withholding property taxes. ''Let them call me delinquent,'' said David Soto, who has not paid property taxes for more than a year. ''What should we call them when it comes to public services? Incompetent? Maybe negligent?'' DANIEL HENDRICK NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MEADOWMERE"
"New York City has agreed to pay a $50,000 fine for violations of federal environmental laws because of contaminants found in and around equipment near the Rondout Reservoir in upstate New York, officials said yesterday. The city operates the reservoir in Sullivan County as part of its drinking water supply, and officials said the violations did not threaten the water quality. The violations involved mercury and PCB's, or polychlorinated biphenyls, discovered during an investigation begun three years ago by the United States attorney's office. ''New York City's drinking water continues to be safe,'' said Joel A. Miele Sr., city commissioner of environmental protection. ''The resolution of this matter is good for the agency and good for the city.'' City officials said that the Department of Environmental Protection admitted to one felony violation of the Clean Water Act for ''negligible'' amounts of mercury discovered in a sump, which collects groundwater. The department also admitted to one misdemeanor violation of the Toxic Substances Control Act for PCB's found to have leaked from a sluice gate operator, equipment that controls the flow of water throughout the system. As part of the agreement, which must be approved by the United States District Court, the city will accept some oversight of the water supply by an outside monitor for three to five years, officials said. Charles G. Sturcken, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection, said that since the 1980's the city has been replacing older equipment, some dating back to the 1940's, and cleaning up the buildings that house it."
"More than half of the nation's streams and wetlands could be removed from the protections of the federal Clean Water Act if two legal challenges started more than a decade ago by two Michigan developers are supported by a majority of the newly remade Supreme Court. One case involves a developer who wanted to sell a wetland for a shopping center and in preparation filled it with sand without applying for a permit, in defiance of the authorities. The second was brought by a would-be condominium developer who applied to the Army Corps of Engineers for a permit to fill a wetland and was denied. Oral arguments in the cases -- the first before the newest justice, Samuel A. Alito Jr. -- are scheduled for Tuesday morning. They will pit developers and a phalanx of their industrial, agricultural and ideological allies against both the solicitor general and a who's who of environmental lawyers in an argument over the scope of one of the country's fundamental environmental laws. The central question is where federal authority ends along the network of rivers, streams, canals and ditches. Does it reach all the veins and arterioles of the nation's waters, and all the wetlands that drain into them? Does it end with the waterways that are actually navigable and the wetlands abutting them? Or is it some place in between? Also at issue are who draws those lines -- and how -- and who decides what the Clean Water Act means by ''navigable waters'' and ''the waters of the United States.'' Tucked into the larger question is the issue of how many of the nation's 100 million or so acres of wetlands have a close enough connection, or nexus, to regulated waters to fit under the same regulatory umbrella. The twin cases, blending questions of hydrology and federalism, take aim at the constitutional and legal underpinnings of the federally run system that controls the health of the nation's web of waterways. The developers argue that the federal custodians of the Clean Water Act have overreached by asserting jurisdiction over ditches and wetlands far from the large waterways over which Congress has clear authority. In addition, the cases bring a rich cast of characters to the court. It includes a cantankerous developer who has likened environmental regulators to Nazis, a legal foundation dedicated to reining in government and a diverse group of supporters on both sides, including the Western Coalition of Arid States, the Association of California Water Agencies, the American Petroleum Institute and the libertarian Cato Institute. M. Reed Hopper of the Pacific Legal Foundation, who represents one developer, John A. Rapanos, argues that the existing interpretation of the law infringes on the rights of states and individuals and impermissibly gives the federal government authority over ''any area over which water flows, including a public street with an attached storm drain, a private lawn that drains to the street or, quite literally, the kitchen sink.'' In response, the government, backed by major environmental groups, federal and state regulators and a bipartisan group of former administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency, says that the theories of Mr. Rapanos and his fellow developer, June Carabell, would remove more than half of existing waterways -- perhaps as many as 99 percent, by one estimate -- from federal water pollution controls. In addition, they argue, if the court were to uphold the developers' position, the result would be to upend a decades-old regulatory system. Wetlands are nurseries for creatures at the bottom of many food chains, filters that keep some nutrients and pollutants out of streams, and buffers against flooding. If the court interpreted the Clean Water Act as controlling only actually navigable waterways and their immediate tributaries and adjacent wetlands, ''then discharges of such materials as sewage, toxic chemicals and medical waste into those tributaries would not be subject'' to regulation under the law, the solicitor general, Paul D. Clement, wrote in the government's brief. Both developers sought to fill wetlands to make way for development -- in Mr. Rapanos's case, a shopping mall in Midland, Mich.; in the case of Ms. Carabell, a condominium in Chesterfield Township. Mr. Rapanos defied state regulators, who, acting with federal authority specifically delegated by the E.P.A., told him not to fill his wetland without a permit. Ms. Carabell applied for a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers and was rejected. The two cases present physical as well as legal differences. The wetlands owned by Mr. Rapanos -- two others, in addition to the one where the shopping center was once planned -- are as far as 20 miles from local rivers, but adjacent to ditches that drain into tributaries of those rivers. Ms. Carabell's wetlands abut a ditch that drains into nearby Lake St. Clair, but are separated from the ditch by an earthen berm. The legal arguments in the briefs pit two recent Supreme Court precedents against each other. In a 1985 California case, United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, the court observed that Congress had intended ''to regulate at least some waters that would not be deemed 'navigable' under the classical understanding of that term.'' Referring to the role of wetlands in protecting larger waterways, the court said that activity in wetlands abutting open waterways could be controlled by the corps. In this case, the government argues that the court should extend the authority of the corps to wetlands abutting tributaries of actually navigable waters. The constitutional lever through which the control is exercised is the Commerce Clause, which provides for federal control both over direct avenues of commerce -- like waterways crucial to trade -- and over issues that ''substantially affect'' interstate commerce. In 2001, in an Illinois case, Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. United States, the court said the corps overreached its legal and constitutional authority by claiming control over an isolated quarry. The quarry had filled with water and was used by migratory birds, which are protected under federal law. The court ruled that there had to be a ''significant nexus'' between the regulated wetland or stream and true ''navigable waters.'' If not, regulation of the water body fell to the state. Most states represented in the amicus briefs, minus Alaska (where most of the country's wetlands are located) and Utah, back the government. A brief for state and regional water pollution officials said states ''know they cannot adequately protect these resources acting alone.'' As Douglas Kendall, one of the lawyers for these officials, explained, a downstream state could suffer the pollution from a neighbor raking in tax revenues off the associated development. The downstream state, he said, would have clear economic incentives to do the same. But the brief for Alaska, Utah, the California Farm Bureau and several Western water authorities argues that ''the wetlands in these cases did not have a 'significant nexus' to navigable waters because they were not adjacent to navigable waters; did not significantly affect navigation or interstate commerce in such waters; and had no apparent, significant effects on the actual flows or condition of such waters.'' That brief argues that it is the federal control over navigation that gives the E.P.A. and the corps authority over navigable waters, and that unless their regulations directly prevent impediments to navigation -- unless, for example, they deal with issues like the level of river flows -- the issues fall to the states. The act, the brief argues, ''authorizes federal jurisdiction up to the limits of the navigation power but not beyond.''"
"Two more radioactive contaminants have shown up in the groundwater under the Indian Point nuclear reactor complex in Westchester County, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said on Tuesday. But the agency and the plant owner, Entergy Nuclear Northeast, said they did not pose a hazard. For the last few months, plant technicians have been trying to find the flaw that is allowing water with tritium in it to seep out of the spent fuel pool for the Indian Point 2 reactor, but one of the radioactive materials discovered on Tuesday, nickel-63, is more likely to have come from the pool at Indian Point 1, a plant official said. Unit 1's pool has been leaking for years, and Entergy has a pumping system in place to return the water to the pool. ''We're capturing most of it, but we don't know for sure we're getting all of it,'' said Jim Steets, a plant spokesman. The other material announced on Tuesday is strontium, in concentrations about three times above the drinking water standard, in a sample taken from a well inside a building at Indian Point. But Diane Screnci, a spokeswoman for the commission, said, ''It's not a drinking water source, and it doesn't lead to a drinking water source.'' The contaminated water is presumed to go into the Hudson River, which plant officials say dilutes the contaminants to extremely small levels and is not used for drinking. Indian Point 1 used fuel clad in stainless steel, an alloy that includes nickel. In the reactor, the nickel can become radioactive. While the reactor has not run in 30 years, the half-life of nickel-63, the period in which it loses half its radioactivity, is 96 years."
"The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said in a report released yesterday that the risk from the tritium-contaminated water leaking from the Indian Point 2 nuclear reactor is so small that it is unlikely to affect the health of plant workers or the public. The leak was discovered last fall next to the spent-fuel pool for Indian Point 2, which is in Westchester County, as workers dug a new foundation for a crane that will take fuel out of the pool for storage in dry casks. Water in the pool is contaminated with tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen that is incorporated into the water just as normal hydrogen is. Several weeks ago, samples from a new monitoring well found that the tritium has come closer to the Hudson River than previously believed, although the presumption since the leak's discovery was that the tritium would eventually reach the river. In its report, the commission said it had ''not found any condition that indicates that occupational or public health and safety have been, or likely will be, affected by the current onsite groundwater contamination.'' The commission said it had reviewed, and did not dispute, an estimate by the plant owner, Entergy, that the largest direct exposure that a member of the public could receive from the leaking tritium was less than one ten-thousandth of 1 percent of the maximum that the plant is allowed to cause by leaking liquids. The figure refers only to the leak, and not from the routine, planned releases of slightly radioactive liquids into the Hudson River. Those are far larger than the amount being leaked, but still well below legal limits, plant operators say. The dose would be minuscule compared to background doses from natural sources, according to radiation experts. The report also noted that New York State had found a second radioactive material, strontium-90, in the water, but that the commission's own tests had not; it said that further tests were pending."
"If you stand outside the Holt family home late at night, after everyone has gone to sleep, with the sound of a soft wind drifting through the trees and the damp sweet smell of abundant grass heavy in the humid air, you can easily imagine what this area was like in the days of slavery. And then the quiet is broken by the sudden eruption of dogs barking and howling on nearby property, and you're reminded that the tiny population of blacks in Dickson County, even after all these years, is still frequently treated -- literally -- like garbage. The property adjacent to the Holt family home is a government-owned landfill. The howling dogs are housed in a pound right next to the landfill. The noise is a nuisance, but it's the least of the family's problems. Toxic chemicals from the landfill have polluted the pristine water that was once drawn from the Holt family well. Unaware that the water was contaminated, the family drank it for years. Now the Holts are convinced that the poisons that seeped for so long from the landfill into the groundwater are responsible for the potentially deadly diseases that have struck several members of the family. The Holts were not just unaware that their water was contaminated; they had been assured by federal environmental officials way back in 1991 that the water had been tested and was safe to drink. ''They told us,'' said Sheila Holt-Orsted, who grew up on the property, ''that the water wouldn't hurt us, and that we shouldn't worry about it.'' In fact, government records show that dangerous levels of trichloroethylene (TCE), a suspected carcinogen, had been found in the water as early as 1988. The family drank the poisoned water for more than a dozen years after that. During that time, the government warned white families that the water had been contaminated and provided them with an alternate source of drinking water. The Holts, who are black, were left oblivious to the danger. Welcome to the world of environmental racism, a subject that doesn't get nearly enough attention. The Holts' property is on Eno Road, a quiet rustic area with an interesting history. Hundreds of acres of land along the road were acquired by blacks in the post-slavery period. Only recently freed, they were proud of being landowners. The Holts have lived in the community for many decades. Blacks make up just 4.5 percent of the Dickson County population, and they have always been clustered in the vicinity of Eno Road. This has been a great convenience for the whites, who have run the local governments. For six decades, the Eno Road community has been designated as the place for whites to dump their garbage. ''The city and county fathers singled out this small, rural and mostly black Eno Road community to locate their garbage dumps, landfills, transfer stations, toxic waste sites -- you name it,'' said Dr. Robert Bullard, director of the Environmental Justice Resource Center at Clark Atlanta University. ''These waste sites are all located on Eno Road.'' When I asked the mayor of Dickson County, Robert Stone, why that particular community had been chosen to absorb so much of the county's garbage, he said he couldn't respond because the Holts had filed a lawsuit against the county. He referred me to a lawyer, Eric Thornton, who asked why anyone would think it was peculiar to dump the garbage there. ''It has to be at some location,'' he said. He denied that race had anything to do with the selection process, noting that there were also whites who lived nearby. The ingestion of TCE, commonly used as a metal degreaser, has been associated with a variety of cancers, heart disease, impairment of the nervous system, stroke, liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes and other extremely serious disorders. At various times, the concentration of TCE in the well water of the Holt family was 24 and 29 times as high as the maximum level of five parts per billion set by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Sheila Holt-Orsted has undergone six surgeries and chemotherapy for breast cancer. Her father was stricken with prostate cancer. During a conversation in her front yard, less than 50 feet from the landfill, she told me: ''My aunt, who lives next door, she had cancer. And then there was another neighbor who had cancer. I said, you know, 'Something is not right here.' '' Op-Ed Columnist"
"The Supreme Court ruled Monday that operators of hydroelectric dams must meet a state's water quality requirements in order to qualify for a federal license. The unanimous decision was the court's first ruling in an environmental case under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., and it came as a relief to environmental advocates. Justice David H. Souter's opinion for the court upheld a ruling by the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine. The justices rejected the argument of a company that owns five dams on the Presumpscot River, which runs through Portland, that it did not need state approval because its operations did not add pollutants to the water that passed over its dams and through its turbines. The company, S. D. Warren Company, a subsidiary of South African Pulp and Paper Industries Ltd., uses the power it generates to run a paper mill in Westbrook, Me. The dispute arose when the company prepared to renew its federal licenses. A federal law, the Clean Water Act, requires an applicant for a federal license or license renewal to first obtain state certification if its activities ''may result in any discharge into the navigable waters.'' Congress did not define the word ''discharge,'' and the company argued that the word should be understood to refer to the addition of pollutants. Since it was not adding anything to the water, the company argued, Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, requiring state certification, did not apply to its activities. To the contrary, Justice Souter said, there was no reason not to give the word ''discharge'' its plain, everyday meaning: ''flowing or issuing out.'' The flow of water over a dam was therefore a ''discharge,'' he said. The decision applies to about 2,500 hydroelectric dams on 500 rivers in 45 states. Justice Souter said that the Clean Water Act was concerned with water quality and that alteration in water quality ''is a risk inherent in limiting river flow and releasing water through turbines.'' He noted that Maine's environmental agency had concluded that S. D. Warren's dams had caused ''long stretches'' of the riverbed to become ''essentially dry'' and had blocked the passage of eels and spawning fish. The state agency made its approval contingent on S. D. Warren's maintaining a minimum water flow over its dams, a conclusion that the company challenged unsuccessfully in state court. In his opinion on Monday, S. D. Warren Company v. Maine Board of Environmental Protection, No. 04-1527, Justice Souter said that ''changes in the river like these fall within a state's legitimate legislative business, and the Clean Water Act provides for a system that respects the states' concerns.'' Environmental groups had been alarmed by the court's decision last fall to hear the company's appeal in the absence of the usual reasons for a grant of Supreme Court review, such as a conflict among the lower courts on the interpretation of a federal law. Every court to consider the meaning of ''discharge'' had reached the same conclusion. The Bush administration had argued in the case in support of Maine. Environmental advocates were also pleasantly surprised by another development at the court on Monday in a case that found them opposing the administration. The justices rejected the Bush administration's advice and agreed to hear an appeal by a coalition of environmental groups of a lower court's interpretation of another important issue under another major statute, the Clean Air Act. The question in the new case, Environmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corporation, No. 05-848, is the validity of the method by which the Environmental Protection Agency measures emissions from power plants and other industrial facilities that are subject to the agency's ''new source review'' program for installing new pollution controls. The dispute is over whether emissions are to be measured hourly or yearly. The hourly measure, favored by industry, does not measure an overall increase in emissions if plants operate for a greater number of hours. Consequently, the E.P.A. had long insisted on the yearly measurement. During the Clinton administration, the agency brought a series of enforcement actions, with the resulting litigation lingering into the Bush years. In this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled late last year that the agency had to use the hourly measure. The administration did not appeal to the Supreme Court, instead announcing that it would acquiesce in the decision and would issue a new set of rules. Citing the new rulemaking procedure, it urged the justices to turn down the appeal filed by the environmental groups and supported by 14 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The justices' decision to hear the case now requires the administration to decide whether to defend the agency's previous position or formally abandon it. The case contains the additional question of whether the Fourth Circuit, which sits in Richmond, Va., had jurisdiction to address the agency rules in the first place. Ordinarily, challenges to rules issued by the Environmental Protection Agency must be filed exclusively in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A week after the Fourth Circuit ruling, the District of Columbia Circuit addressed the same issue in a separate case and reached the opposite conclusion. In another development on Monday, the court turned down appeals filed by both the federal government and Cayuga Indian Nation of New York of a ruling that overturned a $248 million judgment on behalf of the Indians against New York State. The judgment, awarded to the Cayugas in 1992 by Judge Neal P. McCurn of Federal District Court in Syracuse, was to compensate the Indians for purchases of their tribal land that New York made in the late 1700's in violation of federal law. The federal government entered the case on the Indians' behalf. Last year, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, dismissed the lawsuit on the ground that the Indians had waited too long to bring it. Both the government, in United States v. Pataki, No. 05-978, and the tribe, in Cayuga Indian Nation v. Pataki, No. 05-982, filed Supreme Court appeals, arguing that the Second Circuit had misapplied a doctrine of the common law known as laches, under which legal claims that have been allowed to lapse for a long period may not be revived. Gay Rights Case Is Declined WASHINGTON, May 15 (AP) -- The Supreme Court, without comment, declined Monday to review a ruling allowing a lesbian to seek parental rights to a child she helped raise with her longtime partner. The justices have never dealt with the rights of gay people in child custody disputes. The court had been asked to review a ruling of Washington State's highest court that said the woman, Sue Ellen Carvin, could pursue ties to the girl as a ''de facto parent.''"
"Block after block, neighborhood after neighborhood, tens of thousands of hurricane-ravaged houses here rot in the sun, still waiting to be gutted or bulldozed. Now officials have decided where several million tons of their remains will be dumped: in man-made pits at the swampy eastern edge of town, out by the coffee-roasting plant and the space-shuttle factory and the big wildlife refuge. But more than a thousand Vietnamese-American families live less than two miles from the edge of the new landfill. And they are far from pleased at having the moldering remains of a national disaster plunked down nearby, alongside the canal that flooded their neighborhood when Hurricane Katrina surged through last year. Environmental groups are also angry, accusing local and federal officials of ignoring or circumventing their own regulations, long after the immediate emergency has ended. The same thing happened after Hurricane Betsy in 1965, they warn, and that dump ended up becoming a Superfund site. The new landfill, known as Chef Menteur after the highway that borders it, sits across a canal from Bayou Sauvage, the largest urban wildlife refuge in the country, with 23,000 acres of marshland, canals and lagoons that are home to herons, egrets, alligators and, in the fall, tens of thousands of migratory ducks. Nonetheless, the landfill lacks some of the safeguards that existing dumps do, like special clay liners. The government says they are not needed because demolition debris is cleaner than other rubbish. Residents and environmentalists think otherwise, because after Hurricane Katrina the state expanded the definition of construction and demolition debris to include most of a house's contents, down to the moldy mattresses and soggy sofas. ''It's essentially the guts of your house, all your personal possessions,'' said Joel Waltzer, a lawyer representing landfill opponents. ''Electronics, personal-care products, cleaning solutions, pesticides, fertilizers, bleach.'' State officials say that the new landfill is safe and that they are simply moving quickly to protect public health and the environment, using techniques that did not exist 40 years ago. The new site was chosen to speed up the cleanup, they say, because the debris will not have to be hauled far. The state estimates that 7.2 million tons of hurricane debris remains to be cleaned up; the Chef Menteur landfill will take 2.6 million tons. ''You cannot rebuild until you clean up,'' said Chuck Carr Brown, an assistant secretary of the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, which provided a permit for the landfill. ''I'm still in the eye of the storm.'' The state has agreed to do some extra monitoring of groundwater, Dr. Brown said. But it has determined ''there's nothing toxic, nothing hazardous,'' he continued. ''There will be no impact'' on the community, which is sometimes called Versailles. Like so many disputes that have erupted since the hurricane, this one involves some highly charged issues: politics, money, history and race. Not to mention a highly developed distrust of government that almost all Louisianians now seem to share. Unlike most residents of eastern New Orleans, the Vietnamese have returned, rebuilt and drawn up elaborate plans for their 30-year-old community's future. Now they feel unwelcome, said the Rev. Vien thé Nguyen, the pastor of Mary Queen of Vietnam Catholic Church and a leader in the fight against the landfill, which opened on April 26. ''They're threatening our very existence,'' Father Vien said of the government agencies that approved the dump site, which residents fear will tower 80 feet or more above their neighborhood, dwarfing the new church they are planning to build, once the Federal Emergency Management Agency trailers are gone from the site. Father Vien said he was particularly worried about the quality of water in the canal and the lagoon that run through the neighborhood of tidy brick houses. Residents use that water on the tiny waterside gardens that supply the community with sugar cane and bitter melon and Vietnamese varieties of vegetables, he said. He and his parishioners are particularly angry at Mayor C. Ray Nagin, who in February used emergency powers to waive zoning regulations for the landfill. ''Maybe we're not the right kind of people he wanted to return,'' Father Vien said. Neither the mayor nor his staff responded to requests for response to the priest's comments. The state and the Army Corps of Engineers, which is handling cleanup in the city, say that without the dump, the cleanup would take much longer. The existing dumps would not be able to process all the debris fast enough, officials say, and are too far from the blighted buildings. And the need for the new dump will only increase, they say, as the cleanup progresses. Maurice Falk, the corps official in charge of the cleanup, said at a federal court hearing last week that only 115 houses have been demolished so far. Given that slow pace, critics question why the landfill had to be opened so quickly, before environmental studies were prepared and the community was consulted. The community would be willing to negotiate a compromise and do its part in the cleanup of the city, said Kelly H. Tran, who lives in the Vietnamese enclave and with her husband runs a construction company that has been fixing damaged houses. But, she continued, ''It's not fair for us to have no voice in this big decision, this critical decision.'' State officials said they had reviewed the site for a landfill in the past, when political opposition had blocked it, and now simply could not wait two or three months to get through the public comment period. But on April 28, after the opposition was in full cry, the state and the corps put out a notice soliciting public comment on the landfill. If residents or opponents ''have something we missed, we'll address it,'' said Mike D. McDaniel, the secretary of the State Department of Environmental Quality. As for those who argue that there is no emergency involved, he disagrees. ''Some people can't seem to understand this is not business as usual,'' he said. Environmental groups are not happy. Adam Babich, director of the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic, said government agencies in the region had never been vigilant about complying with environmental regulations but had been especially lax since the storm. This attitude is most apparent, he said, when it comes to landfills. In nearby Plaquemines Parish, a longtime dispute over a landfill has flared up because the dump is taking in Hurricane Katrina debris. And sparring continues over the Old Gentilly landfill, an old-fashioned, unlined dump that the state closed in 1986 but reopened after the hurricane. It is now accepting a limited amount of debris after a suit was filed by the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, one of the groups represented by Mr. Waltzer, and it was criticized in a report commissioned by FEMA. The fight over the new landfill is by no means over, Father Vien said. On April 27 he was showing visitors the site -- and admiring the alligators gliding through the adjacent Maxent Canal -- when he got the news from Mr. Waltzer that a federal judge had refused to issue a temporary injunction against the dump. At first he seemed stunned. ''I cannot believe that,'' he repeated several times. Then he rallied. ''The game is not over,'' he said. ''It just started, actually.''"
"The Supreme Court on Monday came close to rolling back one of the country's fundamental environmental laws, issuing a fractured decision that, while likely to preserve vigorous federal enforcement of the law, the Clean Water Act, is also likely to lead to new regulatory battles, increased litigation by property owners and a push for new legislation. With four justices on one side arguing for a sharp restriction in the definition of wetlands that are subject to federal jurisdiction, and four justices on the other arguing for retaining the broad definition that the Army Corps of Engineers has used for decades, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy controlled the outcome in a solitary opinion. Justice Kennedy said that to come within federal protection under a proper interpretation of the Clean Water Act, a wetland needs to have a ''significant nexus'' to a body of water that is actually navigable. He then made clear, in his 30-page opinion, that whether such a relationship existed in any specific case was largely a technical and scientific judgment on which courts should defer to the federal regulators. The four parcels of land at issue in the case, all in Michigan, were likely to meet the definition, he said. Environmental advocacy groups reacted to the decision, which sends the cases back to an appeals court, as if they had dodged a bullet, which in many respects they had. An opinion for four justices, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, would have stripped protection from many areas that federal regulators have treated as wetlands under the 1972 law. Justice Scalia's opinion, joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr., said the Army Corps of Engineers had stretched its authority under the Clean Water Act ''beyond parody'' by regulating land that contained nothing but storm sewers, drainage ditches and ''dry arroyos in the middle of the desert.'' He said the agency had trampled on state authority by exercising a ''scope of discretion that would befit a local zoning board.'' The only wetlands properly subject to federal jurisdiction, Justice Scalia said, are those ''with a continuous surface connection'' to actual waterways, ''so that there is no clear demarcation between 'waters' and wetlands.'' The waters to which the wetlands must be adjacent, he continued, are only those that are ''relatively permanent, standing or flowing.'' These are the only bodies of water that come within the statute's reference to ''the waters of the United States,'' he said. On the other side was Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. Accusing the Scalia group of ''antagonism to environmentalism,'' Justice Stevens said the Scalia opinion ''needlessly jeopardizes the quality of our waters.'' Further, Justice Stevens said, the Scalia group ''disregards the deference it owes the executive'' as well as ''its own obligation to interpret laws rather than to make them.'' This, of course, was a sly reference to the slogan often heard in connection with conservative nominations to the federal courts. In effect, Justice Stevens was accusing the Scalia group of judicial activism. The case, which was argued in February and was the oldest undecided case on the court's docket, was clearly the subject of a major internal battle that undercut any image of good fellowship and unanimity on the Roberts court. The chief justice himself wrote a brief concurring opinion, noting that ''it is unfortunate that no opinion commands a majority of the court.'' He added: ''What is unusual in this instance, perhaps, is how readily the situation could have been avoided.'' It was not clear whether he was aiming this comment at Justice Kennedy or at the Army Corps of Engineers, which he said had failed to respond properly to a Supreme Court decision five years ago that rejected federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act over isolated ponds visited by migratory birds. The chief justice noted that the Army Corps had embarked after that decision on issuing new, more limited regulations, but had abandoned the effort. ''Rather than refining its view of its authority in light of our decision,'' he said, ''the Corps chose to adhere to its essentially boundless view of the scope of its power.'' He concluded: ''The upshot today is another defeat for the agency.'' Given Justice Kennedy's refusal to go along, the extent of that defeat was far from certain. At the least, the Army Corps of Engineers may now feel impelled to embark on a new rulemaking process, leading to a regulation that would incorporate Justice Kennedy's ''significant nexus'' test. Under that test, regulators need not show that a wetland is adjacent to, or connected with, a navigable body of water. Rather, it is sufficient to show that it is adjacent to a tributary that itself flows into such waters. Justice Kennedy said the Corps needed to be more specific in defining the tributaries that count for this purpose. He said it needed to identify those ''categories of tributaries'' that were ''significant enough that wetlands adjacent to them are likely, in the majority of cases, to perform important functions for an aquatic system incorporating navigable waters.'' The current standard used by the Corps, he said, was too open-ended in permitting regulation of remote drains, ditches and streams that did not affect ''the integrity of an aquatic system.'' The impact of this approach will become more clear when the appeals court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, revisits the two decisions that the Supreme Court vacated. With Justice Kennedy agreeing that the appeals court needed to take a fresh look at the cases, there were five votes for a judgment to ''vacate and remand.'' But as Justice Stevens pointed out, one ''unusual feature'' of the judgment was that there were not five votes for the standard that the appeals court should apply. The judgments should be reinstated as long as the appeals court finds that Justice Kennedy's test is met, disregarding the test proposed by Justice Scalia, Justice Stevens said. The appeals court, in two separate cases, ruled against Michigan property owners in their battles with federal regulators. In the lead case, Rapanos v. United States, No. 04-1034, John A. Rapanos, after being informed that three parcels he wanted to develop probably contained regulated wetlands, cleared and filled the land without obtaining a Clean Water Act permit. The government brought criminal charges against Mr. Rapanos. He was convicted, and the Supreme Court denied review of his case in 2004. The case the court decided on Monday grew out of his appeal in a civil case the government brought against him, in which he faces millions of dollars in fines. His property is as much as 20 miles away from water that is navigable in the traditional sense. But the parcels are within the drainage systems of Lake Huron and two navigable rivers. In the second case, Carabell v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, No. 04-1034, the Army Corps denied a permit to a couple who wanted to fill part of their property in order to develop condominiums. In both cases, the property owners challenged the jurisdiction of the Army Corps both under the Clean Water Act and under the Constitution, arguing that if Congress had conferred such broad jurisdiction in the Clean Water Act, it exceeded its authority under the Commerce Clause. Justice Scalia's opinion, without directly endorsing the constitutional attack, said the agency's interpretation of its authority ''stretches the outer limits of Congress's commerce power.'' Justice Kennedy, however, said that wetlands as defined by his test ''raise no serious constitutional or federalism difficulty.'' However the case unfolds from here, it was plain that something went awry in the court's handling of its most high-profile environmental case in years. Given the structure of the principal opinions, including their relative length and tone, it is possible that Justice Stevens had initially controlled the case and, on the assumption that he had five votes on his side, had assigned it to Justice Kennedy, who then strayed somewhat from the more categorical view of the Stevens four. Although he speaks only for himself, his opinion reads like a majority opinion, while Justice Scalia's opinion reads like a dissent."
"Nassau County warned the residents of four communities yesterday to use bottled water after a possibly carcinogenic gasoline additive was discovered in their water system. While urging the precautions, health officials said there should be no immediate harm from the limited exposure to the additive, methyl tertiary butyl ether, known as MTBE. And water district officials said they hoped to have clean water by today. The contaminated water system, part of the West Hempstead-Hempstead Gardens water district, serves 33,000 people in West Hempstead and parts of Franklin Square, Garden City South and Cathedral Gardens. Notices of the problem were delivered door-to-door early yesterday. District officials shut down a contaminated well, flushed the water mains, submitted new samples for testing and were working to restore clean water. When that happens, new notices will be sent, said Robert P. York, the district superintendent. The low level and limited duration of contamination did not pose immediate harm, Dr. David Ackman, the county health commissioner, said at a news conference yesterday at Health Department offices in Garden City. But as a precaution, he recommended against using the contaminated water for drinking, cooking, making ice cubes or brushing teeth. Residents were urged to limit use of the water in bathing and house cleaning, to avoid inhaling vapors and absorbing contamination through the skin. Since the contaminant tends to evaporate, health officials also urged residents to ventilate areas where the water was used. MTBE used to be added to fuel to help reduce carbon monoxide and ozone emissions. State law now bans it as a potential carcinogen. State regulations on drinkable water limit MTBE to 10 parts per billion. But three water samples taken on Friday and tested on Monday by the water district and Health Department officials showed counts of 13, 14 and 15, health officials said. According to the water district, the safety standard assumes an exposure of drinking two liters of tainted water a day for 70 years. Exactly how long the contamination existed is not known. But since the water is tested monthly, the maximum exposure would be a month, a Health Department spokeswoman said."
"More than two billion people already live in regions facing a scarcity of water, and unless the world changes its ways over the next 50 years, the amount of water needed for a rapidly growing population will double, scientists warned in a study released yesterday. At the worst, a deepening water crisis would fuel violent conflicts, dry up rivers and increase groundwater pollution, their report says. It would also force the rural poor to clear ever more grasslands and forests to grow food and leave many more people hungry. The report, which draws on the research of more than 400 hydrologists, agronomists and other scientists, was sponsored by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, the world's premier network of agricultural research centers, among others. The authors of the report, ''Water for Good, Water for Life: Insights from the Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture,'' concluded that countries confronting severe water shortages cannot simply employ the same strategies for increasing food production that have had dramatic success over the past half-century. Since 1950, the acreage of land under irrigation -- a driving factor behind the Green Revolution that helped Asia feed itself -- has tripled. But some parts of the world, including the breadbaskets of India and China, the cotton belt of Central Asia and swaths of the Middle East, are reaching the physical limits of their water supplies. Sub-Saharan Africa, the world's poorest region, has lacked the financial wherewithal to build dams and irrigation systems to get water to farms and homes in rural areas where most people live. ''We have to learn how to grow more food with less water,'' said David Molden, the principal researcher at the International Water Management Institute in Sri Lanka and the coordinator of the study. ''That's imperative. We can't just keep expanding the land used.'' In Africa, where having an adequate food supply is still a life-and-death issue, the scholars say governments and donors should focus on relatively inexpensive, small-scale methods for irrigating small, often widely scattered plots of land. For example, farmers could use small tanks to store rainwater and apply it to crops through simple drip irrigation during dry spells. Farmers could also operate treadle pumps to tap into groundwater. Such pumps work like a stair stepper in the gym, cost only $50 to $100 each and are powered by the farmer's own labor, not costly fuels. ''A lot more people could benefit from these small-scale technologies in Africa than from a large dam,'' said Mr. Molden, a hydrologist. ''You can buy a treadle pump and install it immediately. You have to wait 5 or 10 years for a dam to be built.'' But the authors of the study, released in Stockholm at an international conference on water, also note that while these technologies may be simple, installing them on a national scale and maintaining their use would be no easy matter. For example, a country like Ethiopia, with very low rural literacy levels, would need to train people to carry out such a plan. Water alone would not be enough. Farmers need credit, crop insurance and roads to get their products to market. They need AIDS treatment, and they need fertilizers to nourish their land. A major study released in March found that three-quarters of sub-Saharan Africa's farmland is severely depleted of basic nutrients to grow crops. The report also raised the specter of global climate change, and its potential to alter patterns of rainfall, especially in the poor countries near the Equator. The more rapid glacial melt in the Himalayas is now increasing the water flowing into India, Nepal, Pakistan and China, but it may mean much less water in future years, the report said. ''To me, that's quite frightening,'' Mr. Molden said."
"The number of closings and health advisory days at beaches across the United States increased by about 5 percent in 2005 from 2004, according to a report released Thursday by the Natural Resources Defense Council. The change was partly caused by improved monitoring of water quality in 29 coastal states but also by pollution from continuing coastal development. The council, an environmental watchdog group based in New York, which examined data collected by the Environmental Protection Agency, said that 8 percent of all water samples taken at beaches nationwide exceeded what the report called ''the national daily bacterial standard.'' The council also filed a lawsuit against the E.P.A. on Thursday, in conjunction with its annual report on beaches, saying the current clean water standards were outdated. The council said the agency had failed to devise new standards as required by Congress in the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act, passed in 2000. The law included instructions for the agency to update public health standards and the way it tests for pollution in coastal areas by October 2005. ''They're years behind,'' said Nancy Stoner, director of the council's Clean Water Project. ''I'm trying to get them on a schedule to do what Congress told them to do,'' she said. Ms. Stoner said the outdated federal standards were focused largely on testing for bacterial contamination and did not track pollutants like cryptosporidium, which she said caused widespread contamination of drinking water in Milwaukee in 1993. A spokesman for the E.P.A., Dale Kemery, would not directly comment on the lawsuit. Mr. Kemery released a statement that he said addressed the delay by the agency. ''The ecology of beach water is complex and has required much study to understand the variables that affect its health and safety,'' the statement said. It added, ''E.P.A. must determine what kind of studies are needed to fill the gaps in scientific knowledge and expects to publish its findings in early 2007.'' The agency also took a different view of the trend in beach water quality. It said that even though the number of beaches monitored in 2005 -- a total of 4,025 -- was an 11 percent increase over 2004, that 4 percent of all days monitored last year had advisories compared with 6 percent when the agency started compiling the data in 2002. The decline occurred despite the effects last year of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the Gulf Coast. Several states experienced sharp increases in the number of closings and advisories in 2005, but the E.P.A. and the council agreed that the increases often reflected better testing and communication rather than huge increases in pollution. In Washington State, which the council report said had a 200 percent increase in the number of beach closings or advisory days, the council said the State Department of Ecology had done a better job of exchanging information about sewer line breaks or overflows with the State Department of Health. That department, in turn, had done a better job of informing the Ecology Department when certain beaches consistently showed high levels of pollution. Glenn Kuper, a spokesman for the Ecology Department, said that the improved communication had been possible through a grant from the E.P.A., now providing financing in its fourth year. Despite the large increase in advisories and closings in the state, only 3 percent of the samples from 73 beaches in Washington exceeded the national standards set by the Beach Act."
"FARMERS and food safety officials still have much to figure out about the recent spate of E. coli infections linked to raw spinach. So far, no particular stomachache has been traced to any particular farm irrigated by any particular river. There is also no evidence so far that Natural Selection Foods, the huge shipper implicated in the outbreak that packages salad greens under more than two dozen brands, including Earthbound Farm, O Organic and the Farmer's Market, failed to use proper handling methods. Indeed, this epidemic, which has infected more than 100 people and resulted in at least one death, probably has little do with the folks who grow and package your greens. The detective trail ultimately leads back to a seemingly unrelated food industry -- beef and dairy cattle. First, some basic facts about this usually harmless bacterium: E. coli is abundant in the digestive systems of healthy cattle and humans, and if your potato salad happened to be carrying the average E. coli, the acid in your gut is usually enough to kill it. But the villain in this outbreak, E. coli O157:H7, is far scarier, at least for humans. Your stomach juices are not strong enough to kill this acid-loving bacterium, which is why it's more likely than other members of the E. coli family to produce abdominal cramps, diarrhea, fever and, in rare cases, fatal kidney failure. Where does this particularly virulent strain come from? It's not found in the intestinal tracts of cattle raised on their natural diet of grass, hay and other fibrous forage. No, O157 thrives in a new -- that is, recent in the history of animal diets -- biological niche: the unnaturally acidic stomachs of beef and dairy cattle fed on grain, the typical ration on most industrial farms. It's the infected manure from these grain-fed cattle that contaminates the groundwater and spreads the bacteria to produce, like spinach, growing on neighboring farms. In 2003, The Journal of Dairy Science noted that up to 80 percent of dairy cattle carry O157. (Fortunately, food safety measures prevent contaminated fecal matter from getting into most of our food most of the time.) Happily, the journal also provided a remedy based on a simple experiment. When cows were switched from a grain diet to hay for only five days, O157 declined 1,000-fold. This is good news. In a week, we could choke O157 from its favorite home -- even if beef cattle were switched to a forage diet just seven days before slaughter, it would greatly reduce cross-contamination by manure of, say, hamburger in meat-packing plants. Such a measure might have prevented the E. coli outbreak that plagued the Jack in the Box fast food chain in 1993. Unfortunately, it would take more than a week to reduce the contamination of ground water, flood water and rivers -- all irrigation sources on spinach farms -- by the E-coli-infected manure from cattle farms. The United States Department of Agriculture does recognize the threat from these huge lagoons of waste, and so pays 75 percent of the cost for a confinement cattle farmer to make manure pits watertight, either by lining them with concrete or building them above ground. But taxpayers are financing a policy that only treats the symptom, not the disease, and at great expense. There remains only one long-term remedy, and it's still the simplest one: stop feeding grain to cattle. California's spinach industry is now the financial victim of an outbreak it probably did not cause, and meanwhile, thousands of acres of other produce are still downstream from these lakes of E. coli-ridden cattle manure. So give the spinach growers a break, and direct your attention to the people in our agricultural community who just might be able to solve this deadly problem: the beef and dairy farmers.

"EIGHT years ago, Connecticut, New York and federal officials vowed to work together to prevent Long Island Sound from turning into a vast dead zone incapable of supporting striped bass, flounder, porgies, scup and other fish. They agreed that they would reduce the pollutants -- particularly nitrogen in treated sewage -- that cause oxygen levels to plummet in the western half of the Sound. (Healthy concentrations of oxygen are essential to a marine ecosystem and the creatures that live in it.) The goal was a 58.5 percent reduction, and Connecticut moved so aggressively on a well-financed plan to improve sewage plants that within a few years it was almost halfway toward its goal. The result was that the Sound enjoyed a period of small but measurable water quality improvements. In each of the last five summers, however, water quality in the Sound has been about as bad as it's ever been. Oxygen levels have fallen close to zero in more than 300 square miles, from roughly Bridgeport, Conn., and Long Island's Huntington Bay to City Island in the Bronx. Yet just when efforts to save the Sound should be increasing, the Connecticut Legislature is doing the opposite. It is backing off its cleanup commitment by slashing money for sewage plant improvements. This is particularly distressing not just because of the ecological implications but because Connecticut had been the leader in the cleanup, surpassing both New York State and New York City. After the 1998 cleanup agreement (and for several years before in anticipation of it), the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection worked with local communities, which own sewage plants in Connecticut that empty into the Sound, to plan for nitrogen reduction, and then helped to finance the sewage plant improvements. Connecticut's mechanism was the Clean Water Fund, through which it provided grants for up to 30 percent of the nitrogen removal costs and 2 percent loans to cover the rest. From 1987 through 2002, Connecticut put an average of $47.9 million a year into the Clean Water Fund. But that changed starting in 2003, when the Connecticut Legislature began taking money out of the fund, including $18 million in 2003 and $60 million in 2004, and using it for other projects, like road building and transportation initiatives. The Department of Environmental Protection had little choice but to scale back its nitrogen reduction program drastically. By how much? In 2005, Connecticut treatment plants discharged 4,947 tons of nitrogen. For 2006, the Connecticut D.E.P. had planned to require a further 17 percent reduction, to 4,110 tons, thereby getting that much closer to the 58.5 percent goal. Instead, the Connecticut D.E.P. cut back on grants and loans -- and on the size of the nitrogen reduction it will require. Rather than 17 percent, or 750 tons, it settled on a reduction of 1.1 percent, or just 55 tons for 2006. New York, on the other hand, has become the tortoise that might reach the nitrogen reduction goal of 58.5 percent first. Taken together, the treatment plants in New York that discharge into New York's part of the Sound have achieved a 19 percent cut in nitrogen discharges. And New York City, which has four big treatment plants that empty into the western end of the Sound, agreed earlier this year to follow a nitrogen reduction schedule mandated by state officials. In return, the city will get an extra three years, until 2017, to reach its 58.5 percent goal. But with Connecticut's share of the Sound cleanup stalled, far too much nitrogen will continue to enter the water, where it will encourage the growth of the algae that make up most of the Sound's plankton. The algae will then die and decompose, consuming oxygen in the process. It's worth recalling what low oxygen levels can mean. In 1987, virtually every harbor from New York City's Eastchester Bay in the west to Bridgeport, Conn., and Huntington farther east saw vast fish kills from late July through late August. Two years later there were fewer fish kills, but the near zero levels of oxygen had spread almost to New Haven. Those dire conditions led to the cleanup plan. And for a few years, oxygen levels improved. But in 2002, perhaps because of unusually warm and rainy weather, the area with the lowest oxygen levels began to grow, spreading across the waters of Westchester, Nassau and Fairfield Counties. And by last summer, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection found oxygen readings as low as 0.5 milligrams per liter off Greenwich, Conn. (In an estuary where 8 milligrams per liter is ideal, and 3.5 is the minimum for acceptable water quality, 0.5 signals an ecosystem in crisis.) But the conditions drew little attention -- so little, in fact, that the Connecticut General Assembly was able to continue ignoring the Clean Water Fund with impunity. Several environmental groups in Connecticut tried to persuade legislators to restore money for the program. But in the end they were rejected. This is a shame. Long Island Sound is both an irreplaceable ecological resource and an important economic resource. According to a study by a University of Connecticut economist, the Sound contributes $5.5 billion a year to New York's and Connecticut's economies. For the ecological and economic values to be protected, Connecticut's sewage treatment plants need to be upgraded. And the only way to do that is for the Connecticut General Assembly to return to session and come to an agreement with the governor to restore the Clean Water Fund.

"WE here on Long Island love our bays. And besides walking on their beaches and swimming in their waters, we depend on the bays in ways we don't even realize. Take the Peconic Bay. More than 1,100 businesses -- with nearly a half a billion dollars in revenue -- depend on the bay for survival. These businesses employ more than 7,300 people. But water quality in the Peconic, as in the Great South Bay and a number of other important Long Island bays, is at risk. Why? One big reason is that too many developers and property owners are clearing native vegetation and replacing it with landscaping. The result is that nitrogen and other pollutants are leaking into our bays in dangerous quantities. While all vegetation acts like a filter, removing nitrogen and other pollutants, native vegetation is especially good because unlike non-native vegetation it does not require fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides to flourish. And probably the most common non-native plant is the urban lawn, which is estimated to receive an average of five to seven pounds of pesticides per acre. By 2005, Suffolk County had identified 63 pesticide-related chemicals in groundwater. More than half of those poisonous chemicals made it into tributaries and bay waters. Fertilizer may not be a poison, but its effects can be just as bad. Thirty-one Long Island bodies of water are on New York State's Impaired Waters List, nearly a third of them because of excessive nitrogen or phosphorus, the main components of commercial fertilizer. When these nutrients get into the bays, they can kill off plants that fish and shellfish rely on for food, oxygen, spawning and habitat. Dealing with these problems is expensive. The Peconic Estuary Program, a group that protects and manages the Peconic Bay, says we need to decrease the bay's nitrogen content by 25 percent and is calling for costly sewage treatment upgrades, the development of programs in which reclaimed and treated sewage treatment plant wastewater or sludge is used as fertilizer at golf courses and regulations prohibiting building too close to wetlands. Many local groups are stepping up to shoulder some of the responsibility. Farmers are participating in voluntary, incentive-based programs that encourage them to protect water quality; and 30 golf courses in Suffolk County have pledged to curb fertilizer use. But unfortunately, these actions aren't enough. Protecting native plants is also vital. Doing that in Long Island's bay watersheds requires the leadership of local governments to create rules protecting plants and incentives advancing these protections. The Town of East Hampton took such leadership when it adopted an ordinance last year to limit the clearing of vegetation on residential properties. But other local governments can and should amend their building or zoning codes to restrict clearing, particularly in sensitive areas like the land around the Peconic Bay. Local governments should also design programs like property tax rebates to create incentives for restoring native vegetation to places where it has been cleared or otherwise lost. Protecting native vegetation needs the skill of commercial landscapers to bring us innovative and environmentally sensitive ways to care for our yards. Professional landscapers on Long Island should seek to minimize fertilizer and pesticide use. They should also encourage clients to incorporate native vegetation into their landscape design. And perhaps most important, local property owners should demand that their governments protect native vegetation, and that their landscapers learn ways to use it to create attractive yards. There's no question that our bays are important to those of us on Long Island. Making a few aesthetic changes to the way we live on the land is the least we can do to protect our water for future generations.

"Dark as soy sauce, perfumed with a chemical stench, the liquid waste from two paper mills overwhelmed the tiny village of Sugai. Villagers tried to construct a makeshift dike, but the toxic water swept it away. Fifty-seven homes sank into a black, polluted lake. The April 10 industrial spill, described by five residents of the village in Inner Mongolia, was a small-scale environmental disaster in a country with too many of them. But Sugai should have been different. The two mills had already been sued in a major case, fined and ordered to upgrade their pollution equipment after a serious spill into the Yellow River in 2004. The official response to that spill, praised by the state-run news media, seemed to showcase a new, tougher approach toward pollution -- until the later spill at Sugai revealed that local officials had never carried out the cleanup orders. Now, the destruction of Sugai is a lesson in the difficulty of enforcing environmental rules in China. ''The smell made me want to vomit,'' one villager said recently, as he showed the waist-high watermark on the remains of his home. There is no shortage of environmental laws and regulations in China, many of them passed in recent years by a central government trying to address one of the worst pollution problems in the world. But those problems persist, in part, because environmental protection is often subverted by local protectionism, corruption and regulatory inefficiency. Even as many domestic and international environmental groups now credit China with beginning to take the environment seriously, pollution is actually worsening in some crucial categories. Emissions of sulfur dioxide, the building block of acid rain, rose by 27 percent between 2000 and 2005; government projections had called for a 20 percent reduction. ''It is clear the conflict between economic growth and environmental protection is coming to a head,'' said Zhou Shengxian, director of the State Environmental Protection Administration, or SEPA, according to the official New China News Agency. The broader tension of balancing environmental protection with fast economic growth is not likely to ease. China wants to double the size of its economy by 2020. And yet Mr. Zhou did not hesitate to assign much of the blame for the undercutting of pollution control efforts to corruption and fraud by local officials. Despite its rising public profile, the State Environmental Protection Administration remains one of the weakest agencies in the central government bureaucracy and has sought to increase its regulatory powers. For years, it has complained that local environmental protection bureaus are accountable to local officials rather than the state agency. This has meant that local regulators had to answer to mayors or other local officials who may have had financial or other interests in protecting polluting industries. In early August, SEPA announced that it would establish 11 regional offices to monitor pollution problems better. The agency also announced that local officials eligible for promotion would be judged on their pollution track record, in addition to how well they deliver economic growth. Public disgust over pollution is growing. In May, the official English-language newspaper China Daily reported that more than 50,000 disputes and protests arose in 2005 over pollution. Public complaints to the national environmental administration rose by 30 percent. ''We have heard many complaints saying. 'no clean official, no clean water,' '' Zhang Lijun, a deputy director at SEPA, told China Daily. Here in Urad Qianqi, a city along the Yellow River that encompasses Sugai, officials delayed for almost five weeks before finally refusing to be interviewed about the spill. Provincial officials also declined to talk, as did administrators with the paper mills and the local irrigation district. In July, a reporter, photographer and researcher for The New York Times visited the village after being warned it was under official watch to prevent outsiders from entering. After nightfall, a sedan without license plates pursued the Times's hired car and tried to force it to the side of the road. The Times's car escaped to a highway but was later stopped by the police, who questioned the driver for about three hours. Even without official cooperation, the basic chronology of the Sugai spill can be reconstructed through interviews with villagers, the handful of accounts in the Chinese news media and reports issued by the environmental agency. For decades, the two factories, Saiwai Xinghuazhang Paper Company and Meili Beichen Paper Company, dumped their toxic sludge directly into the Yellow River. Five years ago, the introduction of new regulations ended that dumping, and factories began pumping the waste instead into a long drainage canal connected to the region's intricate irrigation and flood protection system. But in June 2004, the commission that regulates the irrigation system decided to address rising water levels in the system by dumping polluted canal water into the Yellow River. The release created a pollution slick that killed tens of thousands of fish and plunged the downstream city of Baotou into a drinking water crisis that lasted several days. Industrial accidents are common in China. Millions of residents in Harbin, in northeastern China, were forced to depend on bottled water after a major benzene spill contaminated the Songhua River last November. During the first four months of 2006, SEPA reported another 49 ''major'' industrial accidents and illegal pollution discharges. A study it released last month found that roughly 80 percent of China's 7,555 more heavily polluting factories are located on rivers, lakes or in heavily populated areas. The official handling of the 2004 spill into the Yellow River was initially considered a groundbreaking success. The city of Baotou was awarded almost $300,000 in damages from the two factories and the irrigation district in what state news media called the first pollution lawsuit on the Yellow River. Government agencies ordered the factories shut down to install water recycling and treatment equipment. SEPA ordered the mills to comply with national water emission requirements. Officials in Urad Qianqi decided instead to build large, temporary wastewater containment pools directly beside the river. Li Wanzhong, director of the Inner Mongolia Environmental Protection Bureau, concluded that those pools were a threat to the river. China Environment News, the official publication of the state environmental administration, reported that Mr. Li had ordered Urad Qianqi to close the factories if they continued to violate emissions standards. But the factories were never closed. Then, a violent storm last April set off a crisis. High winds threatened to push wastewater from the pools into the Yellow River. Villagers were told that officials feared another spill into the river would expose their failure to carry out earlier orders. So officials ordered that a containment pool wall be broken so that wastewater could be diverted into a three-mile strip beside the river where several small villages, including Sugai, stood. The only warning came from a Sugai villager who made a surreptitious telephone call from his job at one of the factories. A dozen farmers frantically tried to build a mud dike. ''The water was too high, and it didn't work,'' said one 37-year-old farmer, who, like other villagers, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. ''The water came all of a sudden. It was poisonous water, but I don't know what poisons were in it.'' Three months after the spill, the homes remained uninhabitable. Large pools of black water festered in the lowest-lying areas. All but three houses -- built on higher ground -- had been abandoned. The farmland, once considered among the best in the area, was contaminated. Most residents had relocated to nearby villages after receiving cash settlements based on the size of their home. ''The reason this accident happened is that the local government didn't follow the directives of the central government,'' said a 40-year-old man whose father had lived in the village. He added, ''They also wanted to protect the local industries.'' Urad Qianqi's Communist Party secretary, Jia Yingxiang, later told the New China News Agency that installing the required wastewater treatment plants was too expensive. He said factories were allowed to reopen because so many local workers were dependent on them. In fact, Urad Qianqi officials had promised in 2000 to build water treatment equipment but never did. Environmental regulators did examine the containment pools at the two paper mills. A government report after the April spill deemed the pools to be substandard and said that local officials and factory bosses had reduced the height of the walls to save money. Health problems connected to the spill had begun to emerge in July. A dozen or more Sugai villagers had severe rashes on their legs. On July 13, government doctors arrived with ointments. ''The doctors didn't say what was wrong with me,'' said one 40-year-old mother with large red welts and rashes on her thighs. ''It is hard to sleep at night because of the itching.'' Her husband, meanwhile, is worried about supporting his family. ''Even if we put seeds in the earth there,'' the man, 44, said, ''they won't grow because the pollution is too severe.''"
"Residues of birth control pills, antidepressants, painkillers, shampoos and a host of other compounds are finding their way into the nation's waterways, and they have public health and environmental officials in a regulatory quandary. On the one hand, there is no evidence the traces of the chemicals found so far are harmful to human beings. On the other hand, it would seem cavalier to ignore them. The pharmaceutical and personal care products, or P.P.C.P.'s, are being flushed into the nation's rivers from sewage treatment plants or leaching into groundwater from septic systems. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, researchers have found these substances, called ''emerging contaminants,'' almost everywhere they have looked for them. Most experts say their discovery reflects better sensing technology as much as anything else. Still, as Hal Zenick of the agency's office of research and development put it in an e-mail message, ''there is uncertainty as to the risk to humans.'' In part, that is because the extent and consequences of human exposure to these compounds, especially in combination, are ''unknown,'' the Food and Drug Administration said in a review issued in 2005. And aging and increasingly medicated Americans are using more of these products than ever. So officials who deal with these compounds have the complex task of balancing reassurance that they take the situation seriously with reassurance that there is probably nothing to worry about. As a result, scientists in several government and private agencies are devising new ways to measure and analyze the compounds, determine their prevalence in the environment, figure out where they come from, how they move, where they end up and if they have any effects. In many cases, the compounds enter the water when people excrete them or wash them away in the shower. But some are flushed or washed down the drain when people discard outdated or unused drugs. So a number of states and localities around the country have started discouraging pharmacies, hospitals, nursing homes and residents from disposing of drugs this way. Some are setting up ''pharmaceutical take-back locations'' in drugstores or even police stations. Others are adding pharmaceuticals to the list of hazardous household waste, like leftover paint or insecticides, periodically collected for safe disposal, often by incineration. For example, Clark County, Wash., has a program in which residents with unwanted or expired drugs can take so-called controlled substances, like prescription narcotics, to police stations or sheriffs' offices for disposal. They can drop noncontrolled drugs at participating pharmacies, and 80 percent of the pharmacies in the county participate. In guidelines issued in February, three federal agencies, including the E.P.A., advised people with leftover medicines to flush them down the drain ''only if the accompanying patient information specifically instructs it is safe to do so.'' Otherwise, the guidelines say, they should dispose of them in the trash (mixed with ''an undesirable substance'' like kitty litter to discourage drug-seeking Dumpster divers) or by taking them to designated take-back locations. Worries about water-borne chemicals flared last summer when researchers at the United States Geological Survey said they had discovered ''intersex fish'' in the Potomac River and its tributaries. The fish, smallmouth and largemouth bass, were male but nevertheless carried immature eggs. Scientists who worked on the project said they did not know what was causing the situation, or even if it was a new phenomenon. But the discovery renewed fears that hormone residues or chemicals that mimic them might be affecting creatures that live in the water. In a survey begun in 1999, the agency surveyed 139 streams around the country and found that 80 percent of samples contained residues of drugs like painkillers, hormones, blood pressure medicines or antibiotics. The agency said the findings suggested that the compounds were more prevalent and more persistent than had been thought. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration started looking into the effects of residues of antibiotics and antiseptics in water, not just to see if they might affect people but also to assess their potential to encourage the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Reports of contamination with pharmaceutical residues can be alarming, even when there is no evidence that anyone has been harmed. In 2004, for example, the British government reported that eight commonly used drugs had been detected in rivers receiving effluent from sewage treatment plants. A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was ''extremely unlikely'' that the residues threatened people, because they were present in very low concentrations. Nevertheless, news reports portrayed a nation of inadvertent drug users -- ''a case of hidden mass medication of the unsuspecting public,'' as one member of Parliament was quoted as saying. Christopher Daughton, a scientist at the Environmental Protection Agency and one of the first scientists to draw attention to the issue, said P.P.C.P. concentrations in municipal water supplies were even lower than they were in water generally because treatments like chlorination and filtration with activated charcoal alter or remove many chemicals. Dr. Daughton, who works at the agency's National Exposure Research Laboratory in Las Vegas, said he believed that if any living being suffered ill effects from these compounds, it would be fish and other creatures that live in rivers and streams. Dr. Daughton and Thomas A. Ternes of the ESWE-Institute for Water Research and Water Technology in Germany brought the issue to scientific prominence in 1999, in a paper in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives. They noted that pollution research efforts had focused almost exclusively on ''conventional'' pollutants -- substances that were known or suspected to be carcinogenic or immediately toxic. They urged researchers to pay more attention to pharmaceuticals and ingredients in personal care products -- not only prescription drugs and biologics, but also diagnostic agents, fragrances, sunscreen compounds and many other substances. They theorized that chronic exposure to low levels of these compounds could produce effects in water-dwelling creatures that would accumulate so slowly that they would be ''undetectable or unnoticed'' until it was too late to reverse them. The effects might be so insidious, they wrote, that they would be attributed to some slow-moving force like evolution or ecological change. Initial efforts concentrate on measuring what is getting into the nation's surface and groundwater. The discharge of pharmaceutical residues from manufacturing plants is well documented and controlled, according to the E.P.A., but the contribution from individuals in sewage or septic systems ''has been largely overlooked.'' And unlike pesticides, which are intentionally released in measured applications, or industrial discharges in air and water, whose effects have also been studied in relative detail, the environmental agency says, pharmaceutical residues pass unmeasured through wastewater treatment facilities that have not been designed to deal with them. Many of the compounds in question break down quickly in the environment. In theory, that would lessen their potential to make trouble, were it not for the fact that many are in such wide use that they are constantly replenished in the water. And researchers suspect that the volume of P.P.C.P.'s excreted into the nation's surface water and groundwater is increasing. For one thing, per capita drug use is on the rise, not only with the introduction of new drugs but also with the use of existing drugs for new purposes and among new or expanding groups of patients, like children and aging baby boomers. Also, more localities are introducing treated sewage into drinking water supplies. Researchers who have studied the issue say there is no sign that pharmaceutical residues accumulate as water is recycled. On the other hand, the F.D.A. said in its review, many contaminants ''survive wastewater treatment and biodegradation, and can be detected at low levels in the environment.'' Some say the spread of these substances in the environment is an example of how the products of science and technology can have unintended and unpredictable effects. In their view, when the knowledge about these effects is sketchy, it is best to act to reduce risk, even if the extent of the risk is unknown, an approach known as the precautionary principle. Joel A. Tickner, an environmental scientist at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, says that it is a mistake to consider all of these compounds safe ''by default,'' and that more must be done to assess their cumulative effects, individually or in combination, even at low doses. In his view, the nation's experience with lead additives, asbestos and other substances shows it can be costly -- in lives, health and dollars -- to defer action until evidence of harm is overwhelming. Others say the benefits of action -- banning some compounds, say, or requiring widespread testing or treatment for others -- should at least equal and if possible outweigh their costs. ''You have to somehow estimate as well as possible what the likely harms are and the likely benefits,'' said James K. Hammitt, a professor of economics and decision sciences at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis. And while it is possible that some of the tens of thousands of chemicals that might find their way into water supplies are more dangerous in combination than they are separately, Dr. Hammitt said in an interview, ''it's perfectly possible that they counteract each other.'' Anyway, he said, assessing their risk in combination is a mathematical problem of impossible complexity. ''The combinatorics of this are truly hopeless.'' Given all this uncertainty, policy makers find it difficult to know what to do, other than continuing their research. Studies of ''the fate and transport and persistence'' of the P.P.C.P.'s will allow scientists to make better estimates of people's exposure to them, Dr. Zenick said, and ''to assess the potential for human health effects.'' But even that normally anodyne approach comes under question because of something scientists call ''the nocebo effect'' -- real, adverse physiological reactions people sometimes develop when they learn they have been exposed to something -- even if there is no evidence it may be harmful. ''The nocebo effect could play a key role in the development of adverse health consequences from exposure even to trace elements of contaminants simply by the power of suggestion,'' Dr. Daughton wrote recently in a paper in a special issue of Ground Water Monitoring and Remediation, a publication of the National Ground Water Association, an organization of scientists, engineers and businesses related to the use of groundwater. In fact, the idea that there are unwanted chemicals in the water supply has many characteristics that researchers who study risk perception say particularly provoke dread, regardless of their real power to harm. The phenomenon is new (or newly known), and the compounds are invisible and artificial rather than naturally occurring. But scientists at agencies like the Geological Survey say it is important to understand the prevalence and actions of these compounds, even at low levels. If more is known about them, agency scientists say, researchers will be better able to predict their behavior, especially if they should start turning up at higher concentrations. Also, the Geological Survey says, tracking them at low levels is crucial to determining whether they have additive effects when they occur together in the environment. Comprehensive chemical analysis of water supplies ''is costly, extraordinarily time-consuming, and viewed by risk managers as prompting yet additional onerous and largely unanswerable questions,'' Dr. Daughton wrote in his paper last year. But it should be done anyway, he said, because it is a useful way of maintaining public confidence in the water supply. ''My work is really categorized as anticipatory research,'' he added. ''You are trying to flesh out a new topic, develop it further and see where it leads you. You don't really know where it leads.'' Correction: April 7, 2007, Saturday An article in Science Times on Tuesday about residues of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the nation's waterways misstated the given name of a scientist at the Environmental Protection Agency. He is Christian Daughton, not Christopher."
"The area in Queens where city officials found an industrial chemical in the drinking water last week has had problems with contamination by the same chemical for several years. The chemical -- tetrachloroethylene, which is commonly used by dry cleaners and auto repair shops -- has been detected sporadically in the water in Cambria Heights, Hollis and St. Albans every year since at least 2003, according to the New York City Department of Environmental Protection's annual reports of drinking water quality. Anne Canty, the department's deputy commissioner, said that testing yesterday detected continuing contamination, though at somewhat lower concentrations. Ten of 26 recent samples still contained traces of the colorless chemical, which has a sharp, sweet odor and is also known as perc. According to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, people who drink water containing tetrachloroethylene over many years can develop liver problems and may have an increased risk of cancer. In New York City, the chemical is also considered an airborne hazard because many dry cleaners are inside residential buildings where fumes can seep through ceilings and walls. The city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene does not consider the amount of tetrachloroethylene in the water a serious health problem. People who remain concerned have been told to use bottled water for cooking and drinking and to take shorter showers. The contamination was detected last week during routine water testing. The city is required to notify water users if the average level of the chemical detected in water exceeds 5 parts per billion. As testing continued this week, some readings were as high as 13 parts per billion, more than double the maximum safe level. But as of late yesterday, the average level of the chemical had dropped to 3.7 parts per billion. Most of New York City gets drinking water from reservoirs 100 or more miles away and has not had a problem with the dry cleaning chemicals. But a five-and-a-half-mile section of southeastern Queens, which includes the area where the contamination was found, is sometimes served by a system of wells that are 100 to 360 feet deep. The wells belonged to a private water company until they were taken over by the city in 1996. Many have become contaminated with a variety of pollutants, including tetrachloroethylene, and can no longer be used. In 2005, five wells were in use, providing the neighborhood's 100,000 residents with 2.2 million gallons of water a day, about 1 percent of the total used citywide every day. The wells had to be shut in February after pumps failed. The city plans to build a treatment plant for the wells, but construction is not scheduled to begin before 2009. Officials said that despite the recurring problem, they believed that the contaminated water found this week did not come from wells. An analysis of the chemical content of water indicated that it came from the main water system, officials said. Ms. Canty said water quality experts suspected that the current problem began with a faulty valve that failed to keep a small amount of chemical discharge from backing up into the drinking water system. Inspectors had checked about 300 dry cleaners and auto repair shops by midday yesterday, but the source of contamination was not discovered. In the meantime, Ms. Canty said, hydrants in the area were being flushed and the city expected the problem to be cleared up in a few days. In 2003, at least one sample of the well water in Queens exceeded 17 parts per billion. In both 2004 and 2005, tetrachloroethylene was detected in several samples and sometimes exceeded the safe level. But advisories were not issued in either year because the average of at least two consecutive readings fell below 5 parts per billion."
"When Paul Granger, the water district superintendent here, came to work one morning in 2000, he spotted a rig test-drilling for pollution at a gasoline station across the road from two wells that pump up to 1.7 million gallons of drinking water a day. He expressed concern that pollution might be threatening the water supply, and eventually his district sued three filling stations, affiliated with Exxon, Shell and Gulf. As the trial in that case opened in Garden City on Monday, the nation's water supply industry and major oil companies were watching closely. The outcome of the case could set a national precedent on who will pay the estimated tens of billions of dollars to clean up contamination caused by MTBE, a possibly carcinogenic fuel additive, now widely banned, that seeped into the ground as gasoline leaked from fuel storage tanks across the country. More than 150 other lawsuits involving MTBE from 15 states have been consolidated in United States District Court in Manhattan, with the first trial set for next spring. But because the Plainview case predated them, it is proceeding on its own in State Supreme Court. The case has a David-and-Goliath flavor, pitting a community of 32,000 residents against major oil companies. The litigation also features some of the leading lawyers involved in the consolidated federal cases. While the Plainview case is not binding on the 15 consolidated cases, the judge in the federal case, Shira A. Scheindlin, has already taken note of some of the preliminary rulings in the Plainview suit. About half the population of the United States drinks water pumped from the ground, according to the American Water Works Association, which represents 5,000 municipal and commercial suppliers. Its director of legislative affairs, Albert E. Warburton, said, ''We're concerned that the oil companies pick up their share of their liabilities for contaminating the aquifers.'' Fearing costly litigation, the gasoline industry lobbied Congress intensely for an exemption from lawsuits over MTBE, but the effort was foiled, in part by opposition from Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York. The industry estimated the national bill for cleaning up MTBE contamination at a minimum of $29 billion. Some experts have estimated costs at as high as $100 billion. Long Island is a suitable setting for a test case. Its nearly three million residents are the largest population in the country that depends exclusively on groundwater. Its automobile-dependent suburbs have fostered many hundreds of filling stations, and its porous, sandy soil hastens the movement of water -- and contamination. Nearly 2,000 gasoline leaks that were not adequately cleaned up have been documented on Long Island, said Walter Hang, who founded Toxics Targeting, a firm that tracks government reports of contamination. MTBE has been detected at 155 water wells across the island, he said. In one instance, in West Hempstead, MTBE contamination was so severe that the local water system was temporarily shut down last year. MTBE, short for methyl tert-butyl ether, was first added to gasoline to raise octane; it also fostered cleaner combustion, reducing air pollutants. But critics say it is especially dangerous because it is soluble in water, fast moving and hard to remove. The Plainview Water District has had ''440 confirmed hits of MTBE'' in the groundwater near the pumps, one of the district's lawyers, Paul Napoli, said in his opening statement before Justice Kenneth Davis, who is hearing the state case in a nonjury trial. The worst sample was 21,800 parts per billion, far above the state safety standard of 10 parts, Mr. Napoli said. The closest edge of the pollution is only 116.5 feet from a well, he added. Although MTBE has not reached the wells yet, Mr. Napoli said it is only a matter of time before it does. ''It's a slow-motion train wreck that is going on here,'' he said. State health law requires the Plainview district to take action whenever the water is threatened, Mr. Napoli said. To be prepared, the district says it needs $80 million to build special treatment plants. Otherwise, he said, when the well water is inevitably polluted, the district will have to shut down the supply for the community, in eastern Nassau County. In his opening statement, the lead defense lawyer, Peter J. Sacripanti, representing Exxon, said, ''There is no MTBE in Plainview's wells, not today, not yesterday, not ever.'' Exxon has been cleaning up its gasoline leaks, he said. The earth around the site has seven thick clay layers that retard pollution from sinking down, and groundwater moves mostly sideways, rather than down to the depth of the wells, he said. One well is 440 feet deep, and the other is 490. Moreover, the local groundwater flow is away from the wells and toward the sites of the filling stations, he said. Contaminants from a nearby industrial park pose a greater pollution threat, he said. Ridiculing the water district's underground maps as ''voodoo hydrology,'' Mr. Sacripanti said that the State Department of Environmental Conservation had declared the gasoline spills not to be hazards to the water. But the district insisted that its maps and charts are correct. It said that the state officials had insufficient data and that despite the reassurances on the safety of the water, they had repeatedly found the filling stations in violation of standards. In a coordinated defense, lawyers for the other defendants, Peter Condron for Shell and Christopher Garvey for the Gulf station and its operator, Cumberland Farms, made similar points. Mr. Sacripanti is taking a lead role in the consolidated federal cases, which have nearly 50 defendants. Mr. Napoli and his partner, Marc Bern, represent several plaintiffs in that proceeding. The Plainview case is evolving into a war of expert witnesses, with conflicting assessments of how much contamination exists and disputed projections of where it is going. The defendants said that recent measurements show the amount of contamination is subsiding. But Mr. Napoli argued that those numbers mean ''it's going deeper and deeper into the aquifer,'' beyond the testing points. More than 100 boxes of exhibits were carted to the courtroom, and 24 computer screens were set up so that the lawyers and court personnel could view various maps, charts, reports and other documents. The plaintiffs have even prepared an animated simulation of how they say the contamination is spreading. ''It's a real threat, not a fantasy,'' Mr. Napoli said. But Mr. Sacripanti said that the plaintiffs had failed to meet the legal standard that MTBE poses an imminent threat."
"The severe drought in South Florida had an upside for state water management officials who took advantage of the low water levels in Lake Okeechobee and began giving the lake bed a good cleaning. At an almost record low of 9.2 feet, the lake's water level exposed areas where oozy and polluted muck sediment containing decomposed organic matter had accumulated, covering most of the lake bed at depths of more than a foot. Officials from the South Florida Water Management District brought in bulldozers and dump trucks to several sites around the lake on Thursday to scrape the muck and expose the natural bottom in an effort to promote the regrowth of submerged aquatic vegetation and shoreline marshes, which had been suffering since the active 2004 hurricane season. The hurricanes that hit the state in 2004 and 2005 stirred up the muck, keeping sunlight from plants and lowering water clarity in the 730-square-mile lake. In just one site, water management officials expect to take about three months to dredge out 500,000 cubic yards of muck from 800 acres of lake bed. ''This is the silver lining to a drought condition,'' said Susan Gray, Lake Okeechobee program director at the South Florida Water Management District. ''It's a mixed blessing because we have to deal with the drought, but in terms of the lake itself, it's beneficial.'' The removal will also improve fish habitat by exposing the sandy areas that fish need to lay their eggs, Dr. Gray said. Earlier this month, the agency's governing board approved more than $11 million for the project, which is expected to remove a total of 3.8 million cubic yards of muck and 280 tons of phosphorous. The excavated material will be encircled by a berm along a nearby canal before its disposal is coordinated with local landowners who have expressed interest in using it, Dr. Gray said. The agency conducted a similar muck-removal project during the 2001 drought, when the lake's water level dropped below nine feet, the record low. Florida is facing one of its worst droughts ever recorded, with 41 inches of rain having fallen across the southern half of the state over the last year, more than 10 inches below the average."
"More than a century ago, Ivan Pavlov first demonstrated classical conditioning in dogs. The animals learned to associate food with a stimulus -- the sound of a bell -- such that they would salivate upon hearing the sound even when no food was present. While conditioned responses have been demonstrated in many animals with many kinds of stimuli over the years, conditioning of salivation has been shown only in one other species, humans. But to those two animals can be added a third: the cockroach. Makoto Mizunami and Hidehiro Watanabe of Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan, placed drops of sugar syrup on the mouths of American cockroaches (Periplaneta americana) while stimulating the insects' antennas -- not with sound, but with peppermint or other scents. After a number of repetitions, the cockroaches were presented with a scent alone. The researchers found that the insects salivated when the scent was one associated with the sugar syrup. The finding, published in the open-access online journal PLoS ONE, should open the way for better understanding of the neuronal basis of this kind of learning. For one thing, cockroach brains are a lot simpler than those of dogs or people, so they should be easier to study. And while there are other known conditioned responses by cockroaches, Dr. Mizunami said, salivation has the advantage that it does not cause the head to move. This makes it easier to probe the insect's neurons while the response is occurring. It's Not Just the Water. Sometimes the Sand Is Contaminated. With the arrival of summer, it's time for fun in the sand and sun -- and for the occasional beach closing because of pathogens that can cause gastrointestinal illness. Health officials determine whether a beach should be closed based on counts of E. coli bacteria in the water, an indicator of contamination by sewage (treated or untreated) or animal waste. But contamination is not necessarily just about the water, according to a new study by Satoshi Ishii and colleagues at the University of Minnesota. In a report in Environmental Science and Technology, they show that sand can play a role. The researchers studied contamination on and around a beach in the harbor shared by Duluth, Minn., and Superior, Wis., at the western tip of Lake Superior. They found that E. coli counts increased from the spring through summer and early fall, with treated sewage being the main source in spring and waste from gulls and other birds contributing a greater percentage as the months wore on. In particular, they found that beach sand contained very little bacteria in early spring, but that counts increased greatly in the ensuing months. The findings, they say, suggest that wave action brings bacteria to the sand, where it survives and multiplies, forming a ready source of contamination later in the season, when wave action again can put it back in the water. New Composite Material Built to Repair Itself, Much Like Human Skin Material, heal thyself. Creation of polymer composites that can seal tiny cracks as they appear has long been a goal of chemists and engineers. Such materials could be useful in airplane wings, for example, which can develop cracks under the stress of flight. Scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are reporting progress toward that goal. Inspired by skin, a natural substance that is pretty good at healing itself, they have developed a material that can repair itself over and over. Nancy R. Sottos, a professor of materials science and engineering, said the current research built on earlier work on a system that uses microcapsules filled with a healing agent and embedded throughout the surface of the material. When a crack occurs, nearby capsules break and release the chemicals, which flow into the crack. The problem with that approach, Dr. Sottos said, is that once the capsules are used there is no more healing agent available. ''So if a crack were to occur in the same location, you couldn't reheal it,'' she said. The new system provides what amounts to a limitless source of healing agent through a three-dimensional network of channels that is analogous to the capillaries that supply blood to the skin. ''Instead of the capsules, it's this microvascular network that circulates and delivers the healing agent,'' Dr. Sottos said. When a crack occurs, the healing chemicals flow by capillary action to the crack. Embedded microcapsules are also used, but they contain a catalyst that hardens the healing agent. This catalyst is reusable, so if the area cracks again it can harden more healing agent that flows into the new crack. The researchers found the system was able to repair the same area up to seven times. Dr. Sottos, who is an author of a paper describing the work in Nature Materials, said the researchers were working on a system that would eliminate the microcapsules completely by using two or more independent microvascular networks to deliver repair chemicals. One difficulty, she said, is how to employ lots of tiny channels, which make the material more porous, and yet keep it strong. Nature does this quite easily with bone and other materials. ''The problem is how you do that synthetically,'' she said. OBSERVATORY"
"TO the naked eye, Surfrider Beach in Malibu, Calif., couldn't be lovelier: on a recent Friday, in 60-degree weather, the patch of the coastal mountains behind Malibu Pier was shrouded in morning fog. A flock of birds flew low over a sparse crowd of sunbathers, bobbing surfers and a lifeguard doing abdominals on a beach towel in front of his tower. But Eric Gross, a 28-year-old creative director at his family's graphic design studio who has been coming to Surfrider since childhood for its smooth, manicured wave, quickly shattered any postcard-quality impressions of this premier surfing beach. Take the stench emanating from the nearby lagoon, where Malibu Creek meets the sea, he noted. ''You see discoloration and big brown blobs, like in a sewer,'' Mr. Gross said of the days when the lagoon overflows and dumps untreated sewage on the waters he uses three to seven times a week. ''Sometimes the water just stinks. You wash off in the shower and you've got this smell on you all day.'' Then there's the taste. ''Have you ever tasted bong water by accident?'' he asked. ''It's just this muck.'' And the sore throats. ''Sometimes you don't know if you have a cold or you're sick from the water,'' Mr. Gross said. ''Who knows what the long term effects are.'' If Los Angeles County conjures images of a warm paradise of curled waves and palm trees, the locals know better. They live along a coast with the dubious distinction of having 7 of the state's 10 most polluted beaches, according to the latest report card from the environmental group Heal the Bay, which has given beaches like Surfrider a failing grade year after year. Many Southern Californians find contentment just looking at the ocean from their sun decks, grateful for their views and the clean air. But there are those who persist in braving the water, never mind the historic counts of bacteria from fecal matter and other sources that can cause skin rashes, ear infections and gastrointestinal ailments, or the signs that spell out the dangers with warnings like ''contact with ocean water at this location may increase risk of illness.'' So who are these people? Among the fearless: inlanders escaping the suffocating heat; tourists who don't know any better; and die-hard surfers who try to protect themselves by taking vitamins, by making sure their hepatitis and tetanus vaccinations are up to date, and by rinsing body cavities with hydrogen peroxide. ''You get all your shots, you stay away certain times,'' said Mr. Gross's father, Paul, 60, another longtime surfer who comes out three to four times a week. He matter-of-factly detailed his post-surf regimen: ''You take showers here and put hydrogen peroxide in your ears and gargle with hydrogen peroxide diluted with water.'' But many tourists come for the lifeguards, or at least settle for them. Gabriel Campos, a lifeguard for the last 35 summer seasons at the beach by the Santa Monica Municipal Pier, which is a perennial environmental underachiever, said the tourists want their pictures taken with a real-life model for ''Baywatch.'' ''I've done five shots with people today,'' said Mr. Campos, 52. Residents often don't bother with the water. Investigators studying beach attendance for the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Commission say the beaches of Santa Monica Bay -- a 60-mile stretch from Malibu south to the Palos Verdes Peninsula -- are drawing almost one million fewer visits each year, largely because of public apprehensions about the water. Water quality typically plummets when it rains, with contaminated runoff from the street and storm drain systems ending up in the ocean. This year's Heal the Bay report card, released on May 23, found that the state as a whole had above-average water quality because of a drought over the last year, but a dramatic drop in quality in the Long Beach area meant that Los Angeles County retained its status as the state's leading ''beach bummer.'' (Right before the Memorial Day weekend, about 5,000 gallons of sewage spilled into the waters off the Venice district of Los Angeles because of a blocked sewer line, prompting a two-day closure of several portions of two popular beaches.) THOSE craving a dip can easily drive to cleaner beaches. Sometimes the closest clean beach is less than a mile away, and 57 percent of Los Angeles County's beaches still score an ''A'' or ''B'' in dry weather. But many of the dirty beaches have their own storied appeal and social scenes. Last weekend, the beach by the Santa Monica Municipal Pier, which sits at the foot of luxury hotels and a bustling commercial district, was packed with the usual mix of tourists, cliques of young people and families, many of them working-class Latinos. ''I try not to swallow the water,'' said a 26-year-old accountant from Pasadena after taking a dip. The accountant, who adamantly refused to give his name, said he came to this beach to swim as often as twice a week in the summer because it was near restaurants and bars and he could ''tan and go party.'' ''It's a hub,'' he said. ''Obviously you want to go where there are people.'' But Jameel Chahal, 22, a friend in the accountant's group who was visiting from Canada, looked around almost in disgust. The water was brown and two dead sea lions had washed up, hardly an enticement to dip in as much as toe. (It was unclear what killed the animals, but a higher level of marine-mammal and seabird deaths this year has been linked to an increase in a naturally occurring toxin produced by algae.) ''I've never seen this color,'' Mr. Chahal said of the water. ''If you look out 100 meters, you don't see water that's clear. Why jump in the water when it's dirty like that?'' Many beachgoers come for everything but the water. Charlie and Lizette Figueroa said the temperature had reached 80 degrees by midmorning at their home in Ontario, 35 miles east of Los Angeles. They decided to pack up a cooler, shovels and buckets for their two children and drive one hour west to Santa Monica. On the beach, the children, ages 2 and 4, made a hole to bury their father while the couple sat on beach chairs fully dressed, enjoying the cool breeze. No one was getting wet. ''We're here just to relax and for the kids to play in the sand,'' said Mrs. Figueroa, 23, a supervisor for a bus company. ''My kids would rather go in the swimming pool. My son doesn't want to go in here. He says that the water looks dirty.'' Linwood Pendleton, a professor in the school of public health at the University of California, Los Angeles, who is the principal investigator on the study on beach attendance, said that Southern Californians have become unnecessarily fearful of the ocean. He said that the area does a better job at testing water quality than elsewhere in the country, so public awareness of the issue is high. ''People should look around at all the beaches and choose the ones with the lowest risk, but don't stay home,'' he said. ''The beach in Southern California is our Central Park, our open space.'' Mr. Pendleton is co-author of a study, released last year, that said as many as 1.5 million cases of sickness in Los Angeles and Orange Counties each year could be attributed to bacterial pollution in the ocean. Mr. Pendleton said that represented only a 1 percent chance of becoming sick. Even at the worst beaches, he said, the chance of becoming sick is relatively low, 5 to 15 percent. State and county officials say that this area has the most polluted beaches because it is the state's most populous region, noting that both development and people's behavior -- such as not cleaning up after their dogs -- contributed to the problem. The county also is among the first in the state to collect samples directly in front of storm drains and creeks, where the water quality is worse. But the officials said that cities are facing new requirements to limit bacteria at their beaches, and that $135 million in state bonds is going to cover the treatment of storm-related sewage problems at the worst sites. ''California is cleaning up its beaches,'' said William L. Rukeyser, a spokesman for the State Water Resources Control Board. Even Surfrider has been on a roll lately, with a string of passing grades in Heal the Bay's weekly report card. For surfers like Eric and Paul Gross, forgoing the beach they consider home base is not an option. ''No matter what the dangers are,'' the elder Mr. Gross said, ''this is still one of the best breaks.''"
"Though it contaminated groundwater and the Peconic River with toxic and radioactive chemicals, the Brookhaven National Laboratory became a model for reform four years ago when it began an aggressive cleanup campaign. Environmental advocates cheered the turnaround and even gave the lab an award last August. But now, a proposal that would extend the life of two of those cleanup efforts by four decades has angered environmentalists and residents near the lab. Where some of Brookhaven's other cleanups will last 30 years, the lab wants 70 years to filter radioactive strontium 90 from water just beneath the ground, and 65 years to extract volatile organic compounds from an aquifer. Scientists said the plan was less expensive and would put less strain on the surrounding community, and insisted there was no greater risk that dangerous chemicals would leach into people's drinking water. But at a public meeting here Tuesday night, environmentalists said the lab was sending the wrong message. ''The groundwater is a public resource,'' said Adrienne Esposito, an environmental activist. ''When a contamination occurs, we want it cleaned up.'' The question of how long the cleanups should last is only the latest to dog Brookhaven as it tries to exorcise a history of environmental problems and public mistrust. Contaminants from the lab leached into the ground over decades. ''They're doing the most in the worst possible circumstances,'' said Richard Amper, executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society, in an interview on Tuesday, ''but now they're proposing to do less than that. It sets a very bad precedent.'' The lab's proposal, to be completed in a month or two, is subject to approval by state regulators, the federal Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency. In a 2000 plan, Brookhaven said it would need 30 years to remove all the strontium 90 from a shallow plume that sits on the lab's property, 30 to 40 feet below the surface. Pumps would draw the water up from the soil and pump it through large tanks where resin filters would extract the radioactive strontium. But Mike Bebon, the lab's deputy director for operations, said subsequent studies showed that the water would have to be pumped from the ground at a rate that would exhaust the filters every two weeks. According to the lab's projections, filtering out the strontium in 30 years would cost $50 million, compared with about $9.4 million to do it in 70 years. Mr. Bebon said 70 percent of the material would be filtered out after 30 years. The plume will naturally creep toward the edge of the lab's property, but Mr. Bebon said that after 70 years, it would still be 1,400 feet from its border. To extract volatile organic compounds that have leached into a deeper reservoir, the Magothy Aquifer, the lab's scientists said they preferred a 65-year plan costing $2.3 million to a 30-year plan costing $15 million. The contamination of this aquifer extends beyond the lab's boundaries, and there are already wells set up to filter the water. Under the longer plan, scientists said, they would drill fewer wells near people's homes. After 30 years, Mr. Bebon said, 90 percent of the contaminants would be eliminated. Some members of the lab's community advisory council said they were ready to give the plans grudging support. ''You'd like it all cleaned up as quickly as possible as if money and time were of no consequence,'' said David Sprintzen, a member of the council. ''But you look at it and say, 'What is the likely danger?' I couldn't see any.'' Still, Ms. Esposito said before the meeting: ''We'll all be dead in 70 years. We want them to take responsibility for the cleanup and not leave it for the next two generations.'' Correction: January 14, 2005, Friday An article on Wednesday about a proposal to push back the completion date for two efforts to remove toxic chemicals from the groundwater surrounding the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island used an incorrect title in some copies for Richard Amper of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society, an environmental group that opposes the plan. He is executive director, not president."
"In an eagerly awaited report on perchlorate, one of the most controversial unregulated toxic pollutants in the country's drinking water and food supplies, the National Academy of Sciences said Monday that people would be safe if exposed to daily doses 20 times those under consideration by the Environmental Protection Agency. Depending on how federal and state regulators interpret the academy's recommendation, the Defense Department, its contractors and other federal agencies responsible for contamination from perchlorate, a component of solid rocket fuel, could avoid cleanup costs of hundreds of millions of dollars. The environmental agency and the states of California and Massachusetts have already taken the initial steps in the regulatory process, with the E.P.A. and Massachusetts both suggesting a maximum safe level of one part per billion, and California setting a goal of six parts per billion. Thus far, no regulation on the maximum safe level of perchlorate in drinking water has been made final. Large doses of the chemical, in widespread use by the Defense Department since the 1950's, have been shown to inhibit the thyroid gland's ability to take up iodide from a person's diet. Insufficient iodide has been linked with impaired neurological development, but the report said that the evidence the panel examined ''is inadequate to determine whether or not there is a causal association between perchlorate exposure and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children.'' The scientists on the National Academy panel avoided arriving at a figure for safe drinking water levels, saying that was not their charge, recommending instead a safe level based on body weight. Some state regulators and representatives of environmental groups, doing their own extrapolations from the panel's report, said it would support a drinking water standard of 20 parts per billion. Others said the conclusions could support maximum levels of less than three parts per billion. Pentagon scientists, using the same human studies that underpinned the academy's report, had concluded that the maximum safe level of perchlorate in drinking water supplies was 200 parts per billion. Groundwater around the country has been found to contain trace levels of perchlorate. The chemical has been detected in the Colorado River, a water source for 15 million people in the Southwest. The town of Bourne on Cape Cod closed some wells because of high perchlorate levels. But perchlorate's toxicity is hotly disputed, as are safe exposure levels. The debate led four federal agencies, including the Defense Department, to ask the academy to assess perchlorate's adverse health effects. In its report, the 15-member panel, led by Dr. Richard B. Johnston Jr. of the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said that risk assessments should be based on human studies that indicate when the thyroid's uptake of iodide is inhibited. The E.P.A.'s 2002 risk assessment had relied in part on studies of rats that indicated changes in some brain structures after perchlorate exposure. Scientists from environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Working Group pointed out that the main human study involved only seven healthy adults who ingested scaled amounts of perchlorate for 14 days. Regulators in both California and Massachusetts said Monday that they would review the report and, if necessary, adjust their preliminary findings on perchlorate. Allan Hirsch, a spokesman for the Office of Health and Hazard Assessment in California, said that changes might not be necessary, adding that the National Academy dose recommendation ''is highly consistent with the calculations we made.'' In an earlier call with reporters, officials of the Natural Resources group said that the evidence considered by the panel had been unfairly weighted on the side of industry and the Defense Department, which, along with the White House had an undue influence on the process. They cited evidence they obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, which showed extensive e-mail communication among high-ranking administration members about the charge given to the academy panel. Richard Canaday, a representative of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, responded in a telephone interview: ''There is no basis for that claim. This is an attempt to distort the science by attacking the process.'' The academy, Mr. Canaday added, is the ''gold standard of independent scientific review.''"
"Strontium-90, like most radioactive isotopes, is not something you want to brush your teeth with. It lurks in soil and groundwater and hides in bones and teeth, causing leukemia and other cancers. This is why so much attention has been paid to two large plumes of strontium-90 that are creeping very slowly through the soil under Brookhaven National Laboratory. The lab, like most everything else on Long Island, sits atop the aquifer that is the island's only natural source of drinking water. The radioactive contamination is one of several lingering stains from Brookhaven's nuclear reactors, now closed, and local officials and community activists have fought hard to get the Energy Department, which runs Brookhaven, to clean it up. It's slow work, given the nature of the contamination and the complicated, expensive means of removing it. And it may become slower still, because the Energy Department is asking for more time. It says that a project envisioned to last 30 years would be better off lasting 70. Why? Under an agreement it reached in 2000 with the Environmental Protection Agency and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, the lab has been operating an array of wells and pumps to remove tainted water, filter out the contaminants and return clean water to the ground. The trouble, project managers say, is that when tainted water flows through the filters too quickly, the filters become clogged with other minerals and impurities. They are changing filters far more often then they expected, and that's expensive. It would be far better, the lab says, to slow the flow, save millions of dollars on filters -- and more than double the time the project will take. The public health threat is negligible to begin with, they say, because no one is drinking Brookhaven water anyway, and a delay will not make things worse. And given strontium-90's relatively short half-life of 29 years, the problem is getting better on its own. We can accept these technical judgments by the folks at Brookhaven, just as we welcome their efforts to keep neighbors informed about the messes they have made. These involve not only leaks of strontium-90 but also of radioactive tritium and bothersome quantities of industrial chemicals that are another threat to groundwater. But we side with the well-informed environmental groups that have kept a close eye on Brookhaven's troubles for years. They are willing to accommodate the lab to a certain extent on the strontium-90 cleanup, accepting the judgment that it might make sense to extend the 30-year project by another decade or so. But they insist, rightly, that there is no good reason to prolong the project so drastically just because it is stickier than expected and the federal government does not want to spend the money. That could set a bad precedent for future cleanups at Brookhaven, which is going to be a dirty place for a long time. In 70 years, everyone arguing about this will probably be dead. That is too long to wait to restore the purity of a public resource as vital as Long Island's drinking water. Long Island"
"A federal judge ruled yesterday that major oil companies must defend dozens of lawsuits accusing them of fouling groundwater by using a gasoline additive that has become a political liability in the proposed energy bill. The ruling means that plaintiffs can proceed with some 80 lawsuits against oil companies asserting that the additive, methyl tertiary-butyl ether, or MTBE, fouled groundwater. The suits were brought by water providers, towns, counties and cities, including New York City and the state of New Hampshire. First filed in state courts, the suits were consolidated last year in federal court in New York. Yesterday, members of Congress debated an energy bill with legal protections for producers of the additive that would nullify most of the lawsuits. Opposition to the waiver in the Senate was a crucial reason the energy bill failed in 2o03. In yesterday's opinion, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District Court in Manhattan refused to dismiss most of the claims, saying: ''Innocent water providers -- and ultimately innocent water users -- should not be denied relief from the contamination of their water supply if defendants breached a duty to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm from their products.'' Judge Scheindlin did not rule on the merits of the cases, but she outlined a new theory of ''commingled product'' liability that would place more legal burden on the MTBE producers, which include Exxon Mobil and Lyondell Chemical. The suits assert that the oil companies contaminated wells and underground aquifers across the country by adding MTBE to gasoline as a way to reduce air pollution. They say the oil companies knew that MTBE would cause widespread contamination because the chemical does not readily cling to soil and moves faster and farther in the ground than other gasoline components. A spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil declined to comment, saying that the company had not had time to review the decision. Oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, have argued that the lawsuits are unfair and that those directly responsible for spills should be held liable, not the makers of the product. In her 193-page opinion, Judge Scheindlin said that MTBE suppliers should be liable for how much gasoline containing MTBE they provided to a given market, but that the burden was not on water system operators to account for every drop. Petroleum products, including gasoline, are generally commingled in pipelines with products from several companies before they are delivered to service stations or underground storage tanks. Stanley N. Alpert, a lawyer representing several water systems, said the opinion was significant. ''The fact that a water district cannot prove which oil company put the MTBE in its well will not prevent these plaintiffs from seeking justice,'' he said."
"Federal health officials should think carefully before issuing advisories recommending that women of childbearing age limit their intake of fish, new research suggests. The warnings are intended to protect fetuses from mercury, which concentrates in some fish and, at high enough levels, can damage the brains of the babies. But in a series of articles in the current American Journal of Preventive Medicine, researchers say the effect of the advisories may be detrimental to public health, since the fatty acids in fish help prevent serious problems like stroke and heart disease. There is also evidence that they help prenatal brains develop. ''These and other potential health effects yield a classic risk-risk trade-off,'' wrote the lead researcher, Joshua T. Cohen of the Harvard School of Public Health. Harvard researchers asked experts from a variety of universities to review the literature and decide whether the benefits of reducing mercury in pregnant women's diets was worth the loss of the fatty acids. ''I think we've got two messages,'' Dr. Cohen said. ''If you're not pregnant and you're not going to become pregnant, eat fish. If you are pregnant or you are going to become pregnant, you should still eat fish, but you should eat fish low in mercury.'' The problem with the government advisories, the researchers said, is that officials do not try to assess what effect they will have on the public. They are directed at women of childbearing age, but some experts believe they keep other people away from fish, too. And instead of avoiding just those fish high in mercury, like swordfish and king mackerel, some women avoid all fish. VITAL SIGNS: PUBLIC HEALTH Editors' Note: November 1, 2005, Tuesday A brief report in the Vital Signs column of Science Times last Tuesday summarized research in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine about federal advisories recommending that women of childbearing age limit their intake of fish. The research suggested that such warnings might do more harm than good, since the fatty acids in fish help prevent stroke and heart disease and may aid in prenatal brain development. The article should have noted that the research was financed by the National Food Processors Association Research Foundation and the Fisheries Scholarship Fund, two producer groups whose members include companies that sell fish."
"Tests of the floodwater that filled New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina show lower levels of toxic chemicals than had been feared, researchers reported yesterday. But they added that concern about the sediment remained. The researchers, from Louisiana State University, found that the water had high levels of bacteria but that concentrations of other contaminants like heavy metals and chemicals from gasoline were no worse than what typically washed down a New Orleans street after a hard rain. ''Our study shed some good news on that,'' said the lead researcher, John H. Pardue, director of the Louisiana Water Resources Research Institute at L.S.U. ''We were expecting to see much higher gasoline concentrations than what we saw.'' The results, the first to appear in a scientifically peer-reviewed publication, appear on the Web site of the journal Environmental Science and Technology (pubs.acs.org/journals/esthag/). In a separate but similar finding, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported yesterday that tests of fish, water and sediment collected in the Gulf of Mexico two weeks after the hurricane showed little sign of contamination by E. coli, bacteria associated with fecal contamination, or by pesticides and other chemicals. After the storm and the flood that followed it, widespread fears grew over what many people called a toxic gumbo, a wide array of dangerous substances washing from sewers, gasoline stations, factories, dry cleaners, chemical plants and oil refineries. Although the new findings seem to ease those concerns, there was wide agreement that it was still too early to issue a clean bill of health. ''Given the enormous amount of floodwater in New Orleans, it would be highly unlikely that any specific toxic chemical would be found in high concentrations due to the dilution factor,'' Rick Hind, legislative director for the Greenpeace Toxics Campaign, wrote in an e-mail message. ''What should now be tested is the mud, silt and groundwater in communities surrounding thousands of suspect facilities such as gas stations, fertilizer storage facilities, refineries and chemical plants.'' Dr. Pardue of L.S.U. agreed that residents returning to their homes should treat the sediment and sludge from the flooding as potentially hazardous, particularly for microbes that might cause disease. ''I certainly wouldn't take a family back,'' he said. ''There are still a number of unknowns.'' The L.S.U. researchers have also tested residues in the sediments. Dr. Pardue said those results were not ready. The new findings were consistent with earlier analyses by the Environmental Protection Agency. But the environmental agency's administrator, Stephen L. Johnson, noted that the E.P.A. had found high levels of some toxic metals in the sediment. ''We urge everyone to avoid contact with the sediment as well,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''We consider it dangerous.'' Beginning Sept. 3, five days after the hurricane struck, Dr. Pardue and his colleagues collected samples from 38 locations, focusing on neighborhoods near the 17th Street Canal, where a levee broke, and in the Mid-City district, close to the Superdome. High levels of copper and zinc in the floodwater, while posing little danger to people wading through it, ''well exceeded what is safe for marine life,'' Dr. Pardue said, and could pose a long-term danger to creatures in Lake Pontchartrain, where the water was pumped. STORM AND CRISIS: ENVIRONMENT"
"THE steady barrage of statistics trumpeting China's rise is often greeted elsewhere as if the figures were torpedoes and the rest of the world a sinking ship. Economic growth tops 9 percent! Textile exports jump 500 percent! Military spending up! Manufacturing up! The numbers inflame the exaggerated perception that China is methodically inhaling jobs and resources and, in the process, inhaling the rest of the planet. Burp. There goes the American furniture industry. Burp. Thanks for your oil, Venezuela. But one statistic offered last week by a top Chinese environmental official should stimulate genuine alarm inside and outside China. The official, Zhang Lijun, warned that pollution levels here could more than quadruple within 15 years if the country does not curb its rapid growth in energy consumption and automobile use. China, it seems, has reached a tipping point familiar to many developed countries, including the United States, that have raced headlong after economic development only to look up suddenly and see the environmental carnage. The difference with China, as is so often the case, is that the potential problems are much bigger, have happened much faster and could pose greater concerns for the entire world. ''I don't think it will jump four or five times,'' Robert Watson, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said of the pollution prediction by Mr. Zhang. ''But it could double or triple without too much trouble. And that's a scary thought, given how bad things are now.'' China is already the world's second-biggest producer of greenhouse gas emissions and is expected to surpass the United States as the biggest. Roughly a third of China is exposed to acid rain. A recent study by a Chinese research institute found that 400,000 people die prematurely every year in China from diseases linked to air pollution. Nor does China's air pollution respect borders: on certain days almost 25 percent of the particulate matter clotting the skies above Los Angeles can be traced to China, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Environmental experts in California predict that China could eventually account for roughly a third of the state's air pollution. The air problem could become a major embarrassment if, as some experts believe, Beijing does not meet its environmental targets for 2008, when the Olympic Games will be played here. For the Chinese government, the question is how to change the country's booming economy without crippling it. President Hu Jintao has made ''sustainable development'' a centerpiece of his effort to shift the country from unbridled growth to a more efficient economy. Mr. Hu and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao have repeatedly mentioned environmental protection in speeches. The political attention comes as environmental problems are begetting social and economic problems. Violent riots have erupted in the countryside over contaminated water, stunted crops and mounting health woes. In a handful of villages, farmers have stormed chemical factories to stop the dumping of filthy water. Roughly 70 percent of China's rivers and lakes are polluted. In cities, people drink bottled water; in the countryside, most people are too poor to pay for bottled water, so they boil polluted water or simply drink it. Public anger is also rising in cities. In some, air pollution is so thick that on the worst days doctors advise, impractically, against going outside. Last week, hundreds of people living in the Beijing outskirts protested plans for a factory they fear would inundate the neighborhood with pollution. The severity of the situation has created an opening for environmentalists in and out of the government. Environmentalism is a chic issue for college students, who have participated in garbage cleanups and joined the growing number of nongovernment organizations focused on pollution. The once-meek State Environmental Protection Administration, or SEPA, has become more aggressive in identifying and going after polluters and calling for reforms. But the political and practical obstacles are formidable. Car ownership has become part of the Chinese middle-class dream, and the car industry has become a major contributor to tax coffers and a force in the overall economy. Industrial pollution is difficult to control because local officials often ignore emissions standards to appease polluting factories that pay local taxes. SEPA has closed factories, only to see them reopen weeks later. To make a serious reduction in air pollution, experts say, tougher, enforceable standards are needed, and many factories would need new pollution control equipment. ''There has to be the political will,'' said Steve Page, director of the E.P.A office of air quality planning and standards. ''The challenge they face is how will these plants be lined up and told this will happen?'' Politically, the Communist Party has based its legitimacy on delivering economic growth and understands that the boom cannot be taken for granted: high growth is needed simply to keep unemployment in check, and top leaders fear that a slowdown could lead to social instability. Local officials are promoted, foremost, for delivering economic growth. This is why environmental officials have pushed for a new ''green G.D.P.,'' which would alter how gross domestic product is calculated to reflect losses inflicted by environmental degradation. The party is suspicious of environmental groups because of the role similar groups played in promoting grass-roots democracy in the ''color'' revolutions of central Asia. Human Rights Watch reported that some environmentalists were recently arrested. But if there is resistance, there is progress, too. A law taking effect next year will require that China produce 10 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. Fuel efficiency standards for new cars are already stricter than those in the United States. At an air pollution conference last Monday, environmental officials solicited advice from their peers in Europe and the United States. Mr. Page, the E.P.A. official, praised Chinese officials and said China is considering the sort of regional pollution abatement strategies used in the United States. ''They are wrestling with a lot of the same pollution problems that we wrestled with several years ago and that, to some extent, we still are grappling with,'' said Mr. Page, who attended the conference. Ma Jun, an independent environmentalist based in Beijing, also praised the efforts by SEPA. Mr. Ma said China's status as the ''workshop of the world'' made it inevitable that its share of the world's pollution would increase. But he also cautioned that too many government ministries remained consumed by economic development. He said the government also needed to recognize the ''environmental rights'' of citizens. ''The pollution problem,'' he said, ''is very serious.'' THE WORLD"
"A toxic 50-mile band of contaminated river water slowly washed through this frigid provincial capital on Friday, leaving schools and many businesses closed, forcing millions of people to spend a third straight day without running water and raising fears of a long-term environmental disaster. Yet a local newspaper seemed just as concerned about a disaster that did not happen. ''There Will Not Be an Earthquake in Harbin,'' promised a large front-page headline in The Modern Evening Times. The strange headline, coming as nationwide attention in China is focused on the dangerous benzene and nitrobenzene spill that contaminated the local Songhua River, seemed to have been a misprint. But, instead, it was an effort to dispel the wild rumors that mushroomed after Monday, when city officials pointedly did not mention the spill of the liquid chemicals in their initial public notice shutting down the municipal water system. The city tried to convince the public that a shutdown was necessary to conduct routine repairs on the pipes. Suspicions instantly erupted. There had already been an inexplicable rash of rumors that the government had detected signs of an earthquake. Now those rumors escalated, and enough people panicked that officials had to confirm the spill, but the public relations damage was already done. It seems that in their efforts to hide a chemical spill, Harbin officials may have helped fuel unfounded fears of an earthquake. The provincial earthquake bureau has since issued a reassuring statement that no temblors are predicted. ''They were trying to lie and get by,'' Qi Guangzhong, 64, said as he walked on a promenade beside the brown waters of the Songhua on Friday. ''The government wanted to hide this.'' The earthquake rumors, if bizarre, are just one of the consequences of a government response that appeared secretive and misleading at a time when China is eager to prove to the outside world that it is a candid international partner on issues like containing avian influenza. In the Chinese news media and on the Internet, public anger seethed this week over the spill, in which an estimated 100 tons of benzene and nitrobenzene poured into the river after an explosion at the state-owned Jilin Petrochemical Company in Jilin City, 236 miles upstream from Harbin. One citizen has already sued the state-owned company responsible for the spill, seeking a symbolic $2 and a public apology, state news media reported. The public dissatisfaction came as the central government on Friday sent an inspection team, including disciplinary officials, to investigate the spill and its aftermath in Harbin. ''The presence of disciplinary officials in the team indicates punishments of irresponsible acts are on the way,'' the official New China News Agency reported. At the same time, teams of environmental officials began gauging the potential damage on the Songhua as signs appeared that the immediate crisis was easing. Readings taken from the river showed that the toxicity of the water was steadily declining as inflows of water and the progression of the spill diluted the toxicity. On the streets of Harbin, life seemed normal, if somewhat surreal, given that a major metropolitan area of several million people had almost no running water or usable toilets and that thousands of residents seemed to have fled. But the public anxiety from earlier in the week eased noticeably after the arrival of truckloads of bottled water to prevent shortages in drinking supplies. City officials, reacting to initial reports of price gouging, put a freeze on water prices. At several corner markets, boxes of water were stacked high outside. On one street, a crowd of people stood around a fire truck, waiting for water. ''We're not worried,'' said a teenager playing on a swing set at a playground near the river. Harbin officials have said the water system could be restored as soon as Saturday, when the slick of polluted water is expected to move past the city on its slowly moving path through northeastern China toward Russia. But it seemed more likely that the system would remain shut down for several days as officials determine the potential environmental and public health risks. The river supplies more than 80 percent of Harbin's public water supply. Scientists in China have already warned of potentially dangerous long-term hazards as the benzene seeps into the soil near the riverbed or is ingested by fish and other marine life. The chemical factory, a subsidiary of state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, the country's largest oil company, produces benzene, a colorless liquid derived from petroleum. Drinking liquids with high levels of benzene can cause illness or even death. Benzene is also considered a carcinogen, and is linked particularly to a variety of leukemia and lymphoma. Ma Jun, an environmentalist in Beijing and author of ''China's Water Crisis,'' said the chemical spill had exposed enormous potential problems that existed all across China after decades of rampant industrial development. In fact, one person was killed Friday in an explosion at another chemical plant, in Sichuan Province. ''We're in the process of quadrupling our economy,'' Mr. Ma said. ''The risks are also growing. Pollution discharges are rising. We need to face the reality that we are becoming a society at risk.'' Mr. Ma also blamed the chemical plant for initially denying the spill. ''Instead of informing the downstream cities and communities that they were in the path of danger, it just kept denying the toxic spill,'' he said. ''This denial is not acceptable.'' Chinese health officials were sharply criticized for covering up the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which originated in southern China in November 2002 but was not acknowledged by the authorities for several months, and then only after it had spread to Hong Kong and Beijing. Since then, the government has earned growing praise from international health officials for being more open and responsive about public health outbreaks, like avian influenza. Lately, however, scientists have begun to question the low number of bird flu infections listed in China, which has reported only three, compared with 91 in Vietnam, with less than a tenth the population. On Friday, the roles played by different government agencies in the chemical spill began to emerge in a flurry of articles published in the Chinese media. The different accounts, including some from the official New China News Agency, suggest that officials in Jilin and Harbin had initially sought to prevent news of the explosion from reaching the public. After the explosion that caused the spill, factory officials initially announced that the accident posed no threat of air pollution. Officials also denied at that time that any benzene had spilled into the Songhua. Apparently, government officials in Jilin also initially denied the chemical spill to their downstream neighbors in Heilongjiang Province, home of Harbin. But Jilin officials finally told their peers in Heilongjiang on Nov. 19, according to a Shanghai newspaper, The News Morning Post. Meanwhile, China Youth Daily reported that local environmental officials in Jilin had first sought to dilute the spill by dumping reservoir water into the Songhua, rather than telling the public. By Monday, officials in Harbin were preparing to announce the shutdown of the water supply but feared news of the chemical spill would incite a public panic, according to The News Morning Post. So they made the announcement about the maintenance work on the pipes. In serious accidents like this one, provincial and local officials oftenwait for cues from the central government in Beijing on how to respond publicly. It is unclear if top leaders played a role in the official subterfuge about the spill. Some unconfirmed reports said Prime Minister Wen Jiabao eventually ordered disclosure of the problem in Harbin. The official English-language newspaper, China Daily, published an unusually blunt commentary that singled out the chemical company for criticism. ''We do not know what is behind the cover-up,'' the commentary stated. ''It might be because they were afraid that they would have to pay money for the losses the pollution has incurred in Harbin, and it might be because they were afraid of losing face. ''But the fact is they have brought shame on themselves by covering up the truth.'' The China Daily commentary portrayed Harbin officials as innocent victims who had responded effectively to the crisis. But many Harbin residents were immediately suspicious when city officials announced that the water would be stopped for maintenance work. Mr. Qi, the man walking along the river, said the timing was too strange: Why would the city do routine work when the subzero temperatures of winter are about to begin? Standing beside the river, Mr. Qi said he had first learned of the explosion by watching a Shanghai television station. ''People are angry,'' he said. ''The consequences could have been grave if people had started drinking the water and dying.'' Then, he gazed at the brown, partly frozen waters. ''It looks the same today, maybe even a little better,'' Mr. Qi said. ''The pollution is always heavy in the river.''"
"THE flood was not of biblical proportions, but on that September night nearly six years ago, workers at the Yorktown Heights Water Pollution Control Plant could be forgiven for wondering if God was a little angry with them. It was the night Tropical Storm Floyd bore down so furiously on the region, and the defenders of the aging sewage treatment plant, situated in a flood plain, could do little to deflect the assault. Within hours, hundreds of thousands of gallons of raw and partly treated sewage had been washed into nearby Hallock's Mill Brook -- part of the region's watershed, which nine million residents of New York City and Westchester, Putnam, Orange and Ulster Counties rely on for drinking water. ''Everything happened too fast,'' said Edward Mahoney, assistant superintendent of the plant. The flood strengthened resolve in white, wealthy Yorktown to scrap the long-troubled plant and divert local sewage away from the watershed, pumping it seven miles west to a facility in multiethnic, blue-collar Peekskill. There it would be treated, dumped into the Hudson River and carried out to the Atlantic Ocean -- rather than back into the drinking-water supply, which many experts consider vulnerable to contamination, even by thoroughly treated sewage effluent. The plan seemed simple enough, and in 2002 the New York City Department of Environmental Protection agreed to earmark millions of dollars for the so-called ''sewage diversion'' project. With County Executive Andrew J. Spano also expressing support, the project seemed destined to win approval from the county board of legislators. Three years later, its prospects seem bleak. Stalled by charges of environmental racism and beset by political infighting, it has not generated much action either by the governor's office or in New York City's environmental circles, even though water quality is at stake. Yorktown, meanwhile, remains reliant on an ever-creakier treatment plant, and the federal Environmental Protection Agency, concerned about persistent problems at the plant, has urged bickering local officials either to proceed with diversion or spend millions on an upgrade. Among those being urged to act is Linda G. Cooper, Yorktown's supervisor. She supports the diversion plan and is fighting for its future. ''One never says never,'' she said, ''but this could be it.'' The Yorktown facility is one of more than 100 treatment plants in the watershed, a 1,972-square-mile network of rivers, reservoirs and aqueducts that extends 125 miles north and west of the city. On a normal day, when the plants are not battling otherworldly storms and raw-sewage overflows, they are treating waste and dropping the effluent into the watershed. But the Environmental Protection Agency says even treated waste can generate trace amounts of suspected carcinogens and encourage outbreaks of waterborne diseases like giardiasis or cryptosporidiosis. In addition, new research by scientists in the United States and Britain is raising questions about the impacts of long-term exposure to pharmaceuticals, insect repellent and other products that make their way into human waste, flow into sewage treatment plants and wind up in the water supply in trace quantities. Some scientists have cautioned against overplaying these threats. Runoff from streets and parking lots poses a bigger challenge than sewage treatment plants, they argue, and it would not make sense to raise serious alarms about the impacts of tiny amounts of Prozac or bug spray when so little is known. But experts starting with New York City's watershed inspector general, James M. Tierney, have argued for years that removing treated waste from the water supply is good public policy. And the top priority, all along, has been getting rid of the Yorktown plant, the largest and most troubled in the region. DREW CLAXTON, a Peekskill Democratic councilwoman with political ambitions, has done what she can to thwart that effort. An economist and statistician reared by a white mother and black stepfather at the height of the civil rights movement, she says she is acutely attuned to the impact of racism, both overt and subtle. In a recent interview, Ms. Claxton, 49, put the diversion proposal in the second category. Adding at least 1.5 million gallons of waste a day to a sewage treatment plant that already generates odor complaints may not be part of a racist plot, she said, but it certainly has a discriminatory impact on the city. In 2000 Ms. Claxton founded a citizens group opposing the plan and reached out to environmental groups across the county. Some, like Riverkeeper, leaned toward diversion, concerned about the presence of treated waste in the water supply. But critics like the Sierra Club noted that treatment plants in the watershed area have sharp limits on growth, which effectively discourages development of high-density buildings like malls and condominiums. Scrapping a plant and diverting sewage out of the watershed, they argued, would simply open the door to sprawl. Officials promised to place caps on growth, but environmentalists saidpoliticians or lawsuit-happy developers could undo any curbs in the future. Ms. Claxton also won support from N.A.A.C.P. representatives in Peekskill and in Yonkers, which was resisting a more modest plan to handle sewage from affluent New Castle. And when Suzannah Glidden, a New York environmentalist, reached out to Julian Bond, an old high school classmate who is chairman of the N.A.A.C.P.'s national board of directors, the movement to halt diversion finally achieved critical mass. ''It just seemed to be a kind of classic environmental tragedy,'' said Mr. Bond in a recent telephone interview. ''These things happen all over the country. You've got something you don't want -- put it in the black people's neighborhood.'' By 2001, Ms. Claxton was starting a second bid, this one successful, for a Peekskill City Council seat. Activists on both sides of the issue agree that the diversion plan focused her campaign, bringing racial-justice concerns to the fore and playing a role in stalling the project. Ms. Claxton's allies find much to celebrate in that, while supporters of diversion take a more cynical view. They say the charges of environmental racism that gained currency at the time are unfair, given that effluent from the Yorktown plant currently flows into a portion of the watershed serving 186,000 Westchester residents, some of them black and Hispanic, and hundreds of thousands of low-income minority residents of Manhattan and the Bronx. But they do not limit their critique to Ms. Claxton and her Democratic allies. They also say Peekskill Republicans have turned up the volume on their opposition to the plan, so as not to be outflanked by the Democrats. Larry Schwartz, a Democrat who is deputy county executive, says George Oros, the Republican legislator representing Peekskill, was willing to cut a deal before diversion became a cause célèbre, asking in early 2000 for $5.1 million in sewer projects in Peekskill in exchange for agreeing to accept diversion from Yorktown. An April 14, 2000, memorandum from Mr. Schwartz to several other county officials lends credence to this account. In it Mr. Schwartz urges several county officials to ''review the 'shopping list' that was submitted to me by George Oros in order to get Peekskill's cooperation'' on diversion and itemizes 11 local projects he wanted money for. Mr. Oros says he recalls no such list and suggests that if there were any deal on the table, it was proposed by Mr. Schwartz in an effort to buy off local leaders. Like many Peekskill-area Republicans, Mr. Oros says he has always firmly opposed diversion because it would eat up precious capacity at the Peekskill plant and curb growth in a city trying to emerge from years of economic depression. By early 2003, the campaign against diversion was in full stride. And when the county held a series of public hearings on the proposal, residents of Peekskill and Yonkers packed the meetings to voice their opposition. That spring, Mr. Oros and a group of black county legislators opposed to diversion were able to block a vote on the environmental review required to move the project forward. ALARMED at the developments in Westchester and convinced that diversion was vital to water quality, Christopher O. Ward, then commissioner of New York City's Department of Environmental Protection, reached out to Gov. George E. Pataki, a former Peekskill mayor, and the state's Department of Environmental Conservation to ask for help brokering a deal, according to current and former city employees and Ms. Cooper, the Yorktown supervisor. But a conservation department spokeswoman, Maureen Wren, said in a recent interview that the state was eager for local officials to deal with the Yorktown plant's problems, which include excess ammonia and copper in effluent. The method -- diversion or upgrading -- is strictly up to them, she added. Michael Kaplowitz, a Democratic county legislator representing Yorktown, Somers and New Castle and a leading proponent of diversion, sees the matter as more than a local concern. With the safety of the region's water supply hanging in the balance, he said, the governor's failure to intervene in his own backyard has been a major disappointment. ''It makes us wonder where the leadership is at the top,'' he said. Eileen Burke knows as well as anyone the agony of the plan's slow decline. Ms. Burke, 43, a homemaker, and her husband, Michael, own one of the thousand or so Yorktown homes that have been forced to remain on septic systems, many of them old and leaching sewage into the watershed, while the diversion debate drags on. Strict watershed regulations forbid new hookups to the overworked Yorktown sewage plant; the Burkes can only hope diversion becomes a reality, so they can install a sewer system. In the meantime, they say, they have sunk $14,000 into septic system repairs over the last 11 years, worrying constantly that smelly, soggy patches in the yard may ruin family events and pose health risks for their three children. ''Every penny we put into the ground is a hardship and every flush of the toilet is a hardship,'' said Mrs. Burke, standing in her backyard on a recent afternoon. Pressure from her and others has kept Yorktown politicians like Linda Cooper in pursuit of diversion, and today they are taking a new tack. Ms. Cooper says the town is working with the state to commission a study that will lay out, in great detail, both the plant upgrade and diversion options. She expressed hope that the study would make the definitive case for diversion. Some of the likeminded add, privately, that they are setting aside the smaller New Castle-to-Yonkers diversion proposal in the hope of winning support from Yonkers politicians who have been implacable foes of diversion in the past. But to break the impasse, diversion proponents may need help from New York City elected officials and environmentalists who so far have paid the issue little attention. James F. Gennaro, the New York City councilman who heads the committee on environmental protection, says he has always supported diversion but has had a hard time getting his colleagues interested. He adds that he has recently been working to persuade Adolfo Carrión Jr., the Bronx borough president, that city leaders should throw more political weight behind the project. But whatever they decide, if history is any indicator, New York City and Westchester residents could still be wondering for years what, exactly, is in their water. The Pall in Peekskill PEEKSKILL WHEN Thomas Tinsley drives home on a warm summer evening, he does not anticipate the smell of freshly baked bread or mowed grass. Mr. Tinsley, 71, a retired food worker who lives in the Dunbar Heights public housing complex here, waits for something not quite as pleasant to reach his nose: the stench wafting from the Peekskill Wastewater Treatment Plant nearby. ''You're driving in and the first thing you get is that odor,'' he said, seated on his couch on a recent afternoon. ''You don't want that stuff in your car.'' Mr. Tinsley, who has lived at Dunbar Heights for 43 years, said residents had been coping with odors off and on for as long as he could remember, closing windows or cutting barbecues short to avoid the smell. And, like most tenants, he is unhappy about plans to pump in an additional 1.5 million gallons of waste per day, or more, from Yorktown. That concern has pushed a handful of residents to protest the plan -- but just a handful. ''I think they're intimidated or too busy with their lives,'' said John Gilleo, 47, president of the Dunbar Heights Tenants Association. ''You figure, you're low-income, they're not going to listen to us.'' Westchester officials say they are listening to the Dunbar Heights tenants and other neighbors. Having sunk $2 million into odor-abatement projects thus far, officials are proposing $13.5 million more in plant improvements, including odor-control elements like tank covers, said Adam J. Zabinski, first deputy commissioner of the county's department of environmental facilities. But at this point, most tenants say they are resigned to the lingering smells. ''I still do what I've got to do,'' said Leonard Holliman, 44, a bus driver who lives in Dunbar Heights with his wife and two of his children. ''It doesn't affect my life.''

"The states of New York and Connecticut do not always see eye to eye when it comes to managing the waters they share in Long Island Sound. But the two states, along with federal environmental officials and the United States Army Corps of Engineers, found common ground yesterday and agreed to strictly limit, and eventually eliminate, the dumping of dredged material in the Sound. The agreement replaces a plan announced last year by the federal Environmental Protection Agency that would have allowed up to 20 million cubic yards of sediment from the bottom of harbors and rivers -- some of it contaminated -- to be dumped into the open waters of the Sound over the next 20 years. Thousands of residents in New York and Connecticut objected to the proposal, pointing out that dredge disposal would threaten the cleanup of Long Island Sound, which has already cost New York $340 million. ''We said, 'No, you're not going to do that,''' said Adrienne Esposito, the executive director of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, in Farmingdale, on Long Island, which helped to rally opposition to the plan and get elected officials in both states to seek an alternative. ''This is perfect because it forced the E.P.A. and Connecticut to stop using Long Island Sound as a permanent dumping ground.'' The agreement scuttles the long-term dumping plan. In its place will be a severely limited disposal schedule and a commitment to develop a regional plan for managing dredge material that was outlined in legislation introduced by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Tim Bishop of Southampton last year. At first, dumping will be limited to two designated sites in the western and central sections of the Sound. The use of those sites will be limited to three projects that already have dumping permits, and for no more than three years. Those dredge projects include one in Norwalk, Conn., and one each in New Rochelle and Rye, N.Y. Decisions about future projects will be made by a team of state and federal experts who will first look for treatment options and disposal on land. But if practical alternatives cannot be found, a provision of the agreement allows the two designated disposal sites to continue to be used. Robert W. Varney, regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, said that testing would continue to ensure that highly contaminated dredge material was not dumped into the Sound. ''Working with our partners, we will ensure that dredged sediment is managed in the best and most appropriate manner, so that ecological health won't be compromised,'' Mr. Varney said in a statement released by his office. Gov. George E. Pataki flew to a park in Bayville, on Long Island, to announce the agreement, which he called ''a great victory of all of the communities located on Long Island Sound.'' Opponents concede that dredge disposal may continue for some time, but they feel they have won an important victory. ''This begins a constructive, thoughtful process of elimination,'' Ms. Esposito said, ''and that is a tremendous amount of progress in one year.''"
"SINCE tube wells became popular as a source of drinking water in Bangladesh in the 1970's, tens of millions of people have been slowly poisoned by arsenic. Exposure to arsenic from the contaminated wells is projected to double the number of cancer deaths in Bangladesh in the next two to three decades. Potential solutions to the crisis have received less attention than the problem. It is time to plan a course of action that takes into account the current reliance on tube wells since a wholesale rejection of their use in Bangladesh isn't realistic at this time. For now, we should focus on a feasible strategy that is relatively inexpensive yet can greatly improve the lives of millions of Bangladeshis. More than 10 million tube wells have been installed in Bangladesh since aid organizations started promoting groundwater as a safer alternative to polluted stream or pond water that exposed consumers to potentially life-threatening illnesses like diarrheal diseases. The vast majority of these wells are privately owned, demonstrating that Bangladeshi families have been willing to spend several months of income on a reliable, nearby source of water that is not contaminated by human or animal waste. The data already is available to make the best possible use of those aquifers that are low in arsenic instead. This option is preferable to ones that are more costly, require more maintenance or are vulnerable to contamination. In a program sponsored by the World Bank, Unicef and other organizations, nearly five million wells in the most affected half of the country have been tested for arsenic. Approximately one-third of the tested wells are considered unsafe; but thankfully, in many villages unsafe wells are near a safe well. Follow-up surveys have shown that about one-third of the households with an unsafe well were able to switch to a neighboring safe well in response to test results. What can be done to provide safe water to the remaining 12 million people who continue to rely on their poisoned wells for drinking and cooking? It turns out that safe groundwater is reachable in most villages of Bangladesh. The information available from the testing program can distinguish those villages where local drilling teams can manually install a safe community well from those where a mechanized rig with the ability to go deeper will have to be called in. For the villages that do not already have enough safe wells that can be shared, the installation of roughly 50,000 community wells could alleviate much of the problem at a cost of approximately $50 million. The community-based structure of the large, successful nongovernmental organizations operating in Bangladesh is well suited to directing the installation of community wells by local teams of drillers, while a centralized government program may be needed for installing deeper wells. An equally important task that could be taken on primarily by nongovernmental organizations is the establishment of a countrywide, permanent well-testing service available at the village level. A small fraction of safe wells will become tainted over time, not because an entire aquifer becomes contaminated but because shallow groundwater with elevated arsenic levels can enter through faulty connections between a well's plastic pipes. The cost of testing -- about 50 cents per test -- could be paid for by communities and households. This plan does not rule out other options, including surface water treatment, removing arsenic from groundwater, shallow dug wells, or piped-water systems that could play an important role in the long term. Ideally, Bangladeshi villagers will one day also have access to safe water from a tap at home. In the meantime, a safe, regularly tested community well in the center of each affected village provides the best chance of addressing the problem quickly throughout the country. Op-Ed Contributors Alexander van Geen, a senior research scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia; Kazi Matin Ahmed, a geology professor at the University of Dhaka; and Joseph H. Graziano, an associate dean at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia, head a research program on arsenic in the United States and Bangladesh."
"The forecast, courtesy of the United Nations, is grim. Today, more than a billion people lack access to safe drinking water. Polluted water contributes, each year, to the death of about 15 million children under age 5. By midcentury, between two billion and seven billion people will face water shortages. ''No region will be spared from the impact of this crisis,'' Koichiro Matsuura, director general of Unesco, recently warned. ''Water supplies are falling while the demand is dramatically growing.'' He estimated that in the next two decades the average amount of water available per person on the planet will shrink by a third. But the United Nations is also working hard on solutions, helping poor countries learn a subtle art that lets them better manage their water resources to avoid tragedy. The method is known as isotope hydrology. Cheap and reliable, it takes advantage of the fact that water molecules carry unique fingerprints, based in part on differing proportions of the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes that constitute all water. Isotopes are forms of the same element that have variable numbers of neutrons in their nuclei. Using the tools of isotope hydrology, scientists can discover the age, origins, size, flow and fate of a water source. And that information, in turn, can guide sound water-use policy, letting water engineers better map underground aquifers, conserve supplies and control pollution. For instance, if the method reveals that the water in a well is young and recently derived from rain, villagers can pump away vigorously. But if it turns out to be very old -- what scientists call fossil water -- they need to move gingerly, taking care not to exhaust the water supply. ''You take it out once, like oil,'' Werner Burkart, head of the nuclear science programs of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in an interview. The United Nations group, best known for fighting the spread of nuclear arms, is leading the hydrology effort. Based in Vienna, it works at developing techniques as well as sharing them with scientists around the world. ''We do a lot of capability building and training of local people, so it becomes sustainable -- so we don't have to inject support all the time,'' said Ana María Cetto, the agency's head of technical cooperation. ''They're building their own capacity to manage their own resources.'' A little money goes a long way. Each year, the isotope hydrology program spends only about $2 million on research and $5 million to aid developing states. Still, that is enough to finance 84 projects in more than 50 countries, including Bangladesh, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Morocco and Senegal. ''If you look at the Middle East, everywhere you are using old water,'' said Pradeep Aggarwal, the head of the agency's isotope hydrology unit. ''It was laid down 10,000, maybe 100,000 years ago. So you have to understand there's a limit to how long this will go.'' After more than 25 years of cooperative work, the agency has gathered so much information that it is now fashioning a detailed portrait of the planet's water resources that could help prevent future crises and reduce regional friction that may erupt in water wars. ''We're talking about food security, sustainable development,'' Dr. Aggarwal said. ''If it's based on unsustainable water resources, you jeopardize everything.'' Oceans and seas constitute 97 percent of the planet's waters. The remaining 3 percent is fresh water, most locked up as ice, soil moisture and deep groundwater. What is available to people -- mainly as rivers, lakes, aquifers, reservoirs and wetlands -- comes down to less than 1 percent. Using that fresh water wisely requires considerable knowledge of the earth's water cycle, the outlines of which are well known, centering on evaporation and rain, runoff and seepage. But local riddles abound. The puzzles can include how often a particular body of water is renewed, where it flows and whether different bodies are physically linked through underground flows. In the past, water engineers would address such unknowns by carefully measuring rain and the levels of rivers and other bodies of water for many decades -- typically a half-century or more. It usually took that long to learn the subtleties of the local cycles. However, isotope hydrology can do it in days, quickly illuminating water's passage through the depths. ''You really need to know how the water gets in and moves,'' said Dr. Aggarwal. ''Isotopics let you do that in a cost-effective way.'' The raw material is everywhere. Air, soil and water naturally contain oxygen in two forms -- oxygen 16 and oxygen 18, which has two extra neutrons in its nucleus. Oxygen 18 represents about 1 oxygen atom in every 500. Because it is heavier than oxygen 16, more is left behind when water evaporates. As a result, seawater is rich in oxygen 18; rain and snow are relatively poor, and increasingly so the further inland they fall. These gradients are echoed underground. The tools of isotope hydrology let scientists see the differences, creating a window into the depths. For instance, comparing samples from different wells can reveal whether the groundwater mixes or becomes isolated in separate pools. In Ethiopia, the International Atomic Energy Agency used such techniques to help a foundering project. To supply water to the capital, Addis Ababa, the Ethiopians drilled 25 large wells, assuming that a not-too-distant river would renew the aquifer. But when the pumping started, water levels fell much faster than predicted. ''They didn't understand the hydrology,'' Dr. Aggarwal recalled. ''They came to us for help.'' In a two-day survey, the agency discovered little connection between the river and the wells, prompting an overhaul of the project that put new emphasis on judicious use. Scientists have now mapped the speed and direction of the area's limited groundwater flow. Ethiopia's reaction to the episode was to demand that its water scientists put greater emphasis on isotope hydrology, making it ''a standard tool for the country,'' said Mohamed ElBaradei, the agency's director general. Over continents and wide lands, the study of isotope signatures can reveal if aquifers flow under national borders, helping neighbors collaborate on the intelligent use of scarce water. That is just what the atomic energy agency is doing in the blistering heat of the Eastern Sahara desert, with Libya, Chad, Egypt and Sudan. They have joined together to map the shared water resources of the Nubian aquifer, a vast subterranean body whose lobes range over nearly a million square miles, an area bigger than Iran and Iraq combined. ''We're trying to elucidate the connections,'' said Mokdad Maksoudi, an expert on African technical cooperation at the agency. ''Some parts of the aquifer are very old, with fossil water. Some are recharged through the Nile. ''We're trying to understand the recharge, so the countries can precisely gauge the best policies,'' he said. The stakes are high because areas of fossil water are vulnerable to quick depletion. A main goal of isotope hydrology is to discover the age of groundwater, defined as the last time it had contact with the atmosphere. This is calculated in many ways. Cool temperatures, for example, lower the concentrations of oxygen 18, and thus, unusually low amounts of the atom in groundwater imply that the body of water arose long ago, during ice ages and cooler climatic eras. A more exact way to determine age is to measure carbon 14, a radioactive isotope that water bears in minute quantities and that, with clocklike precision, steadily decays into other substances, allowing researchers to calculate the elapsed time. Scientists have used such methods to address a humanitarian crisis in Bangladesh that the World Health Organization calls the ''largest mass poisoning of a population in history.'' Millions of people in Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, drink arsenic-contaminated water, the poison gradually debilitating its victims before spawning cancers that kill them. Good intentions lay behind this horror. For decades, the government and aid groups had urged people to give up pond water, often a carrier of lethal disease, and instead to dig shallow wells. But no one tested the aquifers for arsenic. For years, the atomic energy agency and its isotope hydrologists, using the carbon 14 and oxygen 18 methods, have worked closely with the Bangladeshis to help them map aquifer mazes and identify safer water supplies. The news is mixed. The scientists have found that the arsenic tends to reside in shallow aquifers, and that deeper levels bear none of the deadly poison. In some cases, however, these deep aquifers have connections to the shallower ones, and pumping them out could draw in the contaminated water. ''So you can have water at 100 meters that is arsenic-free today, but could become polluted in the future,'' Dr. Aggarwal said. He added that the teams have discovered even deeper waters that are unconnected to the surface and will probably stay pure. But the isotope-dating methods show that these very deep aquifers are old and not undergoing renewal, calling for careful conservation. ''If you pump it out in a major way,'' he said, ''it will hurt.'' The flow of detailed hydrological information, he said, has been ''a tremendous boost'' to the government's understanding and has helped it make substantial changes in policy. ''Part of solving the problem,'' Dr. Aggarwal said, ''is to understand its origin and extent.'' Experts agree that hydrology will become even more important in the future, as growing water shortages intensify conflicts between states, whether or not they result in water wars. Some analysts see clean water as poised to supplant oil as the world's most contested natural resource. Dr. Burkart of the atomic energy agency said that reliable information about the hidden world of water could only help dissipate international tensions. ''The more you know,'' he said, ''the better.''"
"On a red-dirt road in the Baviaanskloof Nature Reserve in South Africa, Mike Powell suddenly hit the brakes and jabbed a finger in the direction of an innocuous-looking clump of pink flowers. ''That is an alien,'' he said. ''All these aliens are going ballistic.'' Baviaanskloof means Valley of the Baboons in Afrikaans, but Mr. Powell, program manager for a government project called Working for Woodlands, was not reaching for a pun on ''Planet of the Apes.'' ''It is called mother of millions,'' he said of the flower. ''It's an invasive succulent from Madagascar.'' Alien invasive plants are a serious concern in South Africa, displacing native vegetation and sucking up water needed by humans. They are one of many environmental problems that have prompted programs like Mr. Powell's to pioneer a new ecological approach in Africa: conservation farming. In 1995, the South African government started a program called Working for Water, in which unemployed people were hired to clear thirsty alien trees from important watersheds around Cape Town. A single eucalyptus consumes up to 100 gallons of water in a day, so removing the trees is like putting water back in the system. ''Rivers that hadn't run in 30, 40 years began to run again,'' said Guy Preston, the founder of Working for Water. That program now operates in every South African province, has an annual budget of $60 million and has inspired a group of sister programs that may change the face of conservation across the continent. Their aim is not just to restore ecosystems but to put them to use for human benefit. Healthy marshlands, for example, serve to purify the water that runs through them. So Working for Wetlands was spun off from Working for Water five years ago and is now employing teams throughout the country to restore marshes. Working on Fire has been dispatching crews since 2003 to prevent and control wildfires. And in Baviaanskloof, Mr. Powell is overseeing Working for Woodlands, a pilot project to reforest subtropical thickets to capture carbon from the atmosphere and support biodiversity on the land. Japie Buckle, a technical adviser at a wetlands restoration site in Agulhas National Park, says some of these benefits are both quick and tangible. ''The nice thing about wetlands is that you start helping the system and it will start helping itself,'' he said. ''Within two years you won't believe it is the same area.'' Another goal is to provide people with skills to help them get jobs in the private sector. All of the programs require that workers be recruited from ''the poorest of the poor,'' and in an effort to raise participation by single parents, 6 of every 10 must be women. Arnold Viegeland, a tall man with a reflective gaze and an easy smile, said he was unemployed when he joined the Working for Water program seven years ago. Today, he oversees 109 workers in two programs and has a bright office at the new Agulhas National Park headquarters. Maps adorn the wall and a new computer hums in the corner. The conservation farming programs' goal of helping people help themselves ''is not just a nice story,'' he said. Still, in South Africa, there is no quick fix when it comes to curing poverty. A Working for Woodlands team leader, Colette Zealand, said she was sick of managing people and would just as soon work on a citrus farm -- though her grin made it hard to tell if she was serious or just fed up after five of her workers had failed to show up because they had been drinking in the local pub, known here as a shebeen. The growth of the conservation farming programs poses a different challenge: stable financing. ''When it comes to operating costs, the financing of a program like this is similar, in some ways, to funding a war,'' said Mr. Powell of Working for Woodlands. ''The cars are going out, the crews are going out, and if you don't come up with some way of financing all that in a sustainable way, your funding sources are going to experience battle fatigue at some point.'' So he is eager to see conservation farming evolve beyond Baviaanskloof onto private farms, where landowners might be compensated for providing services like water filtration, carbon sequestration and fire suppression in much the same way they are paid for oranges, hay and cattle. Timber companies might pay for fire protection, hydroelectric companies for erosion control to keep silt from clogging their turbines, and municipalities for the restored groundwater that ends up in drinking glasses and irrigation ditches. Nonprofit groups and outside governments might even use the emerging worldwide ''carbon trading'' market to pay the programs for taking carbon out of the atmosphere. Driving outside the western edge of the reserve, Mr. Powell pointed out one piece of private property in particular: his own grandfather's farm, one of many where once productive land was devastated by agricultural methods of the past. ''It would be quite ironic someday if I made some money, bought back the very farm that my grandfather stuffed up and fixed it,'' he said. Things are already coming full circle on the Agulhas Plains, where Mr. Buckle and Mr. Viegeland began restoring wetlands on several hundred acres of old farmland last year. ''The farmers are shaking their heads because the state paid them to drain these fields 40 years ago,'' Mr. Buckle said. ''Now the state is paying us to put the water back.'' And so it was that on an early winter morning at the southernmost tip of Africa, two conservationists from very different backgrounds strode out across a flooded plain to measure their restoration progress in mud so thick and wet it threatened to snatch the boots off their feet. The rains had returned to drench the land after several years of drought; a common padloper tortoise ambled in the muck, and in the distance a blue crane coasted in to land. Mr. Buckle sank a boot into the burping mud and smiled. ''You can just hear the difference,'' he said."
"PAUL GRANGER, the superintendent of the Plainview Water District, had to shout over the sound of a 150-horsepower pump as it sucked 995 gallons of water a minute up from a layer of sandy soil 400 feet underground. ''A lot of people don't realize that their water comes out of the ground right underneath them,'' Mr. Granger said, standing inside the small brick building that houses the pump on the front lawn of the district's headquarters on Manetto Hill Road. That underground water supply, or aquifer, supplies the drinking water for nearly three million people living on Long Island. But for two decades, a dangerous and fast-moving gasoline additive called M.T.B.E. has been leaking from underground tanks at gas stations in Nassau and Suffolk Counties -- including near the Plainview pump -- and if left untreated, M.T.B.E. will remain in the aquifer for years, threatening the drinking water. Hundreds of locations all over the Island have been identified as M.T.B.E. spill sites, and battles over who will clean them up -- at a cost that could run into billions of dollars -- are being fought in the courts. In even trace amounts, M.T.B.E., or methyl tertiary butyl ether, makes water smell and taste like turpentine, and the federal Environmental Protection Agency has reported that laboratory rats developed cancer when exposed to high doses. M.T.B.E. has also been a factor in deliberations over national energy policy. A push in the House of Representatives to provide the oil industry with immunity from liability for M.T.B.E. contamination led to an impasse on the energy bill last year, and the immunity effort this year was abandoned only last weekend. Water districts and communities across the Island have filed lawsuits seeking payment for cleaning up and monitoring water. And the spills are everywhere. There are 349 active M.T.B.E. spills being cleaned up or under investigation on Long Island, said Peter A. Scully, the director of the State Department of Environmental Conservation's Long Island office. But according to Toxics Targeting Inc., which compiles environmental-spill data in the state for water suppliers, municipalities and lawyers, there are at least 615 gasoline spill sites or leaking gas tanks containing M.T.B.E. in Nassau County and at least 610 in Suffolk. In Plainview, 2 of the 11 wells that Mr. Granger oversees are about 400 feet from a former Mobil station where in 1997 a ruptured fuel tank was discovered to be leaking gasoline containing M.T.B.E. At the groundwater level there in 2002, ''the concentration my experts have obtained is 20,000 parts per billion of M.T.B.E.,'' he said. The state maximum for drinking water is 10 parts per billion. After the discovery of the looming M.T.B.E. plume, Mr. Granger, a civil engineer and the former chairman of the Long Island Water Conference, a 50-member group of Nassau and Suffolk water suppliers, called public meetings to inform residents in Plainview and nearby Old Bethpage. His district installed three monitoring wells about 100 feet from the water well nearest the gas station. The Exxon Mobil Corporation is paying to clean up the soil and groundwater under the spill, said Mr. Scully, of the Department of Environmental Conservation. Readings taken in January show M.T.B.E. concentrations had been reduced by 66 percent to fewer than 7,000 parts per billion, he said, and monitoring and cleanup will continue until the spill is below allowable levels. Still, Mr. Granger says he awaits the day that M.T.B.E.-contaminated groundwater gets sucked uphill to the supply well as it pumps 1.7 million gallons of water a day. ''It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when,'' he said. When M.T.B.E. is detected, wells will have to be shut down and the water diverted to treatment systems that can cost up to $8 million a well, Mr. Granger and others say. The district sued Exxon Mobil in 2002 in State Supreme Court in Nassau County in an effort to force it to clean up the groundwater and pay Plainview's water-treatment and monitoring costs; Shell was later added as a defendant. The suit also seeks punitive damages of $1 billion or more, said Marc J. Bern, of the law firm Napoli Bern, which also represents the towns of Southampton and East Hampton in other M.T.B.E. lawsuits. Estimates for removing M.T.B.E. from the nation's groundwater vary widely -- from $1.5 billion for cleanup not covered by established funds, as reported by the American Petroleum Institute, to $85 billion, based on an analysis commissioned by the American Water Works Association and the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies. Mr. Bern estimated the cost ''to fully clean the water system and make it viable for generations to come'' on Long Island at $30 billion. Just who will pay the bill remains unanswered. Earlier this month House Republicans led by Joe L. Barton of Texas abandoned their attempt to protect oil companies from M.T.B.E.-contamination lawsuits with a liability waiver in the energy bill. Mr. Barton proposed an $11 billion cleanup fund financed by the oil industry and federal and state governments. But the waiver was removed, and the final energy bill will not address cleanup and remediation costs at all. The courts may now decide who pays for the cleanup. A lawsuit filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan by many Long Island water districts and communities seeks groundwater cleanup, compensation for monitoring and water-treatment costs and punitive damages from more than 70 oil companies, oil refiners and M.T.B.E. manufacturers. Water suppliers and municipalities that have discovered M.T.B.E. contamination in or near wells and are part of the lawsuit include the Suffolk County Water Authority, which supplies 83 percent of the county; the Long Island Water Corporation, which supplies water to 30 Nassau communities including Baldwin, Hewlett and South Hempstead; water districts in Franklin Square, Roslyn, Hicksville, Port Washington, Westbury, Carle Place, West Hempstead, Western Nassau and Great Neck North; Nassau County; and the villages of Sands Point, Mineola and Hempstead. Who may be liable is another issue. It is often impossible to tell which company is responsible for a particular spill, because oil companies commingle their gasoline inside the delivery pipeline and because gasoline plumes with M.T.B.E. travel long distances underground. In April, however, Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District Court ruled that the lawsuit can seek damages based on a shared liability; each oil company or refinery would pay based on its market share. ''That is an extremely important decision,'' said Stanley N. Alpert, an environmental lawyer and a former assistant United States attorney and chief of environmental litigation for the Eastern District of New York, which covers Long Island. ''It's a very important decision that the oil companies will be held liable for their actions.'' M.T.B.E. was first added to gasoline in 1979 to raise the octane level. The 1990 Clean Water Act required gasoline to include an oxygenator -- M.T.B.E. is one, although not the only one -- to reduce air pollution, leading to an increase in M.T.B.E. concentration. Several safer and more biodegradable compounds could have been done the job, lawyers for water suppliers and towns and villages say, but oil companies lobbied to make M.T.B.E. the additive used. That saved the refiners money. ''The oil companies chose M.T.B.E. knowing of its propensity to contaminate groundwater,'' said Steven J. German, a lawyer with Weitz&Luxenberg, a Manhattan firm representing several Long Island water suppliers in the federal lawsuit. Mr. Alpert said: ''These companies knew that they were putting a dangerous product into the ground. The oil companies hid it from Congress, hid it from the public, hid it from mom-and-pop gas station owners. They were told by hydrogeologists, 'Don't put this in the gasoline,' but they did it anyway.'' The liability for M.T.B.E. cleanup lies with the government, said Peter John Sacripanti of McDermott Will&Emery, the lead lawyer for Exxon Mobil in the federal lawsuit. ''The E.P.A. and Congress knew of the characteristics of M.T.B.E. and nonetheless mandated its use,'' he said, ''because they felt that its benefits to clean air outweighed any risk to the groundwater.'' Mr. Sacripanti said that the oil industry used M.T.B.E. and not another compound because no other oxygenator was available in sufficient supply to meet Congress's mandate for reformulated gasoline, which was intended to cut carbon monoxide emissions. ''My client spent hundreds of millions of dollars to retrofit its refineries to make M.T.B.E. to comply with reformulated gasoline requirement,'' he said. At least 36 states have found M.T.B.E. in their water supplies. New York State joined 23 other states and banned it as of January 2004, but that action does not remove the danger already moving in the aquifer. ''It could take hundreds of years for M.T.B.E. to pass through the system, and that does concern us,'' said Paul Ponturo, the public health engineer for the Office of Water Resources of the Suffolk County Health Department. ''We will have to monitor for M.T.B.E. for many generations.'' He said that Suffolk has about 1,000 public supply wells and more than 40,000 private wells, which are much shallower. M.T.B.E. is found in more than 10 percent of public wells and about 10 percent of the 1,000 private wells it checks each year, he said. Concentrations are usually below the standard for safe drinking water, 10 parts per billion, Mr. Ponturo said, but concentrations as high as 1,300 parts per billion have been found, and those wells were shut down. People in primarily rural areas of Suffolk County whose private wells have been affected by an M.T.B.E. plume have complained of asthma, nausea and dizziness. Some say M.T.B.E. caused their cancers. The Suffolk authority, the Island's largest water supplier with more than 500 wells, has detected M.T.B.E. at more than 200 wells over the past five years; the authority can detect levels down to one part per billion. It does not know the source. Wells with levels exceeding the state's maximum of 10 parts per billion, one of the most stringent in the country, have been shut down, said Timothy Hopkins, the authority's general counsel. ''We have put treatment systems on wells where there has been detection of M.T.B.E.,'' he said, adding that the authority's water is safe to drink. M.T.B.E. is more difficult than other contaminants, like degreasers and solvents, to remove from water using the most common method, called air stripping. Complicating matters, no one knows the full extent of contamination of the main aquifer on Long Island. The contamination will worsen, said Walter Hang, the president of Toxics Targeting. ''If you think we have problems now, they're really just a harbinger of things to come,'' he said. ''That's why it is so imperative to take action now to clean up the contaminant before it spreads even farther.'' Mr. Granger, of the Plainview Water District, said that because neither Exxon Mobil nor the Department of Environmental Conservation fully investigated the Plainview plume, he was not sure how much M.T.B.E. would contaminate the Plainview wells or what size equipment would be needed to remove it. But he said that once the contaminant is detected in a well, it will have to be shut down for as long as a year to install a treatment system. The Mobil station in Plainview has since closed, replaced by new businesses. But three years ago, a leak involving M.T.B.E. was discovered at a Shell station across from the former Mobil station. And there is a third gas station at the same intersection, although no leak has been detected there. But having the gas stations there and few public funds to clean up future leaks will most likely mean more court battles and more legal and water-treatment fees. ''My concern is, 5 to 10 years down the road, will we have more wells hit?'' Mr. Granger said. ''Then who will bear the brunt of the cost?'' Long Island Correction: August 14, 2005, Sunday An article on July 31 about the gasoline additive M.T.B.E., which has leaked out of storage tanks and threatens to contaminate water supplies on Long Island, misidentified the 1990 federal act that required the use of certain additives to combat air pollution. It was the Clean Air Act, not the Clean Water Act."
"Workers at a landfill in Orange County, Calif. -- as if tamping down the contents of a wastebasket -- regularly pile one million cubic yards of dirt atop a football field-size section of the giant dump. Six months later, the workers scrape the dirt aside and the dump's surface has fallen 30 to 40 feet, making space for yet more trash. ''It's just amazing,'' said Mike Giancola, deputy director of the county's waste agency. Orange County's method is part of a remarkable productivity story playing out in the trash business, quietly saving consumers, businesses and municipalities billions of dollars a year. It is an unlikely industry for such a leap in efficiency. Simply put, operators of garbage dumps are stuffing more waste than anyone expected into the giant plastic-lined holes, keeping disposal prices down and making the construction of new landfills largely unnecessary. The clearest winner in this development is the City of New York, which exports 25,000 tons of trash a day to other cities and states, making it the waste industry's biggest customer. But the benefits stretch coast to coast and will continue for years to come. The productivity leap is the second major economic surprise from the trash business in the last 20 years. First, it became clear in the early 1990's that there was a glut of disposal space, not the widely believed shortage that had drawn headlines in the 1980's. Although many town dumps had closed, they were replaced by fewer, but huge, regional ones. That sent dumping prices plunging in many areas in the early 1990's and led to a long slump in the waste industry. Since then, the industry and its followers have been relying on time -- about 330 million tons of trash went into landfills in the United States last year alone, according to Solid Waste Digest, a trade publication -- to fill up some of those holes, erase the glut and send disposal prices skyward again. Instead, dump capacity has kept growing, and rapidly, even as only a few new dumps were built. How could that be? Waste companies and municipalities have fit much bigger dumps than originally permitted onto existing acreage, piling trash deeper and steeper, and vastly expanding permitted capacity. They are burying trash more tightly, so that each ton takes up less space, increasingly using giant 59-ton compacting machines guided by global positioning systems that show the operator when he has rolled over a section of the dump enough times. They cover trash at the end of the day, to keep it from blowing away, with tarps or foam or lawn clippings instead of the thick layers of soil that formerly ate up dump capacity. Some operators are blowing water and air into landfills to hasten rotting and thus the shrinkage of buried garbage piles, creating more capacity. Each practice is fairly prosaic, and many operators have yet to adopt the improved methods, but taken together the waste industry is in the early stages of the kind of increase in efficiency more typically seen in technologies like computer chips and turbines that generate electricity. A well-run dump, tightly packed and using minimal dirt as cover, can hold 30 percent or so more trash than a poorly run site, said Thomas M. Yanoschak, a senior project manager at Camp Dresser & McKee, an engineering firm that advises waste sites. ''Operators are much better now,'' he said. The change is shown in the published disposal records of the three largest waste haulers -- Waste Management, Allied Waste Industries and Republic Services -- which combined handle more than half the nation's trash. In the last four years, they buried 882 million tons of waste. But the remaining permitted capacity of their combined 410 dumps did not shrink. It expanded over those four years by more than one billion tons. The three companies now expect expansions of another 1.8 billion tons. At that level, their combined capacity could handle the nation's trash sent to dumps for about 26 years. Smaller companies and municipalities possess huge capacity, too. Taken together, the oversupply is a damper on prices. The nation's average gate rate, the price dumps post publicly, has lagged inflation, rising just 21 percent from 1992, when the original disposal glut first became widely known, to last year, climbing to $35 a ton from $29, according to Solid Waste Digest. Most businesses pay haulers directly for disposal. Many consumers pay through property taxes. At $35 a ton, the 330 million tons buried nationally cost $11.6 billion. (Actual prices are typically lower than gate rates.) Had rates merely kept pace with inflation, disposal in dumps would average $39 a ton, or a collective $12.9 billion a year. And the annual cost would be $16.5 billion had prices, as widely predicted years ago based on an expected shortage, hit $50 a ton. Dennis Pantano, chief operating officer at Regus Industries, a regional waste company based in West Seneca, N.Y., and a former executive at a national waste company, said he had expected ''at least $45 to $50'' by now. Instead, he said, ''In Ohio we're still beating our heads against each other to get $18, $20 a ton -- $25 in western New York. It really hasn't gone up in 10 years. That's obviously because of capacity.'' Environmental regulations, which many feared would cause a disposal shortage, actually helped encourage the glut. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, passed in 1976 but put into effect over more than a decade, requires that liners be used to protect groundwater and that systems to extract water and methane be installed. The cost of all that forced thousands of small dumps to close and encouraged huge new landfills that could pile trash hundreds of feet deep to maximize the return on investment. A 10,000-ton-a-year dump would cost $83 a ton to operate, estimates Solid Waste Digest, while a 300,000-ton-a-year site's cost would be $14 a ton. Dumps taking a million or more tons a year have even lower per-ton costs. So, new replacement landfills were on average 25 times the size of the small ones that were closing, according to Solid Waste Digest. And even though the 8,000 dumps in 1988 fell to fewer than 1,800 today, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, capacity ballooned. Transfer stations, where trash is emptied from local collection trucks and reloaded onto bigger long-haul trucks or onto trains for transport to a dump, now number 3,700 nationally, a vast network extending the reach of giant disposal sites. The nation's 25 biggest dumps, which are beginning to resemble operations in other more efficient and consolidated industries, account for about 24 percent of total capacity, Solid Waste Digest estimates, and that concentration will probably continue. Already, the Republic Services landfill in Las Vegas has more than 200 million tons of space, as does Waste Management's site in Arlington, Ore. And a desert site yet to begin accepting trash, owned by the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County, can hold more than 600 million tons, or enough to take 20,000 tons a day for 100 years. Also, investment in railroad cars and containers for trash, still in its infancy, could further reduce transport costs and smooth out pricing disparities among regions. At present, disposal prices in the Northeast average about 2.5 times the cost to dump in the arid and little-populated Western states. Owners of a recently built 210 million-ton-capacity landfill in Idaho are proposing to use barges to ship much of Hawaii's trash to the West Coast and transport it by rail the remaining distance. Idaho Waste System's gate rate is just $16.50 a ton, said Grant Gauthier, a vice president, and its permit has no daily limit. The company is seeking to expand its permit to 420 million tons, even though it currently takes in just 800 tons a day. If the glut depresses prices, why do waste companies keep expanding their dumps? One reason, for the companies with publicly traded stock, is an accounting rule. Companies must write off, or depreciate, their landfill investments based on the percentage of a site's capacity filled up each year. A dump costing $100 million to build, filled 10 percent, would require $10 million of depreciation, reducing pretax profit by that amount. They set aside funds for post-closing environmental monitoring on a similar as-used schedule. So, the more capacity that can be permitted at each dump, the less depreciation and other costs recorded per ton, lifting reported profits. Waste Management, of course, suffered an accounting scandal in the late 1990's, in part over landfill accounting, and was forced to take a $3.5 billion charge against earnings to clean up its books. Once glamour stocks, waste companies have mostly been mediocre performers in recent years and the growing glut could prolong their problems, especially as municipalities and other major customers become more aware of the oversupply. Indeed, the City of New York does not have a disposal problem. Initial bids to handle the trash hauled by the city for 20 years include per-ton prices at dumps in Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia of the mid-$20's to the mid-$30's, said Harry Szarpanski, assistant sanitation commissioner. The problem is transportation. Shifting from trucks to rail and barges to reduce traffic, New York is taking on huge costs to develop a network of new transfer stations. That could increase prices to $90 a ton or so, Mr. Szarpanski said."
"Each spring, striped bass migrate up the Hudson River in the millions. I can see the Hudson in the distance from my house and although I can't actually see the fish, I can imagine a living wave rippling north to spawn and soak up PCB's. Eight years ago, my son and I caught a 30-inch striper off the mile-long pier, an old railroad spur (the tracks are long gone) that juts into the Hudson in Piermont, N.Y. The minimum length in the river is 18 inches and small school bass are common around the pier, so that was a good fish. Since then, the fishing has really slowed down -- for us, anyway. I had a small boat for a few years, but always seemed to get the tide wrong. The rule about the tides, as I understand it, is that you should be fishing the one you're not. Since health advisories suggest that, because of PCB's in the river, I should eat no more than one striper a month, and my children none at all, I could look on bad luck as a healthy lifestyle. But I don't. Time and tide are related, of course. It is well known that you can only catch fish yesterday. You can prove this law of nature by talking to any fisherman, anywhere. He will always say, ''You should have been here yesterday.'' Unfortunately, whenever I fish, it's always today. This year, however, I found a wrinkle in time. I walked the pier on a couple of days after the season started on March 16 (the season for keeping fish, the actual fishing goes on year-round) and heard of a few fish being caught. Then my neighbors told me, on Monday, that, on Sunday, everyone was catching stripers on the pier. On a weekday afternoon I took my equipment, including a folding chair and a deli lunch, and drove out to the end of the pier (automobile permits are free for residents, but can cost up to $175 a year for nonresidents). I found a fairly secluded spot and baited two lines with bloodworms. They are aptly named, and putting them on a hook is something like an Aztec ritual sacrifice. I cast out the baited rigs and sat down in my folding chair to contemplate the differences between still fishing and fly-fishing. For one thing, with fly-fishing you don't get worm blood on your hands, so lunch is a more pleasant experience. Another difference is that despite its vaguely mystical aura, fly-fishing is a lot like work. I'm a frenetic fly-fisherman. I wade up and down rivers and streams, looking for good spots, changing flies, usually falling and breaking some piece of equipment. Or I stand still and work myself into a frenzy about what fly I should use. I love fly-fishing, but it has never given me a moment's peace. Bait fishing is the true path to serenity. When you bait up a hook with a gob of bloodworms and cast it out into the river, there is nothing to do but wait. You can doze, or check your bait occasionally, or your pulse, if you're not sure you're still alive. You can move spots if you like, but the essence of still fishing is being still. I sat, I watched the river and the gulls. I felt the wind. I was overtaken by the slow and uncooperative rhythms of nature. Time passes. Fish bite. Or not. I did not catch fish. I did, however, achieve enlightenment, so the day wasn't a total bust. My great insight -- the moment of truth -- was when I remembered that my grandmother used to say, ''Today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.'' Perhaps, I thought, there was a fishing corollary, as jumbled, irrational and confusing as the original. What if tomorrow was the yesterday the lucky fishermen were always telling me about? The next morning, I tested my hypothesis. I drove out to a spot on the north side of the pier and stopped to talk to some of the regulars, Jimmy Mulligan, Peter Catanese and John Francesconi, known to his friends as the Michael Jordan of the Hudson. On the pier, most of the regulars are retired. A number of them are involved with the New Jersey chapter of the Hudson River Fisherman's Association (www.hrfanj.org). They not only fish, they also tag bass to track their movements, lobby for access to the river and release almost all of the fish they catch. Their Web site has information on the Hooked on the Hudson Fishing Contest and Shad Bake on April 27, on the river at Ross Dock, Palisades Interstate Park, Fort Lee, N.J. I was trying to get the regulars to tell me how to catch fish. They wanted to impress on me how the fishing regulations should change: a bigger minimum size for keeping bass, and a rule requiring that all females with roe be released. Eventually, I extracted some useful information, and set up at a recommended spot, facing the incoming tide as it was nearing its high point. This time I put really big, bloody gobs of worms on the hook. (Oh, Quetzalcoatl, hear my prayer.) The sky started to darken, the wind picked up and the fish started to hit. For the next hour or so, they kept biting. The first fish I pulled in was probably about 18 inches. Two men next to me started catching fish as well. Then the wind picked up even more and a light rain started and I heard someone shout, ''They're all over the place.'' I caught five fish, most short, and kept one that was 19 inches. Once I had the fish I was going to eat, I stopped. By then the rain was coming down. I took the striper home, filleted and sautéed it, and had my ritual, spring dinner, most likely the only striper I'll kill all year. I went to sleep that night satisfied, and the next morning I woke up with a smile. My plan had worked. Finally, I had been there yesterday. OUTDOORS"
"The widespread contamination of well water with arsenic in China and India has been linked to cancer and blackfoot disease, which brings on gangrene in the feet and legs. Now a new study from Taiwan points to another worry: drinking such water for two decades triples the risk of developing obstructions in the arteries leading to the brain, a danger sign for strokes and heart attacks. In the study, published last month in the journal Circulation, researchers from National Taiwan University looked at 463 people in an area that formerly drew its water largely from contaminated wells. The average arsenic level there was above 300 parts per billion; the Environmental Protection Agency last year reduced allowable levels in the United States from 50 parts per billion to 10 parts per billion. For the study, the researchers divided the subjects into three groups based on how much arsenic they had encountered over the years and used ultrasound tests to look for atherosclerosis. People in the top third -- those who had used the contaminated water for drinking and cooking for 20 years or more -- had a risk three times as great as those in the bottom third. The middle group had a risk twice as great as the bottom group. ''More than 100 million people are exposed to underground water with high concentrations of arsenic,'' said the study's lead author, Dr. Chih-Hao Wang, who called the problem ''an emerging epidemic.'' VITAL SIGNS: HAZARDS"
"Today marks a milestone in American farming. The Agriculture Department introduces a set of standards that define what the word ''organic'' means and which growers and products are qualified to use it. While most Americans tend to think of organic food as somehow healthier for themselves and their children, there is no hard evidence to support that. The real value of organic farming is its impact on our soil and water and livestock, on the very idea of farming itself. For that alone, it deserves our support. Until now, foods and farms have been certified as organic by various states and organizations. What begins today is a national program representing the best standards in organic farming created by the organic farming community. It took the U.S.D.A. a while to get the regulations right. But nearly every effort to adulterate the purity of the standards was blocked by an outpouring of public comment. What remains is the single best guarantee Americans have that what is being sold as ''organic'' -- bearing the new U.S.D.A.-Organic seal -- is just what it says. Organic farming began as a fringe movement in the 1960's but has since become a $9 billion industry that is increasing by 20 percent each year, according to the Organic Trade Association. The popularity of organic food is based on the so-far undocumented belief that it is healthier. But there are other good reasons to buy organic food. First, it often tastes better. Second, the very definition of ''organic'' explains one of its main attractions. Organic farming depends on the concept of the soil as a ''living system.'' In an organic system, which relies on crop rotations, animal manures, green manures and biological pest control, the soil grows richer and richer, more and more fertile. Organic farms do not contaminate groundwater, nor do they create toxic runoff. Their soil doesn't blow or wash away. This stands in direct contrast to the rest of American agriculture over the past half-century, a tale of grievous erosion, of poisoned wells and rivers, and an agricultural effluent that has created an enormous dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Buying certified organic food is a way to support the health of the soil itself. The introduction of these new organic standards is the beginning of the story, rather than the end of it. The standards will have to be protected against attempts to weaken them. Perhaps the biggest challenge is discerning the impact of these standards on organic farmers themselves. To some, the idea of federal standards is the antithesis of the spirit of organic farming. For most, however, it's a welcome opportunity to reach a broader public. There are still concerns over scale, too, as more and more small organic food companies are being bought up by the big players, like General Mills. Nonetheless, this is a new day for organic farming and a welcome one."
"Dr. Shahana Urooj Kazmi earned a Ph.D. in microbiology in the United States with research on camphylobacter, which causes diarrhea in infants. Now the chairwoman of the University of Karachi's department of microbiology, she can walk a novice through the gut-wrenching symptoms of e. coli, shigella, giardia and sundry other intestinal bugs with the detachment of a bored tour guide on a London double-decker. Dr. Kazmi doesn't drink the water in Karachi. Enough said? Well, not really. Plenty of cities have water problems. Few have water problems to rival Karachi's. One scientist here tied Karachi water a few years ago to 50 separate ailments. A second recent analysis by government water experts found at least 70 percent of all Karachi water samples fouled by microbes, chemical pollutants, or both. ''It can cause skin problems and gastrointestinal problems,'' Dr. Kazmi said. ''It can cause an infection if it gets into a cut. It can cause hepatitis A and hepatitis E. It can cause rotovirus.'' Dr. Kazmi has made Karachi's water both a personal and educational cause, sending her students out to collect and analyze water samples and to publicize the results. As happens every time someone releases a damning study about Karachi water, city officials have gotten angry. Dr. Kazmi says that is of no concern to her. ''We are a public university,'' she said, ''supported by the public sector.'' The latest official to be nettled is Javed Ashraf, a retired army brigadier general with a rapid-fire conversational style and a deceptively easy demeanor. General Ashraf, however, is different. He actually intends to do something about it. Since late August, General Ashraf has been the managing director of the Karachi Sewer and Water Board, hand-picked by Pakistan's leadership and told to solve the water woes of this sprawling megalopolis. Even here, few tasks are more daunting. Fifty years ago, Karachi was a placid port town of 435,000 souls. Twenty years ago, it had 5 million. Today it is 14 million strong, an awesome jumble of sepia-toned slums and high-rises. In Karachi, people either boil their tap water, boil water taken from grimy trucks roving the streets, boil water lifted from brackish, sewage-fouled wells -- or, if they are lucky enough to afford it, buy bottled water. They should boil that, too: the government says that 11 of 21 brands of bottled water are themselves too contaminated for safe drinking. General Ashraf's job is not simply to find more water, or to purify the water people now get. It is a desperate race just to keep up with the needs of a city that is metastasizing beyond the ability of normal public servants to cope. ''Karachi isn't a city, it's a country,'' General Ashraf said. ''Karachi is imploding and exploding at the same time. Because there is no regulated framework, there are high-rises where two-story frameworks are supposed to be. Things go there, and there, and there. Colonies are set up.'' The water system starts with a big handicap: its main source of supply, the Indus River, is heavily polluted from huge cities like Lahore by the time it reaches the Arabian seacoast. Beyond that, some 250 million gallons of raw Karachi sewage are dumped daily just upstream of the lake that supplies most city water. Amazingly, General Ashraf says, the water board still manages to chlorinate much of Karachi's water, making it relatively bug-free. The trouble starts after treatment. The population explosion has created a water shortage totaling nearly 170 million gallons a day. The constant emptying and refilling of mains -- in flat Karachi, all water must be pumped under pressure -- strains 40-year-old pipes and creates bacteria-attracting leaks. Unable to wait for city services, thirsty new slums plug their own dirty pipes into city networks, spreading contamination. (Only 1.25 million customers are formally hooked up, and only 250,000 of those pay their bills.) Residents have taken to storing water in underground tanks that, seldom, if ever, cleaned, turn into huge petri dishes. High-rise clusters overtax the sewage system, which then overflows into wells and into the leaky water mains. Only seven in 10 gallons of water actually reaches the tap. Nobody knows the consequences of all this with precision. But the anecdotal evidence is sobering. When tap water becomes turbid, as it periodically does, hospitals swell with sick babies and the elderly, who lack the immunity induced by regular exposure to stomach bugs. City water bureaucrats have heard about such concerns before, and dismissed them. General Ashraf, operating under a presidential mandate, insists he has grand proposals to redress them. He plans to bring 100 million more gallons of water into the city daily, to ease the chronic shortage. That will strain water mains, he says, so the water board must upgrade many of its 20,000 miles of pipes. Down the road are plans to desalinate sea water. Before any of that, he says ruefully, ''the most important thing I need to do is to get my database ready.'' ''We don't have any data,'' he said. ''Until we have the information, we can't begin to make changes.'' Change, Dr. Kazmi says, can't come fast enough. ''In this heat,'' she said, waving toward a university courtyard parboiling under the midday sun, ''anything can survive in the water.'' Karachi Journal"
"Intrepid Males Heed Clues When it's springtime on the prairie, a male gall wasp's thoughts turn to romance. Having developed inside a stem of a plant of the Silphium genus and having spent the winter cooped up in said stem (after it died and fell to the ground), the male emerges and looks for a mate. But the prairie is worse than a singles bar in a mining town. There are no females around; they emerge a few days later. So what's a red-blooded male gall wasp to do? Fortunately, as Dr. Lawrence M. Hanks, an entomologist at the University of Illinois, and colleagues discovered, the males can follow chemical cues from the plant to find stems with females and wait for them to emerge. The researchers, whose study appears in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, studied gall wasps in prairie dock and another Silphium species, the compass plant. Wasps emerge from compass plant stems about a month before they emerge from prairie dock stems. So when a male emerges from a compass plant, it has to find other compass plant stems on the ground if it hopes to find any females soon. (And as the males only have a week or two to live, time is of the essence.) Silphium plants contain terpenes and have a turpentinelike smell, but the mixtures of terpenes differ between species. The researchers showed that the compass plant wasps were able to recognize other compass plant stems using their sense of smell. After they found a compass plant stem, the males were able to locate a female inside, again by smell. To recognize the location, Dr. Hanks said, they relied on changes in the composition of the terpenes -- changes the wasps apparently made themselves. Some insects that live off plants are known to affect the release of plant chemicals, often as a way to discourage competition from other insects. But this is the first known instance of an insect's altering the composition of plant chemicals to enable one insect to find a mate. Oil Spills Last and Last The oil that spilled from an aging tanker off Spain last week caused immediate devastation along its northwestern coast. Millions of dollars will have to be spent to restore beaches and rocky areas. But oil spills can have effects that last long after the initial cleanup. Just how long is unclear -- spills are a relatively modern phenomenon, after all -- but a new study of an area devastated by a spill 33 years ago gives some idea of how the effects can linger. On Sept. 16, 1969, a barge spilled 175,000 gallons of fuel oil into Buzzards Bay in Massachusetts, contaminating salt marshes and killing fish and wildlife. The site has been studied extensively since then, and researchers have consistently found petroleum hydrocarbons in the marsh sediments. The latest study, by researchers at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and reported in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, is no exception. In sediment cores taken in 2000, the researchers found hydrocarbons at depths of 2 to 11 inches. The residues were in approximately the same concentrations as found in the immediate aftermath of the accident, and the researchers say their work suggests the contamination will remain indefinitely. Penguin Calamity The emperor penguin colony at Cape Crozier in Antarctica is suffering from a calamity caused by nature, not humans. The colony has been disrupted by the movement of two huge icebergs near the cape, according to researchers who have observed the birds. The two bergs have hit the shoreline, creating ice fractures and buildup that have prevented some of the emperors from getting food for their young. The ice also seems to have forced the colony, which a few years ago had about 2,400 adults, to break up into groups. The researchers, from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, say the number of breeding pairs has sharply declined. Observatory"
"When Robert King climbed back on the boat after snorkeling off the Great Barrier Reef here on March 31, he knew something was wrong. ''I don't feel so good,'' he said, rubbing his chest. He had been stung by a jellyfish, and his condition deteriorated rapidly. By the time the emergency helicopter arrived, he was screaming in agony; a few hours later he was in a coma, eyes frozen wide, bleeding into his brain. He never regained consciousness. Mr. King, 44, from Columbus, Ohio, was the second person in Australia to die this year from the sting of a species of jellyfish, Carukia barnesi, found only in Australia and never before known to be fatal. More than 200 other victims went to hospitals, several times the number in a normal summer season here. In many places around the world, jellyfish populations are sharply increasing, stinging more people and wreaking economic damage. While in some areas the increase appears to be part of a natural cycle (jellyfish populations are declining in some other areas), scientists have noticed an overall upward trend. And they suspect that human activity is to blame. ''Jellies are a pretty good group of animals to track coastal ecosystems,'' said Dr. Monty Graham, a jellyfish scientist at the University of South Alabama. ''When you start to see jellyfish numbers grow and grow, that usually indicates a stressed system.'' Those stresses include increased water temperature, a rise in nutrients in the water and depleted stocks of other fish, all of them often caused by humans. Higher nutrient levels in the water, which tend to support larger populations of jellyfish, can result from runoff of fertilizer and sewage. Overfishing removes the jellyfish's main competitor for food. Debate continues about the rising water temperatures worldwide and whether they result, at least partly, from global warming -- the greenhouse effect caused by the burning of fossil fuel. Being mostly water, jellyfish react strongly and quickly to all of these changes. In a sense, the jellyfish is like the pigeon in today's cities, able to flourish in environments distorted by humans while other species cannot survive at all. Distinctly unlike the pigeon, however, jellyfish release millions of microscopic harpoons when touched, shooting tiny hypodermic needles into a victim's skin. They are lined with barbs and filled with venom, and they often linger painfully in the skin for months after the toxin has worn off. That experience is becoming more common around the world. On Waikiki Beach in Hawaii, for example, a lifeguard, Landy Blair, counted more than 900 stings on a single day this season, about 1 percent of them sending victims to hospitals. Mr. Blair has been keeping track of jellyfish populations near the beach since 1991. The problem has grown steadily worse, he said, adding, ''We have seen the highest numbers ever over the past year.'' On the beaches near Auckland, New Zealand, half a dozen sting victims have required hospitalization this year, Robert Ferguson of Surf Life Saving New Zealand, a lifeguard group, reported. ''It's the first time I've ever heard of victims needing hospital care,'' Mr. Ferguson said. ''This is a new type of jellyfish with stings that are much more severe, much harsher.'' The situation is the same in Australia. ''This year is incredibly abnormal,'' said Dr. Jamie Seymour, a jellyfish expert at James Cook University. He believes that strong, unusual wind patterns help blow the jellyfish toward the shore, where they flourish in unseasonably warm waters. Dr. Seymour, who has analyzed the venom from each sting that receives hospital treatment in the Barrier Reef region for years, had never seen the type of venom that killed the two tourists this year. Dr. Seymour believes that the enormous increase of jellyfish near the shore has brought rarer, more deadly subspecies into contact with humans for the first time. Booming jellyfish populations can also take a high economic toll. In the Gulf of Mexico, shrimp fishermen are struggling with a jellyfish boom that fills nets with slimy gelatin and financial ledgers with millions of dollars in losses. While populations appear to be down this year, Dr. Graham, of South Alabama, sees a ''statistically solid increase'' in the region over the longer term. Jellyfish first gained major scientific attention in the 1980's, when a huge jellyfish bloom devastated the Black Sea, an ecosystem already weakened by overfishing of anchovies. Scientists believe that the jellyfish, an Atlantic native named Mnemiopsis leidyi, hitched a ride on the bottom of a ship and then rapidly multiplied, feeding on anchovy eggs and the plankton that young fish rely on. More recently in Hawaii, overfishing of stocks like ahi and mahi-mahi -- as well as a depletion of sea turtle populations, another predator of the jellyfish -- is partly responsible for the jellyfish boom there, said Dr. Angel Yanagihara, who heads a jellyfish research laboratory at the University of Hawaii. For her, jellyfish blooms are simply responses to the stresses that humans have put on the environment. ''It's a wake-up call by nature,'' Dr. Yanagihara said. Australia was stunned into action by the two deaths, which officials fear could hurt tourism. ''No one cared until someone died,'' said Dr. Seymour, a member of a hastily convened commission. At the same time, some here see the jellyfish boom as an opportunity. The Queensland Fisheries Service, intrigued that Australian waters are so hospitable to jellyfish, is considering setting up a commercial fishing operation for the edible jellyfish Catostylus mosaicus. That fish is popular in many Asian countries, but it is declining in Asian waters, probably because of pollution. Dr. Seymour said people could eat the highly venomous box jellyfish if they cut the tentacles off, although he remains fairly unimpressed with jellyfish as a food source. ''They basically taste like whatever sauce they've got on them,'' he said."
"For hundreds of millions of years, horseshoe crabs have spawned with relatively little fanfare. This spring, however, as they have hauled themselves up on the beaches of Delaware Bay, they have been counted, collected for bait, observed, and argued over. Last fall, Jim Berkson of the Horseshoe Crab Research Center at Virginia Tech conducted one of the first extensive trawling surveys of horseshoe crab population. This weekend, Berkson and his colleagues will be flying over the Delaware shoreline with digital video cameras to document the number of crabs on the beaches. Environmentalists and birders are tracking the crab population as well, because a huge surge in the number of crabs collected for bait in the last decade, and a decrease in the number of the shorebirds that feed on them -- red knots in particular -- have caused alarm. The issue is simple enough in its general outline, but one part is missing -- how many horseshoe crabs there are, and exactly what is happening to the population. There is no question that there has been an enormous assault on the population on the East Coast. In the 1990's, the take of horseshoe crabs jumped from the thousands into the millions, because of a burgeoning fishery for whelk (also called conch, or, on the plate in an Italian restaurant, scungili) and eels. Perry Plumart, the National Audubon Society's director of government relations, wrote in 2000 on the proposed regulations to the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, ''It is known that in the last five years alone between 15 and 20 million horseshoe crabs have been landed.'' Observers had noted fewer crabs on the beaches in the spring over time, and several surveys showed a drastic decline in the availability of eggs, a main food for red knots and other shorebirds that stop to feed on their long migration. For some of the birds, being able to fatten up in the Delaware Bay is a matter of life and death. The bay is the most important stop for migratory shorebirds in the lower 48 states. Lobbying by environmental groups managed to bring about restrictions on the harvest of crabs and the establishment of a sanctuary in the bay, but the harvesting is still going on and one significant problem is that horseshoe crabs take about 10 years to mature sexually. Current restrictions, put in place by the fisheries commission and the individual states, still allow females heavy with eggs to be taken. The restrictions may be insufficient to protect the crabs and birds, according to Plumart and others. Berkson's goal is to provide the solid numbers that will help the conflict to be resolved. He conducted a trawl survey off the Atlantic coast from Cape May, N.J., to Ocean City, Md., and said the estimate of the number of crabs in that area was a little over 11 million. That did not include small crabs, he said, and, given the nature of the survey, the true number could be from 6 million to 17 million. Given the harvesting rate in the past, that is not necessarily encouraging, but Berkson said there were horseshoe crab populations up and down the coast and at the moment, he said, the population was not endangered or threatened. What is not known, however, is how fast the population is declining and how fast reproduction is replacing crabs. For Plumart, the lack of knowledge is a call to action, not only to research the numbers, which National Audubon strongly supports, but also to impose tougher restrictions. The numbers of crabs are declining, as are the birds, he says. And if we're not sure what's going on, that argues to play it safe, particularly since the birds need an abundance of eggs to survive their journey. Dery Bennett, president of the American Littoral Society, agrees. ''It seems to us as if the handwriting is there. We probably ought to lay off these animals completely.'' Berskon said, ''My opinion is that we have enough crabs out there for the shorebirds, for the biomedical community and for some harvest.'' What is not known, he said, is what level of harvest is tolerable to the crab population. ''Nobody knows if measures taken so far are sufficient or overkill.'' The issue is not merely one of conservation; horseshoe crab blood is a basis for a required biomedical test of bacterial contamination to determine the safety of drugs, intravenous solutions and some medical devices. Estimates of the size of the industry vary but it is at least $50 million. Berkson is currently waiting for an assurance that he will get money for the next trawl survey, as well as a federal appropriations measure that would provide $700,000 a year for five years for monitoring the horseshoe crab population. In the meantime, the fishing continues, and another organization, the nonprofit Ecological Research and Development Group in Lewes, Del., is looking for technical solutions. ''We're an odd group within the environmental community,'' said Glenn Gauvrey, the group's president. ''We really are against regulation.'' Instead, Gauvrey's organization has been conducting research on alternative bait for whelk fishing, and on a very simple solution, that may be one of the only things everyone involved with the issue agrees on -- bait bags. The bait bag, first developed by a whelk fisherman, is simply an enclosure of rigid plastic mesh that protects the crab used as bait. Consequently, whelk fisherman can cut down on the amount of bait in traps because fewer creatures are able to eat it in bags, so it lasts longer. The ecological research group now makes and gives the bags away free, and fishermen are starting to make their own. The bait bag, Gauvrey says, could cut use of horseshoe crabs in half. Plumart supports use of the bags. Bennett thinks they're a good idea. Virginia has made them mandatory. If, as all evidence suggests, they allow roughly the same catch of whelk with less bait, they will save money for fishermen. ''The bait bags are an incredibly good idea,'' Berkson said. ''It looks like we have significantly reduced the number of horseshoe crabs needed for bait.'' Gauvrey, he said, ''has probably done more for horseshoe crab conservation than anybody up and down the coast.'' But, Berkson said, the essential question, at the heart of all the discussion of horseshoe crabs, and on which there is not agreement, remains, ''How many can we take?'' OUTDOORS"
"When I started telling a friend about Long Island's wild brook trout, he said, ''All two of them?'' You can't blame him. When I think of Long Island, I think of stripers or blues or tuna. (Not that I catch them, but I think of them.) I associate brook trout with small, stony streams in the Adirondacks. Those mountain brookies are hungry fish usually, and not picky about what they eat. All you have to do is hike a few miles, crawl on your hands and knees to the edge of the brook (watch out for poison ivy) andmake sure not to cast a shadow, hook the brush or swat the black flies that are bleeding you dry in the middle of your cast. That's all there is to it, any fly that isn't too huge, and looks vaguely like something that might live in the stream, will do, as long as you get a drag-free cast, or drop if the stream is really small. Do all this and you will be rewarded with a fresh, beautiful fish that will probably run anywhere from four to six inches long, what old Adirondackers call speckled trout, or speckles. You can also catch them in beaver ponds, if you can figure out how to breathe with a cloud of gnats around your mouth and nostrils. I exaggerate, of course. Sometimes you don't have to crawl, there aren't always black flies and the fish can get mighty big if there's a pool. I've seen them eight inches if they're a centimeter. This is a parochial viewpoint, it turns out, a result of spending too much time (although oddly still not enough) in the Adirondacks. There are other wild brookies on Cape Cod, in New Jersey and in spring creeks on Long Island. The Carman's River is an idyllic, meandering, sandy-bottomed stream that winds through pine woods in the oasis of Southhaven County Park in Brookhaven, N.Y. Less than a half-mile from houses and only minutes from highways, strip malls and fast food, the creek is clear and cold, popular with egrets, ducks and and local fly fishers. I went to take a look at the Carman's after talking to Dave Thompson of the Art Flick Chapter of Trout Unlimited, which works to protect the Carman's fishery. He told me that the chapter had successfully lobbied the state Department of Environmental Conservation to limit stocking of 2-year-old brown trout in the Carman's, because his group was worried about the effect of these fish on the naturally reproducing brookies. The Carman's has a long history. It is where Daniel Webster supposedly caught an enormous 14 1/2-pound sea run brook trout, or ''salter,'' back in 1827. That may be an exaggeration, and the brook trout in the Carman's now do not run large, but they do thrive on their own, for as long as the river can stay protected. Other streams on Long Island, such as Mud Creek, have heritage strains of brook trout, meaning the same strain of fish has been there since long before anyone even imagined the Long Island Rail Road. Thompson grew up on Long Island, left and moved back, and was surprised to find that despite development, some small streams he had fished as a child still had brookies. ''I cut my teeth on little brook trout when I was 4, 5, 6 years old,'' he said. ''That kind of connection really bonds you with brook trout.'' He became determined to contribute to the effort to protect the fish. The Carman's has faced several threats, including groundwater pollution and proposed developments. The Art Flick chapter now works with the conservation department to do regular monitoring of insect life in the stream, using the caddis fly, mayfly and stonefly larvae as aquatic canaries. The Carman's is a minimalist's stream, a small elegant taste of the wild where you would least expect it. But the fishing is not easy, and you have to be willing to work as hard to catch an 8-inch fish as you might to catch a 20-pound striper. Unlike Adirondack brookies, these trout are picky and used to fishermen. Small flies are the rule, and three-weight rods are the tackle of choice. On a midweek afternoon and evening when I fished there, I watched great egrets, deer, nesting swans and a kingfisher. I ducked under overhanging trees, tried to make 10-foot casts at undercut banks and felt like I was alone on the planet. There were fish rising, but I hadn't been successful in getting them to take the small caddis and caddis nymph imitations I was using, so when I met another angler, I stopped to watch him. Soon, another person showed up with a camera, Jim Ludlow taking photographs for a Trout Unlimited newsletter, and the three of us struck up a conversation. Ludlow and I watched, both of us with cameras, and offered extremely unhelpful suggestions (''Come on, why don't you catch one?'') to Bob Napoli for about 45 minutes as he tried different flies. We talked about the characteristics of different streams, the pleasures of wild trout and the fragility of the park. As darkness approached, Napoli said, ''Got him,'' and we watched him bring in an eight-inch brook trout, richly colored and much larger in spirit than in size. I asked him what he was using and he said a size 22 Griffith's gnat. ''That's a good-sized fish,'' Ludlow said. OUTDOORS"
"Most oil pollution in North American coastal waters comes not from leaking tankers or oil rigs, but rather from countless oil-streaked streets, sputtering lawn mowers and other dispersed sources on land, and so will be hard to prevent, a panel convened by the National Academy of Sciences says in a new report. The thousands of tiny releases, carried by streams and storm drains to the sea, are estimated to equal an Exxon Valdez spill -- 10.9 million gallons of petroleum -- every eight months, the report says. When fuel use on water, either inland or offshore, is also taken into account, the report says, about 85 percent of the 29 million gallons of marine oil pollution in North America each year comes from users -- drivers, businesses, boaters -- and not from the oil industry. In particular, spills from tankers, barges and other oil transport vessels totaled less than a quarter-million gallons in 1999, down from more than six million in 1990. The shift follows a substantial tightening of environmental regulations on oil exploration and shipping since the grounding of the Exxon Valdez in 1989. The new report is the academy's third examination of marine oil pollution since 1975, but the first since the Exxon Valdez spill. More than half the oil runoff in North America occurs along the East Coast from Virginia to Maine, the report said. That concentration of oil pollution, the authors said, reflects the density of people, vehicles and other sources in the corridor from Washington to Boston. Oil carried in runoff is particularly damaging, the report said, because it typically ends up discharged by rivers and streams into bays and estuaries that ''are often some of the most sensitive ecological areas along the coast.'' That relentless runoff carries traces of a host of chemicals that are found in most fuels and that can harm marine life even in low concentrations. ''We've all seen the sheen on the streets,'' said one author, Dr. Nancy N. Rabalais, a marine biology professor at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium. ''That eventually is going to run off and end up in a river. The cumulative effect of human activity all over the landscape eventually gets into the sea.'' Worldwide, the panel estimated, 70 percent of marine oil pollution comes from fuel users, not producers or shippers. The panel said one significant source of oil pollution, though a much smaller one than fuel use on land, was the two-cycle engines still used in many outboard boats and personal watercraft like Jet Skis. Those engines use a small amount of unburned fuel as lubricant and then expel it. The report encouraged the Environmental Protection Agency to continue to promote a shift to different engine designs, and groups representing the watercraft industry said yesterday the move was under way. The academy's findings echo a growing consensus in recent years that ''nonpoint'' pollution, from countless dispersed sources, poses one of the nation's most serious and intractable environmental problems. With tankers or oil fields, specific agencies can require double hulls or dikes to hold back leaks, but no agency polices parking-lot runoff. ''There are lots of good regulations in the Clean Water Act that deal with point discharges, and we have the Coast Guard to deal with oil spills,'' Dr. Rabalais said. ''But no matter whether it's pesticides, fertilizers, oil or grease, we're not to the point of managing these things. And they are very important.'' The study, by 14 scientists and engineers, including some from the oil industry, was produced by the National Research Council, the branch of the National Academy of Sciences that conducts independent studies for the government. While emphasizing the problem of oil pollution in runoff, the report noted a sharp drop in the number and volume of accidental spills by tankers and barges in American waters since the Valdez grounding. Even with that improved record, the report said, it is important for governments to continue intensifying safeguards against such accidents, because the transporting of oil around the world will increase steadily. But it is just as important to start focusing on ways to better measure oil releases destined for waterways and to pinpoint their sources, the report said. William D. Hickman, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group in Washington, said the report correctly highlighted both progress in the oil industry and continuing pollution problems. The report also said more work should be done to understand the effect of oil seeping naturally from underwater deposits in the ocean. Humans release about 210 million gallons of petroleum a year into the seas, the report said, while natural seepage adds 180 million gallons."
"Some kinds of wildlife inspire more human support than others. Imperiled suckerfish, woodpeckers and red-legged frogs have managed to stall developments and spare wilderness around the country, but their advocates tend to be environmental lawyers, not ordinary nature lovers. The majestic loon, however, is another story. For people summering around the lakes of the northeastern United States and Canada, the large black and white loon is revered for its maniacal cry, its elegant look and its unfailing ability to sell any T-shirt or coffee mug emblazoned with its distinguished profile. So the news that loons are not doing so well in Adirondack State Park hits home, or in some cases, the second homes that stretch across much of this vast outback. For the last few years, a group of wildlife experts has been testing about 100 common loons in the Adirondacks to chart their whereabouts, their reproductive success and their general well-being. These experts go out at night and stun the big birds by shining lights into their flaming red eyes, then gently capture them for tagging, weighing and taking a few drops of blood. The results of three years of these tests were reported last month, and the news was not encouraging. A full 17 percent of the loons tested were at risk from mercury contamination. Farther east, the percentage is even higher. Mercury, once a convenient component of thermometers and barometers, is now recognized as a very unhealthy element for living things. Even in Lewis Carroll's day, 140 years ago, it was known that hat makers who were exposed to mercury for years on end had tremors and hallucinations -- a recognized hazard of the Mad Hatter's occupation. Loons have also been known to turn odd when overloaded with mercury from eating contaminated fish. In particular, chicks begin preening more than is usual even for the young. The affected babies can also stray too far from their regular perch on top of the mother loon, who provides her checkerboard featherbed for her young's protection. Such errant behavior can make it easy for loon predators like large fish or eagles to dine on these little balls of down, leaving fewer loons for future nocturnal vocalizing. Mercury is an especially difficult problem in some Adirondack lakes because the acidic water converts it into a more toxic form. There are a number of sources of toxic mercury in the Adirondacks, but being downwind of the Midwest's old power plants does not help. The smokestacks still spew sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury into the atmosphere, which then scatters over lakes and forests in the Northeast and parts of Canada. Last month, the Bush administration announced plans to soften the Clean Air Act so utilities could upgrade their old plants without adding costly new antipollution equipment. The administration has also not shown signs of supporting an important acid rain bill, by Senator James Jeffords of Vermont, that would reduce emissions of airborne pollutants by 2008. The bill includes a salutary 90 percent cut in mercury emissions. Loon specialists like Dr. Nina Schoch of the Adirondack Cooperative Loon Program acknowledge that the acid rain and the mercury emissions affect a number of other birds in the northeastern lakes. But many people have a hard time getting excited about a contaminated duck. ''It's amazing how attached people are to the loons,'' Dr. Schoch said. ''Protecting them sometimes becomes a way for people to begin caring more about the environment.'' Question: Is there a nice lake at Camp David? Editorial Observer"
"The arsenic, a slow, sadistic killer, has just about finished its work on Fazila Khatun. She teeters now. The fatigue is constant. Pain pulses through her limbs. Warts and sores cover the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet, telltale of the long years of creeping poison. Mrs. Khatun is hardly alone in this suffering. Bangladesh is in the midst of what the World Health Organization calls the ''largest mass poisoning of a population in history.'' Tens of thousands of Bangladeshis show the outward signs of the same decline. Some 35 million are drinking arsenic-contaminated water, the poison accumulating within them day by day, sip by sip. This calamity is accompanied by paradox. For two decades, the government, along with Unicef and various aid groups, desperately worked to wean the nation from pond water, often an incubator for lethal disease. People were instead urged to install tube wells, tapping into the plentiful supply of underground aquifers. Regrettably, no one had tested these subterranean sources for arsenic. By the mid-1990's, Bangladeshi officials -- once reluctant to provoke alarm -- finally admitted that yet another tragedy was unfolding in their impoverished, disaster-plagued nation. In 1998, the World Bank sped the normal paperwork and lent the government $32.4 million to act on the emergency. Every tube well was to be tested. Safe sources of water were to be provided. But the race against time has gone badly. In the four years since The New York Times first looked into the situation, the nation's ''arsenic mitigation project'' has been hobbled by the unforeseen problems of so unprecedented a crisis. It is yet another example of how the world's poor continue to die from unsafe water, a threat long ago surmounted by the wealthy. Suspicious of each other, the World Bank and the government became stubbornly bound up in their mutual bureaucracies, many critics say. Most of the country's estimated 11 million wells have yet to be tested. Most stricken villages are absent solutions. Most people -- the trusting converts to the ''safety'' of tube wells -- are baffled when now told that within the water lie the malign beginnings of arsenic-induced cancer. ''It seems like nonsense to people, telling them the water is killing them when it looks so clean and nice,'' said Dr. Allan H. Smith, an epidemiologist at the University of California at Berkeley and an expert on arsenic. Dr. Smith has called the situation in Bangladesh ''the highest environmental cancer risk ever found,'' worse than Bhopal or Chernobyl. ''People need to stop drinking the contaminated water,'' he said. ''But they don't seem to pay attention unless there are people around them showing signs of the disease, which is of course what we're trying to prevent.'' Here in the village of Chotobinar Chap, with the cancer pulling her under, Mrs. Khatun seems to have surrendered. She has no strength for work. She has no appetite for meals. She lies in a spare room beneath a thatched roof. ''I feel myself fading away, and sometimes I ask God to take me,'' she muttered. ''My husband has abandoned me. He doesn't even look at me anymore.'' For nearly two decades, Mrs. Khatun, 39, pumped the iron handle of a tube well sunk in her front yard beside a palm tree. Her father-in-law, Abdul Hakim, his six sons and all their families used the same convenient apparatus. Two years ago, the water was tested. The arsenic concentration measured .760 milligrams per liter, 15 times the amount considered safe by Bangladesh standards and 76 times the limit set by the World Health Organization. Arsenic, a speedy killer in high doses, is a sluggish and fickle assailant in low ones. The poison requires 2 to 10 years or more to work its damage and it affects different people in different ways -- and some, seemingly, not at all. While Mrs. Khatun is the most woefully stricken in her family, others have the same nodules on their palms and heels and dark spots on much of their skin. Still others, their thirst slaked from the same well, show no signs at all. Informed of the danger, the family beseeched, ''Where can we get safe water?'' Here again the arsenic displayed its erratic hand, for some of the wells here are terribly tainted and others, just yards away, are harmless. The nearest safe water for the family was beside a neighbor's home a quarter mile away. To get there required a walk on a narrow mud path, past several houses with shiny tin roofs, past ponds where animals bathed and algae bloomed. ''It was hard to fetch water from so far away,'' said Mr. Hakim, a weaver. Dark spots pocked his bare chest. ''One of my daughters-in-law would go and carry back a full pitcher for drinking. But sometimes the path was too muddy. It was knee deep. She couldn't wade through it and she stopped going.'' It is difficult to predict how many Bangladeshis will eventually die from causes related to the arsenic. Most researchers, including Dr. Smith, are shy with estimates. Richard Wilson, a Harvard physicist who is an expert in risk analysis, puts the number at one million. Dr. Sk. Ahktar Ahmad, a public health specialist with the government, predicts a total of three million to five million. Any such arithmetic is highly speculative. The morbid work of the arsenic -- a persistent nudging toward cancers of the liver, lung, bladder or kidney -- can be halted in most cases by simply switching to safe water, doctors say. So the question is: How many Bangladeshis will be persuaded to switch? And, if persuaded, how many can find water both safe and accessible? Alternatives do exist. There are even ways to filter arsenic from water. But each solution requires effort, to educate villagers and to pay for the required equipment. With 130 million people, Bangladesh is the world's eighth most populous nation, its citizens packed into a territory slightly smaller than Wisconsin. The average per capita income is $370. Arsenic has competition on the nation's mortality tables. Each year, pneumonia kills 91,000 children under age 5. Diarrhea claims 61,000 more. Tobacco surely rivals arsenic as a progenitor of fatal cancer. Mother Nature, prone to furious mood swings, is often a mass murderer. In the wet summers, melting snow from the Himalayas joins with monsoon rains to overwhelm the rivers, flooding as much as two-thirds of the landscape. In dry months, the fierce sun can parch the soil enough to trigger a famine. A few miles from here is Khandkar Kalagachia. As in most hamlets, there is water, water everywhere: wells, ponds, irrigated fields. Though many of the villagers display signs of the poisoning, it is hard to know the extent of the contamination. Khandkar Kalagachia lies on the wrong side of the road, among the 77 percent of the nation's ''hot spot'' areas still untested. Muhammad Ahsanullah, a rickshaw puller, endures an overwhelming itchiness, another of the symptoms. His hands are always in motion, scratching their way from his palms to his wrists to his biceps to his shoulders. In one dexterous maneuver, he crosses his arms to get at his sides, looking like a man confined to a straitjacket. ''I should drink from another well,'' Mr. Ahsanullah, 45, said. His fingers have lesions the size of chickpeas. His soles are similarly affected, a hazardous problem for a rickshaw puller who goes barefoot. Infected wounds often lead to gangrene. As Mr. Ahsanullah spoke, a small crowd gathered. Some of the men pulled up shirts to show their own dark speckling or lumpy palms. Standing at the front door of a shack was a young woman, Khorsheda Begum, the rickshaw puller's wife. The couple wed three years ago. Their families had arranged the marriage. She had never seen him until the wedding day. Now, sheepishly, she admitted she wished she could undo their union. A village quack has told her -- incorrectly -- that her husband's skin condition is contagious. Actually, the grave danger comes from the tube well in the yard. ''Yes, I drink from it,'' she said. ''We all do.'' Their well is the standard device, a small cylinder sunk into the earth with a hand pump above ground. Its location was familiar to Mostafa Kamal, an engineer who works for an aid agency called Proshika. He had once tested the well and found it contaminated. But for one reason or another, he had never gotten back to Khandkar Kalagachia to assay any other samples. ''Please test our wells now,'' one man pleaded. But the engineer could not comply. He was apologetic. His agency had a contract to examine wells. ''But I only have supplies to test 200 a month and I have run out,'' he said. ''I can request more but I don't think I will get it.'' From the start, the effort to correct the problem has run into problems. The primary mission was the testing of every well. If the water was safe, the top of the well was to be painted green. If not, it would be colored red. This task required test kits that could accurately measure minuscule levels of arsenic, but nothing that precise was immediately available. While it was presumed that every family had a right to know if their well was tainted, little had been decided about how to help the unlucky. ''We started taking the measurements, but as we tested, painting the wells red or green, there was a great hue and cry from people with contaminated water,'' said a government official. ''These people asked us, What do you expect us to do now?'' ''It took us a while to come up with new technologies, such as pond sand filters or rainwater harvesting or, in some areas, deeper tube wells,'' the official said. ''Different areas have different solutions. But once the best one is decided, to whom do you provide the money for installation? How do you prevent corruption?'' Programs were required, and each scheme seemed to call for round after round of design. The World Bank, after lending so much money, wanted the protection of exacting oversight. Some government officials, practiced in steering contracts to cronies, had supervisory interests of their own. ''It has been terrible frustration to watch,'' said Han A. Heijnen, the environmental health adviser for the World Health Organization in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. ''So much remains to be done. Even now, the lack of knowledge among villagers about arsenic is a shame.'' The arsenic itself may well have been in the area's alluvial sediments for 20,000 years or more. Exactly how it came to dissolve in the groundwater is a matter of debate, but the prevailing theory is that it was a natural process. Whatever the cause, the arsenic's belated discovery is at the root of the calamity. Water-quality experts are divided about how much, if any, negligence was involved. Some victims are suing the British Geological Survey, which did not include a test for arsenic when it surveyed the groundwater in 1992. But even after the poison was found, responses were tardy. Unicef is now a dedicated participant in the testing of wells, but it and the government were slow to admit that their ''safe water program,'' the laudable effort to stop people from drinking from disease-laden ponds, had dire unintended consequences. Now, with the disaster continuing, Bangladesh is of great interest to global experts, their laboratory for the study of arsenic. Researchers have questions, among them: Has the poison breached the food chain? Why are some people more affected than others? Is the level of arsenic in each tube well stable? Will fatalistic villagers change their habits? Mr. Ahsanullah, the rickshaw puller, incessantly scratching, had himself given thought to an alternate source of water. Recently, he began using a neighbor's well. ''But now I am told that, too, is bad,'' he said as he stood amid lush greenery and sprawling ponds. Within 20 feet, villagers were sloshing through the shallows that nourished a rice paddy. Still, the confused man, displaying his fear, asked gravely, ''Where can I find water?''"
"ON April 19 the Carnival Corporation pleaded guilty in United States District Court in Miami to criminal charges related to falsifying records of the oil-contaminated bilge water that six of its ships dumped into the sea from 1996 through 2001. A lengthy investigation by more than a half-dozen agencies, from the Coast Guard to the Environmental Protection Agency, found that Carnival engineers circumvented the 1980 Federal Act to Prevent Pollution From Ships by intentionally flushing clean water instead of bilge water past the sensors of oil content meters, which are required on all ships and are designed to register the oil content in the bilge waste. That tricked the meters into measuring the oil in the clean water instead of in the bilge waste, which was dumped, unfiltered, into the sea. The Carnival Corporation was ordered to pay $18 million in fines and perform community service, received five years' probation and must submit to a court-supervised worldwide environmental-compliance program for each of its cruise ships. Carnival, the parent company of Carnival Cruise Line as well as Costa Cruises, Cunard Line, Holland America Line, Seabourn Cruise Line and Windstar Cruises, is not alone in violating environmental rules aimed at the cruise industry. In 1999, for example, Royal Caribbean pleaded guilty to 21 felony violations of federal law for having rigged the pipes on its ships in order to bypass pollution equipment. It also admitted that it illegally discharged dry-cleaning chemicals and other toxic wastes into the waters off Alaska, Puerto Rico and Florida. In recent months, several environmental groups have raised other issues with the cruise industry. Ocean Conservancy, a Washington-based organization that works to protect the oceans, released a report last month accusing the industry of generating more than 400 million pounds of waste annually, and dumping much of it into the ocean. And on April 24, a coalition of four West Coast environmental organizations -- the Bluewater Network, the Environmental Law Foundation, San Diego Baykeeper and the Surfrider Foundation -- filed suit in Los Angeles County Superior Court to force Carnival Corporation (including its Holland America subsidiary), Royal Caribbean and P & O Princess Cruises to comply with the 1999 California law that prohibits ships having left international waters from dumping ballast water within three miles of California's coast. Ballast water -- sea water pumped into the bottom of ships to keep them stable at sea -- can contain aquatic animals and plants caught up in the process. These nonnative organisms can survive in the ballast tanks, said Hiram Sarabia, a scientist for the nonprofit San Diego Baykeeper, and if released into a foreign coastal environment can threaten native species. The cruise lines named in the lawsuit have not yet responded, beyond saying that they do not comment on matters in litigation. But representatives of Carnival responded promptly to questions about its current and future compliance with the federal court's orders. A hot line required by the court so that employees or passengers can report suspected violations of environmental programs or of Carnival's compliance is already operating, a spokesman for Carnival said, ''and people can leave messages either identifying themselves or anonymously.'' James Wheaton, president of the Environmental Law Foundation, said that the coalition's charges had been documented in some 400 of the ballast reports that ships have been required to submit to California's State Lands Commission. He said the commission could impose administrative fines of its own, up to $5,000 per violation per day. Teri Shore, director of the Bluewater Network's Clean Vessels campaign, which advocates cleaner ships and ferries, said, ''There are few federal laws that regulate cruise ships, and the ones that do are not very effective because enforcement is weak, penalties minimal and the cruise ships intentionally violate them in order to cut costs and feed profits. ''Federal law to prevent dumping of oily discharges is routinely ignored, as Carnival has shown,'' she said, ''and the federal ballast-water law is voluntary.'' Michael Crye, president of the International Council of Cruise Lines, whose 16 members include Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Princess, disagrees that the laws are weakly enforced. ''Over the past few years two large cruise lines have been fined over $27 million and $18 million for presenting improperly maintained record books to federal authorities,'' he said. ''These are not minimal penalties, nor weak enforcement.'' Michael Driscoll, editor of Cruise Week, an industry newsletter, said that the publication asked two dozen travel agents shortly after the Carnival verdict whether there would be a negative impact on Carnival's business because of its guilty plea. Most of them said there would be little or none. Felicia Kantor, the senior leisure analyst for Lehman Brothers, said that consumers don't seem to have much incentive to shun cruise lines for violating pollution regulations. ''It may be unfortunate, but at the end of the day a lot of people are thinking about where to go on vacation,'' she said, ''and cruise lines do offer a fairly reasonable and entertaining product.'' TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT"
"It was thought to be a fortunate close call after a grounded tanker disgorged 150,000 gallons of diesel and bunker fuel into the biological richness of the Galápagos Islands in January 2001. Shifting winds sent most of the slick to sea and, as a result, deaths of sea lions and sea birds were in the dozens rather than the hundreds and the islands, which inspired Charles Darwin's ideas of evolution, appeared largely spared. Now, however, biologists conducting a long-term study of the islands' unique marine iguanas say that even the relatively small amount of spilled oil caused the deaths of thousands of iguanas -- on one island, Santa Fe, the iguana population declined from 25,000 to 10,000. Their theory, to be tested in experiments later this year, is that the oil killed bacteria in the guts of the iguanas that allow them to digest seaweed; they starved to death. The algae-eating iguana species, Amblyrhynchus cristatus, is dispersed over many of the dozens of islands and is not in danger of extinction. But the research provides new evidence that small marine oil spills can have far-reaching, and subtle, toxic effects, several marine biologists said. The Galápagos discovery came indirectly from a continuing study in which hundreds of iguanas on two small, similar islands were marked in 1987 and monitored ever since. No other scientists have reported long-term effects on other Galápagos species. The iguana findings are described today in a brief paper in the journal Nature. It follows the release two weeks ago of a study by the National Academy of Sciences that emphasized the threat posed by low concentrations of oil spilled into the sea. One author of that study said the Galápagos findings, though still lacking specific evidence of the toxic effect, were compelling. ''The circumstantial evidence would certainly suggest that oil exposure was a critical factor,'' said the author, Dr. Judith E. McDowell, a zoologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Surveys of iguanas before and after the spill determined that more than 60 percent of the marked animals on Santa Fe -- an island contaminated with about a quart of oil along each yard of its windward shore -- died by the end of 2001. Many iguana skeletons were also recovered along the tide line. No similar die-off happened on Genovesa, an uncontaminated island with a marked iguana population, about 60 miles to the north, according to the researchers. No similar surveys have been taken on the other islands. ''There's nothing else we can imagine that could kill 60 percent of a population,'' said Dr. Martin Wikelski, an ecologist from Princeton University who led the Galápagos study. The marine iguanas of the Galápagos lack natural foes and generally die either of old age or of starvation when periodic El Niño warmings of the eastern Pacific kill off the shallow beds of seaweed they graze on. But the last El Niño warming prior to the spill ended in 1998. Also, iguanas of all sizes died on Santa Fe after the spill, while the natural weather cycles tend to kill mostly large old animals that need the most seaweed. Another hint that something in the diet contributed to the mortality on Santa Fe was a spike in the animals' blood levels of a steroid, corticosterone, that is produced when they face physiological stress. The National Science Foundation has given the research team a grant to return to the islands later this year and run experiments to test the potential toxicity of oil to the lizards' gut bacteria, Dr. Wikelski said. He said national park officials in Ecuador, to which the islands belong, had agreed to the tests, which would involve feeding clean and oil-tainted seaweed to captive animals. The work on the die-off is an undesired shift for Dr. Wikelski, whose main focus had been a 20-year study of the iguanas' behavior and population. He said that study was essentially ruined because so many of the monitored animals died."
"A federal judge found Los Angeles in violation of the Clean Water Act today, holding it liable for 297 sewage spills from January 2001 to July 2002. The ruling by Judge Ronald S. W. Lew of Federal District Court here could result in fines exceeding $8 million -- $27,500 for each spill -- and court-ordered remedies. ''The City of Los Angeles can no longer treat daily sewage spills as business as usual,'' said Steve Fleischli, executive director of the Santa Monica Baykeeper, an environmental group that sued the city about the spills four years ago. ''This sets the stage for liability on thousands of spills.'' In court documents, Baykeeper, which was joined in the suit by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board and several community groups, contends that the city has a ''chronic, continuing and unacceptable number of spills from its sewage collection system.'' From 1993 to January 2002, according to documents, the city reported 3,000 spills from its pipes. ''This isn't a third-world city. We should be able to do a lot better,'' said Fran B. Diamond, chairman of the regional water quality board. Baykeeper said there had been more than 2,000 sewage spills since its suit was filed in 1998 despite negotiations to try to resolve the problem. Of the 297 spills cited in today's hearing, the city conceded to all but 4. In those cases, the city argued that the sewage did not reach water. But Judge Lew found that a spill constituted a violation. A trial is scheduled for early 2004 to address penalties and remedies. Efforts to resolve the case through a negotiated settlement will continue, lawyers said. Adel Hagekhalil, division manager with the city's waste water engineering division, said the city was working to eliminate the problem. He noted that the Board of Public Works, an oversight board appointed by the mayor, had set a goal of reducing spills by 25 percent by 2005. ''We've been working for four years trying to understand the issues,'' Mr. Hagekhalil said, ''trying to find remedies and I think we've been successful in some areas.'' Among the initiatives Mr. Hagekhalil cited was a grease-control program intended for restaurants, which emphasizes cleaning techniques and has enabled the city to reduce grease-caused spills by 30 percent in the last year. He added that the city had spent more than $1 billion in the last 10 years upgrading sewers and planned to spend another $2 billion in the next 10 years for more improvements. Los Angeles has about 6,500 miles of sewers, more than half of which are at least 50 years old. The system is plagued by persistent blockages by grease and roots. The spills typically end up in waterways like the Los Angeles River and Ballona Creek, running into the ocean and fouling beaches. The E.P.A. is also pursuing cases against other cities, including Atlanta, Baltimore, Miami and New Orleans. Still, officials said, Los Angeles has one of the highest sewage spills in the country, averaging two a day. According to Baykeeper, a disproportionate number of spills occur in neighborhoods that have high percentages of African-American and Latino residents. Several homeowner groups have banded to protest the spills."
"The Bush administration announced new standards today for the largest animal feedlots that call for a reduction in water pollution by these operations but allow each farm to write its own plans and to keep them secret from the public. Christie Whitman, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Ann M. Veneman, the agriculture secretary, told reporters that the rule would lead to a 25 percent reduction in the main pollutants created by manure and urine from swine, cattle and chickens raised together in close confinement. ''This is a major step forward to protect our nation's waters,'' Mrs. Whitman said. ''Animal waste from confined animal feed operations pose a real threat to America's rivers and waters.'' Agriculture is the single greatest source of water pollution in the country. Environmental groups that brought a lawsuit in 1989 asking for a review of water pollution standards for feedlots said the new rule was far too vague and amounted to a step backward. The new rule requires the largest concentrated animal feeding operations of at least 1,000 head of cattle, 2,500 hogs or 30,000 broiler chickens to develop a plan to control pollution. The previous standards written 25 years ago allowed for many exceptions and applied to fewer than 5,000 operations. The new standards will apply to some 15,500 operations. Each plan must include proper storage of manure, the removal of dead animals and reduction of the amount of manure used to fertilize fields. Currently many of these operations spray so much manure on fields that the crops produced there are deemed unfit for animals or humans. Mrs. Whitman said the rule would reduce nitrogen released by these farms by 110 million pounds and phosphorus by 56 million pounds, or approximately 25 percent of current levels. That estimate is based on several years of study, she said. But environmentalists complained that the rule had no minimum standards and did not allow public review of plans for individual farms. ''The final rule puts polluters first,'' said Melanie Shepherdson, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which initiated the lawsuit that the group won and that required a new standard this month. ''It's a sweet deal for factory farm polluters, but it stinks for the rest of us.'' Lawyers for her group said they were examining the new rule to challenge it in court. Spokesmen for the hog, cattle and chicken industries said they were pleased with the announcement. Several industries said the new rule would have little effect on most of their farmers. ''Most broiler farms in the country are already operating under nutrient management plans,'' said Steve Pretanik, an official of the National Chicken Council. Other industry groups praised the new rule as a practical solution for most meat operations. ''We applaud the administration for its efforts to make this more palatable, however, we are still concerned about its cost and the impact it will have on the small and mid-size pork producers,'' said Kara Flynn, a spokeswoman for the National Pork Council. This sharp division between agribusiness and environmentalists highlighted the complaint of several small family-farm groups and environmentalists that the new rule was an example of the Bush administration's favoring business over the public interest in issues of health and the environment. But unlike some of the high-profile issues, waste from confined animal feedlots has been literally hidden from view. The meat industry began building huge feedlots in isolated rural areas from North Carolina to California in the 1990's, capturing the waste of hogs and cattle in large manure lagoons and spraying them in nearby fields. The operations were not required to apply for permits or to follow procedures developed for disposing of most human waste, which includes breaking down waste matter and then chlorinating the waste before it is discharged back into rivers. More than 35,000 miles of rivers were polluted by the big feedlots in the past decade, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Few issues are more emotional in rural America. Citizen groups have filed dozens of lawsuits to try to control or evict these feedlots from their counties. Residents contend that feedlots destroy the quality of pastoral life with their odor and threaten the environment and public health with noxious air pollution and seepage of polluted water into drinking and surface water. Ms. Veneman said the 2002 farm bill contained enough money to smooth the way for farmers to adhere to the new rule. But environmentalists disputed that characterization, too, saying the farm bill gave big agribusinesses federal subsidies to clean up the water pollution they created in their huge feedlots."
"The environmental community and the Bush administration are at odds again, this time over proposed changes in a key part of the Clean Water Act. The changes would give states greater leeway in deciding which waterways need to be cleaned and how rapidly to do the job. The administration says that such flexibility is necessary to make the act work. Environmentalists fear yet another rollback of existing protections. The specific regulation at issue is known, forbiddingly, as the T.M.D.L. program -- for total maximum daily load. The Clean Water Act has done an admirable job of regulating so-called end-of-pipe pollution from readily identifiable sources like factories and waste treatment plants. The T.M.D.L. regulation is aimed at controlling polluted runoff from more diffuse sources like farms, timber operations and city streets. This runoff is the main reason that 40 percent of the country's waters -- some 20,000 rivers, lakes and estuaries altogether -- are still too polluted for fishing or swimming. The regulation asks each state to assess the health of every body of water within its borders, assign maximum allowable levels of pollution for each one, and then regulate individual polluters. Rules established in 2000 by the Clinton administration gave states up to 15 years to set maximum pollution levels and a decade more to do the cleanup. Despite this exceedingly generous timetable there were howls from various interest groups, especially farmers, and serious objections in Congress. With an eye to defusing this opposition, the administration would give states even greater flexibility. Among other things, changes now under consideration would stress ''voluntary efforts'' and could well raise the scientific threshold for what constitutes polluted waters. The administration says scientific accuracy is necessary to insure that resources are properly targeted. Environmentalists fear that the search for the perfect numerical rationale will result in endless delays. On Oct. 18 the Clean Water Act will celebrate its 30th anniversary. There are better ways to mark that occasion than by weakening what has arguably been the most successful of all the landmark environmental statutes passed in the late 1960's and early 1970's."
"Shrouded by a dense fog, the vast white vessel slid silently into the bay this morning and anchored far from shore, like a ghost ship unwilling to be noticed. Off the stern, a pair of young sea lions cavorted, tracing arcs in the air, oblivious to their role in the commotion the cruise ship's visit has caused here since it was announced earlier this year. When Royal Caribbean, owner of the vessel that came in today and and two other companies announced plans to make Monterey a port of call this year, stewards of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, one of the world's most diverse aquatic ecosystems, shuddered. They had visions of crew members tossing trash overboard and disgorging oily bilge water and sewage, practices for which some companies have paid heavy fines elsewhere. In an April meeting here, representatives from environmental organizations, the city, the state and the sanctuary told the cruise lines that if they could not refrain from soiling the waters of the bay, they should stay away. So the cruise lines agreed in writing, apparently for the first time anywhere, not to discharge anything, not even the relatively innocuous effluence that the law allows. ''From the ship's master to its crew, every effort is made to ensure that we are good stewards of our ocean environment and of all the ports we visit,'' William S. Wright, a senior vice president at Royal Caribbean, wrote to a California water quality official on May 28. As wary travelers forsake journeys abroad after Sept. 11, more cruise ships are plying more United States ports. In most places, the economic benefit of such visits precludes any complaints. Not here. Even today, a small contingent of protesters convened at Fisherman's Wharf, concerned that Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the Seas, the first of the super-sized cruise ships to debark passengers here, would foul the waters of the bay. ''If cruise ships are allowed to dump anything, they usually dump everything,'' said Kaitilin Gaffney, a program manager for the Ocean Conservancy, an organization based in Washington that works to protect the oceans, and abroker of the agreement reached here, who watched from Fisherman's Wharf as the Grandeur of the Seas' 1,800 passengers debarked from local boats chartered to take them to shore. ''Given their history of dumping garbage in backyards all over,'' Ms. Gaffney said, referring to cruise ships in general, ''we're quite pleased.'' Royal Caribbean was fined $28 million in 1998 and 1999 after Coast Guard investigators discovered, in what prosecutors described as a fleet-wide practice, that its engineers had rigged illegal plumbing lines to bypass equipment designed to take oil out of bilge water that was about to be dumped at sea. From 1993 to 1998, cruise ships were found to have caused at least 87 illegal discharges of trash, oil and hazardous wastes into American waters and paid more than $30 million in fines, according to Bluewater Network, a San Francisco environmental organization. Twelve of the cases were in California. Thomas M. Dow, a spokesman for Princess Cruises, one of five cruise lines accused by environmental groups in an April lawsuit of dumping untreated ballast water into California waters, said the discussions with the townspeople here allowed the company to understand their worries about pollution. ''We pretty quickly came to realize that this is what most concerned them,'' Mr. Dow said, ''and that we could operate within those restrictions.'' Tom Greene, director of safety, environment and training for Crystal Cruises, which plans to dispatch its 790-foot Crystal Harmony to Monterey on Oct. 9, said company officials had promised to withhold all liquid and solid waste water while in Monterey Bay. Even though a company policy forbids such dumping, Mr. Greene said the company wanted to reassure local officials in writing that it would abide by their demands. In November last year, Crystal Cruises was one of six cruise lines that agreed to settlements of $41,250 to $247,500 for a variety of charges concerning excessive smokestack emissions in the port of Juneau, Alaska, over the previous two summers. The first of the three ships scheduled this year for Monterey, the 950-foot, 18-deck Star Princess, with 4,000 passengers and crew members, anchored offshore on May 7 but did not debark passengers because of choppy seas, a disappointment to local business owners. In 2000, the cruise industry contributed almost $18 billion to the American economy and generated more than 257,000 jobs, according to the Ocean Conservancy. The industry is growing by more than 8 percent a year. ''They've been telling us not to throw things overboard,'' said Margaret Alford, a passenger on the 900-foot Grandeur of the Seas, which made its Monterey stopover as part of a trip of California ports and Mexico. ''They're even telling us to use our towels twice, to save water.'' Visitors today took in not only the salty-dog seafood snack joints on Fisherman's Wharf, among other things, but Cannery Row, made famous in the John Steinbeck novel of the same name. For many, the area's jewel is the marine sanctuary, which encompasses 5,322 square miles of ocean and is celebrating its 10th anniversary this week. It is believed to house 27 species of whales, dolphins and other marine mammals, 94 species of sea birds and about 345 fish species. The whiskered sea otters, in particular, are much admired, not least for their custom of cracking shellfish open on their bellies while floating on their backs."
"An oil barge carrying two million gallons of home heating fuel ran aground early this morning in Long Island Sound, puncturing at least four of its dozen compartments and spilling some 2,500 gallons of light-grade oil, the Coast Guard said. Officials said the spill, which created a slick 50 yards wide by 2,000 yards long, posed little risk to the environment and would probably not wash up on either side of the sound. ''We would consider it a relatively minor spill,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Dan Allman of the Coast Guard in New Haven. By late afternoon, the commander said the spill had been contained and no additional oil appeared to be leaking. ''Twenty five hundred gallons were spilled, and of that, we estimate 200 gallons remain out there,'' said Petty Officer John Olsen. Commander Allman said it was too soon to assess the potential damage to shellfish beds. He said officials expected the remaining oil to be transferred to another barge within 24 hours. The barge, owned by Hornbeck Offshore Transportation of Mandeville, La., had loaded in New York Harbor near Linden, N.J., with 52,000 barrels of No. 2 home heating oil. It was scheduled to dock in Port Jefferson, N.Y. The barge, which was being pulled by a tugboat called North Service, was about two miles south of Norwalk when it struck ground shortly before 2 a.m. The barge was able to keep moving, and later anchored about a quarter mile away in 40 feet of water, officials said. Two Coast Guard vessels immediately responded to the scene of the spill, and a Coast Guard helicopter flew overhead at first light to film the slick and assess the spill's size. Local, state and federal environmental officials also responded. Carl G. Annessa, the vice president and chief operating officer of Hornbeck Offshore Transportation, said the barge was traveling a familiar route. ''We make the trip from New York Harbor to Port Jefferson many, many, many times a month,'' he said. There were no injuries to the crew, he said. Mr. Annessa said the company immediately activated an emergency plan, contacting the Coast Guard as well as an environmental clean-up company called the National Response Corporation to coordinate the unloading of the remaining oil from the damaged barge. The slick was contained by a floating boom. Mr. Annessa said the company transports 50 million to 70 million barrels of oil a year and has an ''impeccable'' safety record. This was its worst accident. ''We're heartsick over the whole circumstance,'' he said. ''I am thankful that the risk to the environment is minimal.''"
"New clean water regulations requiring small construction sites to develop plans for storm water will not apply to the oil and gas industries, officials of the Environmental Protection Agency said today. The new rules, which take effect on Monday, will require construction sites bigger than one acre to have plans to handle storm water, which can carry chemical and metal runoff from the disturbed soil. Existing rules already require such plans for sites larger than five acres. The agency says it is giving the oil and gas industries a two-year exemption from the requirement at the smaller sites while it conducts further study. Critics in national environmental groups and in Congress say the oil and gas industries are taking advantage of close ties to the administration to lay political groundwork for broader exemptions to the Clean Water Act. John Millett, an environmental agency spokesman, said the agency had received conflicting information about the environmental impact of oil and gas construction sites. ''It's different because of its short time frame compared to other construction,'' Mr. Millet said, adding that the agency did not have enough data to properly understand how the rule would affect the oil and gas industries. ''All that information right now is residential and commercial construction.'' ''Oil and gas differs sufficiently enough to warrant further evaluation,'' he said. Since 1990, construction sites, including oil and gas facilities, that are larger than five acres or in more densely populated areas have been required to obtain permits. Oil construction sites larger than five acres often dealt with the regulation by building ponds to collect the storm water and soil runoff. Senator James M. Jeffords, independent of Vermont, the ranking minority member of the Environmental and Public Works Committee, criticized the exemption. ''While small communities and small construction projects in every other sector of the economy must comply with strong storm water standards,'' Mr. Jeffords said, ''the Bush administration is giving a free ride to the oil and gas industry.'' Mr. Jeffords is one of six senators who have sparred with the agency since the exemption was proposed on Dec. 30. The agency said that when it proposed the original rule in 1999, it assumed that ''few, if any'' oil and gas production and treatment sites would be affected. Instead, the agency said, it has discovered that 30,000 oil and gas sites a year could be affected. ''New information came to light that necessitated re-evaluation of oil and gas construction activities,'' said Mr. Millet, the agency's spokesman. But in a letter to agency's administrator, Christie Whitman, the six senators say there is ''voluminous evidence'' of an oil and gas industry review before the rule was created in 1999. They also dispute the 30,000 number, saying that industry number is inflated because it includes offshore and onshore construction sites alike. The data also does not break down the construction sites by size, so it is unclear how many of those 30,000 sites would actually be affected, they said. In addition, they noted that the data that the agency said had come to light had been collected by the federal government since 1973 and available since 1978."
"A ruptured sewage pipe serving most of central New Jersey is diverting 2.5 million gallons of raw sewage into upper New York Harbor each hour, closing shellfish beds and threatening the health of Raritan Bay and nearby waters into the summer. Officials of the Middlesex County Utilities Authority, which operates the sewage system, said they did not know how long repairing the break would take or how long the sewage would flow into the bay. ''This is the about the worst thing that can happen in our business,'' said Richard L. Fitamant, executive director of the authority. The pipe, eight and a half feet in diameter, broke early Sunday morning because of a chain of events that started when electricity to a pumping station was briefly interrupted, Mr. Fitamant said. The break does not affect the quality of drinking water, he said. Commissioner Bradley M. Campbell of the Department of Environmental Protection issued an appeal to the roughly 750,000 homes and commercial users of the system in Middlesex, Union and Somerset Counties to reduce their use of water. The department halted shellfish harvesting in the region's 30,000 acres of shellfish beds, leaving the baymen, already idled by a harsh winter, unable to work as the weather turned warm. ''We're already two months behind because of the winter, and now we're losing more ground,'' said Jude Welsh, a clam digger. ''If this lasts past Friday, a lot of us are going to have to start looking for other jobs.'' The break also is a blow to the river estuaries and the lower bay, which has begun to recover from centuries of contamination, said Andrew J. Willner, who has the title of baykeeper for the American Littoral Society, an advocacy group for the shore area's waters. ''This is an estuary in recovery, and when you get an event of this size, it really throws that recovery back,'' Mr. Willner said. The break occurred next to a large apartment complex here, and the sewer utility was at work digging the broken pipe or pipes and pumping the sewage left in them into tankers. Mr. Fitamant said that he had only one replacement section of pipe and that securing more pipe would delay repairs. The sewer authority said it believed that the break was caused by a water hammer that formed as the pumps at the Sayreville pumping station briefly stopped and the sewage in the two-mile-long pipe began flowing back downhill. Once the break occurred, the authority shifted most of the flow to an older, unused line, six feet in diameter, parallel to the broken main. But the smaller pipe could not carry as much waste as the big pipe, particularly with the weekend rains and melting snow. The difference between the total volume of waste and the capacity of the smaller pipe is flowing into Raritan Bay and beyond. Mr. Willner, the baykeeper, said the effects of the flood of waste into the bay would last into summer. The bacteria that break down the sewage will reduce oxygen levels in the bay, while nutrients from the sewage will aid the growth of algae. The baymen gathered at their docks in Highlands, a few miles south of here, and spoke ruefully about having struggled through a hard winter only to run into a new delay. ''Last week we went out in a 14-degree wind chill, icicles hanging from the gunwales to the water, so cold we had to put the clams in saltwater to keep them from freezing,'' said William Dean, a bayman. ''And at the end of the day we were still laughing, we were so happy just to be working.'' Mr. Welsh finished his thought, ''And now this.''"
"Officials in Monterey have banned a cruise ship from its harbor after learning that it had dumped thousands of gallons of wastewater in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary last October despite a pledge that it would not. At a City Council meeting on Tuesday evening, Fred Meurer, the city manager, said the Crystal Harmony, a 940-passenger ship that visited Monterey on Oct. 9, had discharged about 36,400 gallons of wastewater as it headed south off the coast of Big Sur, near a sea otter refuge. ''The Crystal Harmony is no longer welcome in Monterey,'' Carl Anderson, the city's public facilities director, said in an interview today. ''We mean business and will do whatever it takes to protect our sanctuary.'' Crystal Cruises, the ship's owner, did not report the dumping until Feb. 27, said Michael W. Coleman, a company spokesman, and then only as part of a quarterly report requested by state water regulators. Asked why the incident had not been acknowledged earlier, Mr. Coleman said there was ''no requirement to report it.'' However, Mr. Coleman said, the cruise company fired the ship's chief officer, who was the watch officer that night. ''He simply failed to remember that we were in the middle of the sanctuary,'' Mr. Coleman said. ''Every single member of our crew is aware of our environmental policies. We have a wonderful, wonderful track record.'' In November 2001, Crystal was one of six cruise lines that agreed to settlements of $41,250 to $247,500 for a variety of charges concerning excessive smokestack emissions off Juneau, Alaska. From 1993 to 1998, cruise lines paid more than $30 million in fines for 87 illegal discharges of trash, oil and hazardous wastes in United States waters. Given that record, officials in Monterey last year elicited from Crystal and two other cruise lines written promises that they would not dump trash or discharge any dirty or contaminated water into the 5,322-square-mile sanctuary, which is home to 27 species of whales, dolphins and other marine mammals. ''Crystal Harmony will observe a no-discharge policy in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary in conjunction with the Oct. 9 visit,'' Joseph L. Valenti, the company's senior vice president for marine operations, wrote in May 29 letter to the California Regional Water Quality Control Board. ''This policy will apply to all wastewater, ballast water, water discharged through the oily water separator, and all forms of solid waste.'' Instead, some 14 miles offshore on its way to Acapulco, the 790-foot Crystal Harmony discharged about 34,078 gallons of gray water, 264 gallons of treated black water, and 2,118 gallons of processed bilge water, the company said. Gray water is produced from kitchens, showers and sinks, black water refers to contamination from human waste, and bilge water, which usually carries oil and other engine room lubricants, is pumped out of a ship's hull. ''We feel terrible,'' Mr. Coleman said. The cruise line has scheduled no visits to Monterey this year or next by any of its other ships, he said, a decision unrelated to the controversy over the Crystal Harmony, which was bound for Los Angeles today after a seven-day trip to ports in Mexico. ''This incident makes perfectly clear that voluntary assurances are not enough,'' said Kaitilin Gaffney, a Santa Cruz-based program manager for the Ocean Conservancy. ''We need regulation, we need monitoring, we need enforcement.'' The Crystal Harmony was one of three cruise ships that visited Monterey last year. The other two were the Star Princess, which anchored offshore on May 7 but did not debark its 4,000 passengers because of choppy seas, and the Grandeur of the Seas, which arrived in thick fog on Sept. 18 with 900 passengers. No dumping incidents were reported from either one. On March 16, a Celebrity Cruises vessel, the Mercury, is to anchor off Monterey in the first of 13 visits scheduled this year. Last week, in a letter to the city's harbor master, the company agreed not to discharge contaminated water in the sanctuary."
"IT did not rain once during the first three months I lived in Northern California. In fact, the weather was so relentlessly sunny and warm in my town that my friends back east began to doubt the truthfulness of my relentlessly chirpy reports (We got sunburned on a hike yesterday while you were shoveling snow, etc.). I figured my days of worrying about winter storms were over. Then the rains started. In December, a heavy, obstinate downpour lasted for days. Accompanied by lashing winds that toppled trees all over town, the storm knocked out the power at the middle school, rattled windowpanes and flooded one of the main roads near the highway. That storm was not an isolated event. During the second storm, one of my neighbors who lost power sent me three shopping bags of frozen food to baby-sit for a week. On Day Three of this storm, I pulled on rubber boots to slog through puddles to the grocery store and overheard another shopper discuss her troubles.''Six days with no electricity,'' she told the cashier. ''And when I called PG&E this morning, they swore they already restored my electricity yesterday.'' That night, I came home from the movies to find trails of red candle wax all over the floors. The air was cloying. Sandalwood? Did a religious cult hold a meeting here while I was gone? I asked my husband. ''We lost the electricity for a while,'' he explained. ''The only light I could find was a votive candle.'' We're the kind of family that misplaced the flashlight a long time ago. With more winter storms ahead, we needed to reform. So I figured the easiest thing to do would be to buy a ready-made emergency kit online from one of the many Internet retailers -- including Exploration Products (www.epcamps.com), iprepare.com and Safety Central (safetycentral .com) -- that specialize in assembling a single package that contains all the items a person might need to survive if municipal services were disrupted for up to three days. At the Exploration Products site, for example, the $21.95 one-person emergency survival kit contains more than 30 items (including food rations, emergency drinking water in a bag and a chemical light stick). And before the kits fiveyear shelf life is up, the site will send a customer an e-mail reminder to replace expired products, said Tim Myhre, the president of Exploration Products. But as I browsed among the possibilities, I realized that this shopping trip could get really expensive, really fast. For my family of five, for example, Iprepare.coms Deluxe home/office five-person emergency kit cost $155 and included such items as 50 water purification tablets, latex gloves and a portable toilet. At Exploration Products, the five-person family survival kit contained even more products (250 items including alcohol wipes, dust masks, splints, a pry bar and playing cards), weighed in at 35 pounds and cost $299.95. And at Safety Central, a Small Business/Family Emergency Support Unit for Five People for Three Days kit was $439. Would my family really need tongue depressors (included in Safety Centrals kit)? On one hand, I didn't want to shortchange safety because of stinginess. On the other, I couldn't really see the urgency of a fresh deck of playing cards. Still, by now I was feeling pretty tense. I had started this process as an innocent, thinking more along the lines of an extra flashlight and a new pack of batteries than of a disaster scenario that could catapult my family into an unsheltered lifestyle of contaminated water and ready-made meal rations. But as I browsed, I couldnt avoid the implications of the BurnAid First Aid Burn Gel ($3.95 at earthquakestore .com), or of a gas mask with a fullface lens ($179.95 at the Emergency Preparedness Center at areyouprepared.com). A Mitsubishi portable generator ($575 including shipping) at Southwest Supply's Generator Superstore at southwestfastener.com started to sound like a necessity. For guidance, I phoned Doug Ritter, a survival specialist who operates the Internet site Equipped to Survive (equipped.org), which reviews emergency equipment. ''I started out believing that my worst-case scenario was a freezer full of melted ice cream,'' I said. ''Now I dont know what to think. You know,'' and here I paused dramatically, ''I live in earthquake country.'' Mr. Ritter, who clearly had some experience with calming the near hysterical, told me to stay focused on my original intent. ''What you are trying to prepare for is to be able to take care of yourself and your loved ones during the first hours -- historical experience tells us thats 72 hours -- when government and volunteer services may not be able to respond as fully or quickly as anyone would like,'' he said. With that in mind, the essentials for a three-day kit are water and shelter, he said: ''That's not to say there aren't significant advantages to having food and medical supplies and the rest, but in terms of priority, they come second after the most basic essentials.'' Based on his advice, I made a list. It included water (one gallon per person per day), plastic garbage bags that can double as tarps or ponchos), waterproof matches, candles, a high-quality flashlight and plenty of batteries. There's actually a benefit to assembling those basics on your own -- at least for the kind of family that has a history of absent-mindedly losing the flashlight. ''Put the stuff into a container and seal it, and that way you'll have a reminder that you don't want to be taking anything out of there unless it's an emergency,'' Mr. Ritter said. ''It's very important that you don't want to be hunting around for this stuff if you need it.'' In the end, I bought most of the items on my list at the supermarket or a local hardware store. But when it came to a flashlight -- a solid, waterproof model -- I was pickier. I ended up ordering two of Pelican's Super Pelilite model. Although I saw it for sale on several sites, the best deal I found was at sailnet.com ($18.95 apiece and free shipping). I ordered batteries from the comprehensive batteries.com, a site I like for its organization (you can search in subcategories like rechargeables, dog collar and hearing aid). The red votive candle I haven't replaced yet. ONLINE SHOPPER E-mail: Slatalla@nytimes.com"
"After bringing hundreds of polluted sites into compliance with regulatory standards in the last decade, the Environmental Protection Agency has learned that a contaminant found at many of those sites may be more harmful than previously thought. As a result, the agency is scrambling to re-evaluate its cleanup efforts. In Silicon Valley, where the E.P.A. is focusing its initial checks, one house has already been fitted with new ventilation to prevent the buildup of gases from the residue of the contaminant, a powerful solvent used to clean electronic components, particularly computer microprocessors. The contaminant, trichloroethylene, or TCE, has for years been known to cause cancer as well as respiratory, liver and lung damage. But in December, the environmental agency published new research concluding that it was 5 to 65 times as toxic as previously thought, with pregnant women and other sensitive populations being most at risk. Elizabeth Adams, the acting branch chief at the agency's Superfund division for several Western states, including California, said there was concern that the contaminant might be making its way into the air in unsafe amounts. ''If there are buildings over shallow groundwater, there's a potential for vapors to move from the soil and collect inside buildings,'' Ms. Adams said. ''There is not a short-term risk, but we want to make sure there's no long-term risk.'' Ms. Adams said the agency faced a significant task, however, because of the sheer number of sites involved. Of the nation's 1,499 Superfund sites -- cleaned, not yet cleaned or in various stages of cleanup -- one-third to one-half are contaminated with TCE, she said, and regional E.P.A. officials around the country have been told to explore the problem. She said she did not know how many of the sites now had houses or businesses built on them. The finding of added toxicity will ''reopen a lot of different sites'' to cleanup, said Lenny Siegel, executive director of the Center for Public Environmental Oversight, a watchdog group in Mountain View, Calif., in the heart of Silicon Valley. ''Cleanups have been implemented or on their way to being implemented based on the old standard.'' The E.P.A. has focused initially on Silicon Valley not only because of the solvent's common use as a microprocessor cleaner but also because the area has a high concentration of shallow groundwater. The drinking-water supply is not considered under threat, but there is a concern about the chemical's vaporizing out of the groundwater and perhaps being drawn into homes and businesses. That can happen naturally. But part of the problem may lie in existing cleanup procedures, which entail using machines that absorb groundwater and process it to remove TCE. The resulting vapor emitted by the machines has traces of the chemical, though until the new research was published, the amount was not considered harmful. Ms. Adams said that among other things, regional E.P.A. officials were evaluating whether the volume of the chemical given off by the machines at various sites was still considered safe. Four sites are being examined in Silicon Valley. Three, including Moffett Federal Airfield, a former Navy base, are Superfund sites. The other, formerly home to an electronics and communications equipment plant of GTE Government Systems, is being cleaned up under another federal effort, authorized by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Three housing developments built in the mid-1990's now lie on this other, 60-acre site. Ms. Adams said the environmental agency had taken samples at seven houses there and found that the TCE level at one exceeded standards that the agency has proposed as a result of the new research. A second site, contaminated during the 1960's and 1970's by companies including Intel, Raytheon and Fairchild, is now home to commercial developments whose tenants include Netscape, Nokia and Veritas, E.P.A. officials said. Tests there are continuing. At Moffett Federal Airfield, now a NASA property, the Navy took groundwater and soil samples this month, and in several vacant houses found TCE in excess of the environmental agency's proposed new standards. The Navy has not yet looked at the TCE levels in houses that the military is still using there. The service is concerned that the results of such tests could be skewed by the residents' use of household cleaning products, said Lawrence Lansdale, a Navy environmental coordinator. Complicating matters, Mr. Lansdale said, is that no TCE was found in the groundwater beneath some vacant houses in which the chemical was discovered. He said this raised a possibility that the contaminant had been spread from some other source, though he declined to speculate as to what that might have been."
"The Caldwell Trucking Superfund site, a few miles west of the Willowbrook Mall, is a nine-acre repository of poison-laced sewage, hauled here and dumped until the 1970's, when the threat of drinking-water contamination was recognized. About 50 private wells and two public wells had to be shut down, and even more drinking water was threatened as contamination spread toward the Passaic River. The contamination has now mostly been contained, but the latest cleanup stage has progressed fitfully at best. And so three years ago, the federal Environmental Protection Agency started a daring project to pump into the ground a mysterious and little-understood bacterium that munches on the type of pollutants to be found here. By all accounts, the use of the half-micron-long bacterium with the official name Dehalococcoides ethenogenes has been a success. Technically, the bacterium -- a few thousand could fit on the head of a pin -- ingests the toxic chemicals the way that people breathe oxygen. ''It looks like the process is really working,'' said Tom Porucznik, remedial project manager for the E.P.A. The agency will be looking at more results throughout the fall, and will likely decide sometime in the spring whether to continue with the treatment. The bacterium was discovered in 1997 by a team of scientists at Cornell University. They found that it had a strange natural affinity for devouring dangerous industrial chemicals like the one found at Caldwell Trucking -- trichlorethylene, or TCE, which was often used as a heavy cleaner and is suspected of being a carcinogen. The bacteria have an unusual cell wall, and are tiny even by bacterial standards. ''They're really weird organisms,'' said Dr. Stephen H. Zinder, the chairman of the microbiology department at Cornell University. Using the ''bugs'' -- as both he and others refer to D. ethenogenes -- is a vast improvement over the pump-and-treat method, a tactic used at many polluted sites that essentially pumps water to the surface in the hope of removing contamination. ''The bugs flow where the contamination is, because they're following the water,'' said Peter Herzberg, a lawyer for eight companies responsible for the cleanup at the Caldwell site. ''And you're getting to places where you couldn't get to mechanically with a pump-and-treat system.'' Once they get where they are going, the bugs find the TCE or other poisons and begin devouring the chlorines from the molecules, leaving as a byproduct a harmless substance called ethene. The procedure, called bioremediation, has been used in pilot programs in California, Delaware, Texas and elsewhere to battle potential groundwater contaminants. Many sites lie near Air Force bases, where a mixture of jet fuel and TCE often seeped into the ground. Here, scientists and government officials have watched with surprise as the bacterium has significantly reduced the levels of TCE, in some places by 90 to 95 percent. To those who may wonder about replacing poisons with bacteria in groundwater, officials and scientists say that thus far they see no ill effects. David W. Major, a scientist for GeoSyntec, a company that produces a widely used strain of the bacteria used at the site, said that once the feeding of D. ethenogenes stops, the organism simply dies, with little impact on the environment. Still, Dr. Zinder of Cornell, who along with James M. Gossett discovered the organism, said that unintended consequences were always a possibility. ''I'd say, you never know for sure, which makes people nervous,'' he said, ''but I think as technologies go, I wouldn't consider these pathogens. There's just no evidence.'' In fact, over the past decade, bioremediation has been used a number of times. Fertilizer has been used to attack oil spills. In phytoremediation, plants are used to clean up toxic metals. On a clear, bright day, a little chilly by early October standards, a single propeller plane passes overhead on its way to Essex County Airport, and it seems that little is detectably wrong at this nine-acre spot in northern New Jersey. But the whine of a generator and the site of seven milky-white 55-gallon drums rising from the ground quickly dispel that notion. These drums are a kind of feed bag for the bacteria. Each day, Joe Huffman, a geologist, sends a concoction of nutrients, including lactate, into the ground. ''It's like a buffet for the homeless,'' he said. Chris Young, a project manager for the site, is stomping over what was once the ''central lagoon,'' where the heaviest contamination from the septic sludge remains. Now, millions of poison-munching bacteria are burrowing into the soil's convoluted pathways where only a bacterium can go. ''In those tortuous paths,'' Mr. Young said, ''we're just trying to get these nutrients down, get them feeding the organism in place, and get these populations growing.'' Obviously, the more they increase, the more they eat."
"When Dr. Praveen Chaudhari was appointed director of the Brookhaven National Laboratory last winter, he took over a vast research organization that was at once distinguished and troubled. For much of the 1950's and 1960's, the 5,300-acre center operated for the Atomic Energy Commission (since absorbed by the Department of Energy) was a star in the federal research laboratory system and an international leader in particle and atomic physics. But by the 1990's, Brookhaven administrators found themselves embroiled in a series of damaging disputes with local political figures over environmental practices at the laboratory. The controversies reached critical mass in 1997 when one of Brookhaven's three nuclear reactors was discovered to be leaking radioactive tritium. A second reactor, inactive since 1969, was also discharging radioactive contaminants in the soil and ground water. In the furor that followed, the Department of Energy responded to community pressure and shut down the leaking reactor citing economic and not environmental reasons. In 2000, Brookhaven officials shut down a third reactor, a small one used in medical research. After the closings, much of the neutron-scattering science was moved to laboratories elsewhere. Since then, a war of resentment has simmered between some Brookhaven researchers who say the reactor closings were unreasonable and activists who view the laboratory as an insensitive neighbor. The man now in charge of Brookhaven hails from the comparatively tranquil world of private industry. Before accepting the Brookhaven post, succeeding Dr. John H. Marburger III, now President Bush's chief science adviser, Dr. Chaudhari was a vice president at I.B.M. He directed its scientific research and engaged in a fair amount of scientific investigation himself. A materials scientist educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dr. Chaudhari filed some 22 patents while at I.B.M., including one for the erasable read-write compact discs now commonly used to burn music. ''Brookhaven has a very rich history, and it has the potential to become one of the foremost laboratories in the world,'' Dr. Chaudhari said, sitting in his modernistic office on the Brookhaven campus. ''I see all of this potential there, and I know it can be molded to do superb science.'' Q. We've heard you were recruited for this job by an employment service. Is that true? A. Yes. A woman called me one morning at I.B.M. to say that the Brookhaven directorship was open. I thought she was asking me to recommend a possible candidate. ''No,'' she said, ''we were thinking about you.'' I was stunned. They'd been looking for someone for a year. Q. What was it about heading Brookhaven that intrigued you? A. Like many people at private labs and at universities, I had this preconception of the national labs as places where second-class science was being done. I thought, If that is true, then here is an opportunity to try something challenging. Q. Among federal researchers, Brookhaven has a reputation as a corner of the federal laboratory system without a clear mission or identity. The weapons labs like Los Alamos are known for their weapons, Fermilab for particle physics. Is Brookhaven a laboratory in search of an identity? A. I wouldn't characterize it that way. Ours is a multipurpose lab. Brookhaven is probably the world's best high-energy nuclear physics lab. They've discovered here this new state of matter we believe probably existed in the first microsecond of the Big Bang. There's also a great strength at Brookhaven in medical imaging and we also have the world's most-used light source. There are many other areas, homeland security, for instance, where we are strong. We're working on protecting New York City with sensors that would detect nuclear materials. Q. Going back to the events of the late 1990's, do you have any sympathy for the community concerns over the nuclear reactors? A. I've spoken to many people of divergent points of view, and the one consistent view is, The closing of the reactors was not commensurate with what actually happened. Now, if I was a neighbor of Brookhaven, not knowing what was going on and suddenly learning that something will be coming my way in my drinking water, or in my soil, I'd worry about it, too. And I might respond in a certain way. But the newspapers got involved, and they had a story to write. The net result was that it all spiraled out of proportion. Q. One of your predecessors here as director, the Nobel physicist Leon Lederman, claims that a downside to this job is having to confer with endless Energy Department officials, whom he describes as more interested in ''safety, procurement, administrative details, security'' than scientific achievements. Is he right? A. I think that the D.O.E. has a very interesting way of dealing with the national labs. They have an area office over here where you have the folks who observe what we do. We have regular meetings with the Washington office, the local D.O.E. office and another office in Chicago. So there are three D.O.E. offices that we interact with. Now I certainly understand the value of safety and the environment. Particularly given our history at this lab, we have to be very careful. As far as environment is concerned, I think it's important that scientists, of all people, should respect the environment. They understand nature. They know how complex and beautiful nature is. So you have to respect it. I don't find environmental constraints irritating, at all. Q. What about the new security constraints? Since 9/11, security has been stricter around the various national laboratories. Several scientists have complained to me that these restrictions cut the national labs off from the public, create fear about what is going on within them and undermine attempts by scientists to build bridges to the public. A. No, we've got radioactive material in this lab. We can't have people wandering around, picking it up and walking away. We worry about that and so we have to protect the lab and safeguard it. That's part of homeland security. So if you see more guards these days at the gate, it's for that reason. It doesn't stop science. It doesn't stop people from coming in. Q. On a quite different subject, how did you come to invent that bane of copyright lawyers, the erasable read-write compact discs on which music can be burned? A. We were looking for ideas for storage on computers at I.B.M. that were different from what was conventionally being used. That was in the 1970's. The idea that we eventually used had already been discussed, but there was no practical implementation of the idea. So my two colleagues and I, we were working on this alternate storage technology called magnetic bubble storage. One afternoon, we were in a bar talking about the difficulties of that technology. We wondered if we couldn't try it a different way, one that we weren't even certain was possible within the laws of nature. So we went back to the lab and did an experiment. We were trying to build a material which would have a special sense of direction. Yet the material we were choosing -- glass -- by definition, had no sense of direction. Well, it worked. Q. As the co-inventor of the read-write disc technology, are you a rich man? A. No. I.B.M. owns the patents. Q. Do you ever use your own read-write discs? A. I don't use it at all. I'm not into mobile music. If I listen to music, that's what I do. Q. Many of the scientists working in American laboratories are originally from Asia. Do you have any insight on why this scientific immigration wave has come to be a reality? A. I can't tell you about China, but in India, it's well known that you can go to the U.S. and do well. The reason most South Asians come is because they hear in the newspaper about all the great things that are possible, the jobs, the lack of discrimination, so it builds up. Q. Are opportunities for people outside the United States opening up here because many native-born Americans don't study math and science anymore? A. I think some of it is because American kids grow up in a society where money is greatly valued. Since they have many options open to them, they move toward professions where they can do that. Science is not something you associate with making money. In developing countries like India, science is looked at as noble and important. If someone wins a prize, their picture is in the newspapers and they are photographed with the prime minister. Kids follow that and it gives them a sense that this is something they'd like to do. Q. What is one big difference between being an I.B.M. vice president and being a director of a federal laboratory? A. I had one boss there. Here I have five. A CONVERSATION WITH: PRAVEEN CHAUDHARI"
"The collapse of the Bush administration's efforts to enact energy legislation this year revealed a fierce dispute over proposed concessions to Texas companies that produce a gasoline additive that makes drinking water smell like turpentine. Representative Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas and the House majority leader, and Representatives Billy Tauzin of Louisiana and Joe L. Barton of Texas, both Republicans, fought hard to include a section in the bill that would have immunized a handful of companies in and around Houston that produce the additive -- methyl tertiary butyl ether, a substance commonly referred to as M.T.B.E. -- from product-defect lawsuits. Municipal governments in 17 states, including California, New York and Massachusetts, have filed such suits against makers of the additive, seeking billions of dollars in damages so public authorities can start ridding groundwater supplies of the substance. The bill would have retroactively exempted the companies from such suits and required cities to prove negligence by the manufacturers, a much harder task than proving that a product is defective. M.T.B.E. has been added to gasoline in many states since the 1970's, first to increase the octane rating and later to make the fuel burn more cleanly. The largest makers of the additive, including Lyondell Chemical, Huntsman Chemical and Texas Petrochemicals, are based in or near Mr. DeLay's Houston district. Another big manufacturer, Valero Energy, is based in San Antonio. Mr. DeLay insisted that the energy legislation include a provision to protect manufacturers of M.T.B.E. from lawsuits filed after Sept. 5; more than 130 suits have been filed since then. As a sweetener to Democratic opponents from farm states, the bill would have increased the use of ethanol, a corn-based additive, in gasoline, and would have banned M.T.B.E. by 2015, while also providing $2 billion in transition financing to help the companies shift to other products. The concessions to the M.T.B.E. manufacturers, however, proved a big sticking point that helped speed the bill's collapse, giving environmental advocates a rare victory against the Bush administration, which had made the energy legislation a main objective this year. ''In the end, M.T.B.E. was the issue that could be singled out as an example of addressing the needs of a very specific group,'' said Subash Chandra, an energy analyst in the Houston office of Morgan Keegan & Company, an investment firm. Lyondell, the largest maker of the additive, is the largest single contributor to Mr. DeLay's 2004 campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan nonprofit research group based in Washington. Lyondell has also hired a prominent Houston law and lobbying firm, Bracewell & Patterson, which maintains a large operation in Washington, to represent its views to Congress on the M.T.B.E. issue. Essentially, Lyondell and other companies say they should be exempt from the product-defect portions of the lawsuits because, they assert, the additive is not defective and, they say, industry groups have warned local governments of the potential for groundwater contamination. In addition, M.T.B.E. makers point out that Congress itself requested in 1990 that M.T.B.E. and other additives be used in gasoline to reduce air pollution. Opponents to Mr. DeLay's measure, however, counter that companies in Texas have been producing M.T.B.E. since the 1970's when it became an octane-enhancing replacement for lead. Since then, M.T.B.E. manufacture has evolved into a large, if declining, industry. At Lyondell, for instance, sales of M.T.B.E. provide about a quarter of the company's $3.2 billion annual revenue. Texas Petrochemicals relies on M.T.B.E. sales for about half of its revenue and, in fact, weaker demand for the additive in recent years was a contributing factors to its bankruptcy filing earlier this year. ''We've been phasing it out,'' said Sara I. Cronin, a spokeswoman for Texas Petrochemicals. ''There has been a rapid decline in market demand for it.'' So far, the Environmental Protection Agency has said that it does not have adequate information about the potential health risks from consuming M.T.B.E. in water. The additive, which is considered a carcinogen, is known to easily contaminate public water systems because it dissolves in water easily and does not cling to soil very well. The corporate suites of M.T.B.E. manufacturers in Texas appear to be unfazed by the legislation's defeat. Frank Maisano, a lobbyist with Bracewell & Patterson who represents Lyondell, Valero and an industry group, the Oxygenated Fuels Association, said his clients remained optimistic that the provision protecting the companies would be revived next year as part of a new energy bill. ''This will remain part of the package and, if need be, a sticking point,'' Mr. Maisano said."
"Before the water went bad, most people in the trailer park never thought of their aluminum-skinned houses as a mobile home, only home. Hard against the rows of sugar cane, not far from the big chemical plants that light up the evening sky, the trailers in the Myrtle Grove park were dented but decent, and the tires rotted in the grass. Now, staying in the tree-shaded neighborhood just outside the river city of Plaquemine is unthinkable. There is poison in the well water that they used to drink, a chemical used to make plastic called vinyl chloride. The state knew this years ago, but residents were not told. They wonder what it will do to them someday, and what it has done to them already. In the late afternoon, the smell of real food -- smothered steak and stewed turkey necks -- drifts across the community of about 50 homes, and women lean against their cars to talk about the bad water with a kind of gauzy anger and an unspecific fear. ''Me, and Tammy, and Michelle, we all had miscarriages,'' Faye Robertson said, pointing down the road of trailers at the homes of her neighbors and friends. Women who live here say that as many as 13 pregnancies ended in miscarriage in just the last few years, and say that their children burned and itched from bath water and wading pools. ''June 30, 2001. Shermicia,'' Ms. Robertson said of the date she miscarried the baby, and the name she had picked out. She was pregnant when she found out, from tests on the wells, that the water was tainted, and read -- with a chill -- a pamphlet from health workers warning of possible threats from vinyl chloride to unborn children. ''And I thought, 'I hope I don't lose my baby,' '' she said. Health experts warned them that exposure to the colorless chemical, which is used to make plastic pipes, furniture and upholstery, could cause liver cancer, nerve damage, circulatory problems and skin lesions, but because incidents of drinking or bathing in such contaminated water are so rare, scientists are unsure about just how toxic it is. Animal testing showed that long-term exposure could cause reproductive problems, including miscarriage. Now, the double row of mobile homes is marked here and there by a bare brown patch of dirt, as the tow trucks come in and pull away the trailers, one by one. In less than two months, the deadline set by the landlord, they will all be gone. A community will cease to exist. ''But it's too late,'' said Lea James, who lives here. ''What effect will it have?'' she wondered, since she carries the residue of the chemical with her to a new home. The poisoning of the aquifer near Plaquemine (pronounced PLACK-uh-mun), has resulted in a criminal investigation by state and federal authorities. The state has impaneled a grand jury in Iberville Parish, which includes Myrtle Grove, and appointed a special prosecutor. ''This is the first time ever there has been a grand jury put together on environmental issues in the state of Louisiana,'' said Marylee M. Orr, executive director of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, a watchdog organization. ''The local people are really afraid.'' They are also angry. For years, state inspectors knew of the contamination, and never said a word. For at least five years, 1997 to 2001, wells at the Myrtle Grove Trailer Park off Bayou Jacob Road poured polluted water into the saucepans, wading pools and water glasses of some 300 residents here. The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals first detected the contamination in 1997 but, through what state officials called ''human error,'' failed to tell people here about it. The state health agency, because of its self-described bureaucratic foul-up, also failed to tell the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Residents here say the vinyl chloride probably existed for years before it was detected in the Upper Plaquemine Aquifer in 1997. People here call it ''Dow water'' and believe that the Dow chemical plant nearby is responsible for the contamination. Dow officials say that their plant is not the source of the pollution at Myrtle Grove and that their scientists are working in the community to pinpoint the source. The trailer park's residents are suing the Department of Health and Hospitals, the park's owner, A. Wilberts Sons, and Dow, which manufactures vinyl chloride in the plant about two miles away. They worry about the potential damage to their bodies but seem just as angry about being run off from their homes. It is, despite the temporary nature of their dwellings, a real home, said Tammy Green, who works as a home-care provider in the parish. She is 37 and has lived here 19 years, raising two children with her husband, Lloyd. Newly painted iron barbecue grills sit outside. A big shade tree cools the yard in the summer, and in this part of the world, summer is almost all the time. Once, before the water scared them, there would have been a baby in a wading pool in almost every yard, and people washing their cars in the driveways. ''And we just all went on with life, cooking with it, not knowing,'' Mrs. Green said. On Father's Day, three years ago, she had a miscarriage, but no one had told them yet about the threat. When she and the other women here learned about the vinyl chloride, she said, they began to count the number of miscarriages in recent years. ''Thirteen,'' she said. ''That many women on one street? Something is wrong.'' ''I know I'll never try again,'' she said of her pregnancy. ''I'll never do that again.'' Residents here laugh at the notion, put forth by some experts, that the vinyl chloride does not emanate from a chemical plant. ''It appears to be originating from the area where Dow has its production facilities,'' said Wilma Subra, a chemist and consultant to the Louisiana Environmental Action Network. ''They produce vinyl chloride. They sell it.'' After a two-year investigation, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality is reluctant to conclude that the contamination emanates from Dow, said Tim Knight, the state environmental technology administrator. But when asked if the company was the prime suspect, he said yes. Tests in the aquifer underneath the plant itself showed no vinyl chloride, said Rebecca Bentley, a spokeswoman for Dow in Louisiana. Also, Dow's tests show that water in the aquifer flows primarily to the west, not toward the trailer park, which is southwest of the plant. The Environmental Protection Agency's tests, however, showed that the aquifer, 190 feet below the surface, flows in a south to southwest direction from the plant, which would carry it under the trailer park. One agency expert, James T. Wilson, said he did not believe the vinyl chloride was coming from the Dow plant and said an accidental release into the air would evaporate. Instead, he believes that pollution here is from an old spill of another chemical that broke down into vinyl chloride. But Ms. Subra said a seepage into the soil or the aquifer would not evaporate and would collect in the groundwater. ''We believe it's pure product,'' said Ms. Orr of the vinyl chloride in the water, and not the result of a chemical breakdown. Dow has helped in the investigation to find the source by paying for test wells, Ms. Bentley said. ''We would agree that it's unfortunate that these people's lives have been disrupted,'' she said. ''We are working to be part of the solution.'' Residents of Myrtle Grove say the state is afraid to pursue Dow, which employs 3,000 people in its plant here. The cars in most of the driveways here are paid for, directly or indirectly, by Dow paychecks. Home notes depend on the plant. In Myrtle Grove, only the empty spaces hint that there is anything wrong. Children still wheel their bicycles up Kuneman Road, as their mothers wonder how they can afford to relocate on paychecks that are already spoken for by utility companies and creditors. Most residents work blue-collar jobs, installing insulation, working in the sugar-cane business or as nurse's aides and home-care workers. Many people here have refused to pay rent, blaming the landowner, partly, for their predicament. The landlord, who is closing the park because of skyrocketing insurance rates caused by the pollution, has given them $2,000 to relocate. ''They are just victims like the other folks,'' said Rafael Bermudez, a spokesman for A. Wilberts Sons. ''They've lost their trailer park. It was their land that was contaminated.'' ''They would like to find out themselves,'' he said of the source. People, despite the ominous nature of their eviction, say they will stay as long as they can, drinking from water lines that now bring safe city water into their not really mobile homes. Everyone seems to drift outside as the afternoon cools, as the wind blows in off the cane fields. Grandmothers tend small children, and about 3 p.m. a big yellow bus sends a throng of them running for the trailers that are pocked and warped but, here and there, freshly painted. Porches have been built on some. ''It was a nice place,'' said Joyce Barrett, who has already left."
"Federal geologists have identified a band of counties stretching from northern Massachusetts to coastal Maine where water in private wells is likely to contain potentially harmful levels of arsenic. The heightened risk comes from a conjunction of bedrock that contains traces of arsenic, alkaline ground water that is most likely to release it and growing numbers of suburban households using private wells sunk directly into the rock, the scientists report in a study being published in the June edition of Environmental Science and Technology, a journal published by the American Chemical Society. No studies have linked water consumption in the area with elevated cancer rates. Even so, public health officials in the affected states have recently begun urging well users to test their water. The highest levels measured in the study were many times lower than concentrations linked to bladder cancers and other ailments in past studies overseas. Still, the researchers estimated that more than 100,000 people in the affected areas were likely to be drinking water exceeding the newly adopted federal standard for arsenic, which in 2006 drops to 10 parts per billion, from the longstanding limit of 50 parts per billion. The Bush administration accepted the lower limit for public water supplies in 2001, after expert panels concluded that it was justified and that filtration costs were affordable. The researchers said the potential exposure was likely to increase because of the fast rate of growth of suburban neighborhoods in the region, almost all of which rely on water from private wells. ''These communities are all getting bigger by the day,'' said Joseph D. Ayotte, the study's lead author and a hydrologist in the New Hampshire office of the United States Geological Survey. The analysis was done by the Geological Survey. Private wells are not governed by federal water rules and are subject to few state regulations, leaving it to property owners to test for potential problems. Such wells -- of necessity situated directly beneath a particular bit of property -- have a greater likelihood of drawing water with elevated arsenic levels because they are often drilled directly into bedrock, the authors said. In contrast, public wells tend to draw on ground water circulating in beds of loose sediment, where arsenic is rarely a problem. The two counties with the most people with possible exposure were Rockingham, in coastal New Hampshire, and York, the southernmost county in Maine. Both have just the wrong combination of a particular metamorphic rock, high-pH ground water and lots of people drinking water from private wells, the researchers said. Eastern New England, like western Minnesota, parts of Michigan and some parts of the Southwest, had already been identified as tending to have naturally elevated arsenic levels in groundwater. The new study more precisely defines the area of risk in New England, experts said, and should help property owners determine whether arsenic testing is necessary. State health and environmental officials in the region said they had not yet seen the new study, but said they were already working with the federal Environmental Protection Agency to encourage more testing for arsenic and other hazards."
"The state acknowledged today that it failed to manage adequately the cleanup of a solid waste landfill here, a lapse environmentalists say may have allowed tons of heavy metals, benzenes and other carcinogens to seep into the groundwater and possibly the Raritan River. The comments by state regulators came in response to complaints from the local environmental group, the Edison Wetlands Association, and Isaac Heller, the owner of an industrial park next to the 145-acre ILR Landfill. A spokeswoman for the State Department of Environmental Protection conceded that the delay in addressing the leaching of dangerous chemicals from the inactive landfill meant that the state had ''not adequately and appropriately managed'' the cleanup. ''But in the last year, the pace of action has picked up significantly,'' said the spokeswoman, Mary Helen Cervantes, who stopped short of blaming previous administrations for the long delay. ''There was interaction back and forth over the years between the state and ILR, but the bottom line is that we now have a plan that we expect to finalize in a few weeks.'' She also acknowledged that contaminated liquid from the site was affecting groundwater and said that the estimated $1.7 million cost of the cleanup would be covered by an escrow fund. The landfill was closed in 1989, after Mr. Heller and others filed suit charging that it violated state environmental laws. Under a consent decree, ILR was forced to cap the site and pump leachate from it. Mr. Heller and the wetlands association have recently suggested that the site's owner is not complying with the order, citing a suspicious fluid that was flowing from the site. Gary Lotano, a developer from Toms River whose family has owned the former landfill site since the early 1980's, denied those charges. He said that talks with the state over what type of system would be required for the cleanup had dragged on with no resolution. Through it all, he said, there was little urgency, and he was never cited for violating the court-ordered closing and landfill capping plan. ''My sense is that we were not a big environmental problem to them,'' Mr. Lotano said. He expressed anger about the accusations. He said that Mr. Heller sought four years ago to buy the land to expand his Heller Industrial Park and distribution center and was upset about the failure of the two businessmen to come to terms on a price. But Mr. Heller said that the failure of those negotiations had not led to current complaints about the site. The concern, he said, dated back a few months, when the officials from wetlands association reported that they had seen ''a discolored, oily liquid spewing out of'' the landfill, forming rivulets. Robert Spiegel, executive director of the Edison Wetlands Association, said as he stood near the site today that the area had come to be called the ''Valley of the Dumps.'' Three plateau-like mounds marked the ILR landfill, the closed Edison municipal landfill and the notorious Kin-Buc hazardous waste dump, which was No. 1 on the federal government's list of Superfund sites in the 70's and 80's. ''These are all open sores on the Raritan River,'' Mr. Spiegel said. ''The ILR site is a screaming example of the problems which could prevent use of the river.'' Despite Mr. Spiegel's concerns, Ms. Cervantes said that there was no evidence that the leachate had contaminated the brackish reach of the Raritan River, at that point some two miles from where it empties into Raritan Bay."
"An afternoon sun shone on the sands of Hudson Park and Harbor Island beaches in Westchester County yesterday, and the sparkling water beckoned raucous children and veteran sunbathers. But red-lettered signs at both public beaches proclaimed, ''Water Closed by Order of Health Dept.'' and ''No Swimming.'' Or simply, ''Beach Closed.'' Only a gaggle of geese and several ducklings paddled in the water lapping at the beach. The humans stayed on the sand and watched. On Friday, the Westchester County Department of Health recommended the closing of both beaches to swimmers for at least the weekend because of fears of raw sewage in the waters at Harbor Island, in Mamaroneck, and a rise in dangerous bacteria at Hudson Park, in New Rochelle. ''This is crazy,'' Margaret Chadwick, 41, of New Rochelle said as she lounged on a lawn chair on Hudson Park Beach and gestured toward the Echo Bay inlet. ''This has to stop. This is a magnificent body of water, and we get to stare at it.'' Residents and lifeguards said Hudson Park Beach was closed several times last summer because of sewage problems. Water troubles have plagued both beaches in recent years, but Harbor Island has endured constant challenges. Three years ago, the waters were declared off limits because of high levels of coliform bacteria. The most common of those bacteria is E. coli, which can cause severe intestinal problems when swallowed, said Joshua Lipsman, the Westchester County commissioner of health. As a remedy, the village of Mamaroneck acquired a Gunderboom, a giant curtainlike structure inserted around the beach's swimming area as a bacteria filter. But a 1,200-gallon fuel leak from a boat destroyed the first Gunderboom shortly after its installation, said Phil Trifiletti, the mayor of Mamaroneck. The replacement Gunderboom, a dark green mass that measures 800 feet to 900 feet and cost $135,000, was installed in the fall and functioned well, Mr. Trifiletti said. And so, two weeks ago, the waters of Harbor Island opened to swimmers for the first time in three years. But on Friday, when officials found out that a roughly 80-year-old sewage pipe had begun leaking into the rainwater that runs into the Mamaroneck Harbor, the village closed off the waters again. ''It's a little frustrating,'' Mr. Trifiletti said, adding that the village planned to identify and replace any weak sewer pipes. ''It's not easy to get it perfect the first time, but we will get there.'' Many would-be waders were reduced to using showers, water jets and cups of water for cool comfort yesterday. Most of them reluctantly complied with the orders to avoid the water, though Melissa Monik, 21, the head lifeguard at Hudson Park, said some beachgoers had argued with her. ''The water looks so clean,'' said Ms. Monik, of New Rochelle. ''It's so hard to explain.'' Dr. Lipsman attributed the closings of the waters at the two public beaches, and four private beaches in Mamaroneck, to location and urban activity. The beaches, nestled in the belly of inlets, receive little water from Long Island Sound, he said. In addition, the extraordinary amount of rain last month washed a lot of organic waste from the streets into the swimming areas, Dr. Lipsman said. But beachgoers baking under the sun showed an eagerness to take to the water -- especially the younger ones. Clothed in a sporty pink two-piece swimsuit, Daniella Granata, 5, traveled with her father, Vincent, 36, and brother Nicholas, 3, from their Yonkers home, hoping to jump into the inlet at the Harbor Island beach. ''I felt sad because I wanted to go into the water,'' Daniella said. Instead, she and Nicholas spent some time in the sprayground, a play area filled with giant water guns and fountains. Mr. Trifiletti said he hoped that the village would fix the sewage pipe leak within 10 days and that Harbor Island Beach would reopen in two weeks. Because the Department of Health cannot pinpoint the source of the bacteria in Hudson Park, that beach will remained closed indefinitely, Dr. Lipsman said."
"African Beetle's Takeout It may be dung to an elephant, but it's a certain African beetle's bread and butter. So when the dung beetle Scarabaeus zambesianus gathers up its evening repast, it wants to high-tail it out of the dung pile in case there are thieving insects around. The beetle rolls its ball of dung along as straight a path as possible. Scientists from Sweden and South Africa have figured out how the beetle manages to do this: it uses the polarized light of the setting sun to orient itself. But many insects and animals use a sun compass. What makes this species different, the researchers write in the journal Nature, is that it also uses the much dimmer polarized light of the moon. It's the first creature known to use moonlight this way. The researchers found that the dung beetles were able to roll their dung balls in straight lines in twilight and were able to keep a straight course even after the sun was well below the horizon, as long as the moon was up. On moonless nights, the beetles started wandering all over. To test whether they were actually using the polarized moonlight (and not, say, the location of the moon as a visual guide), the researchers blocked the view of the moon and placed a polarizing filter over the beetle, making it appear to the insect that the polarization was changing. This resulted in the beetle's changing course as the polarization changed. The researchers suggest that the ability to use polarized moonlight allows the species more time to forage and that the ability may be widespread in animals. Of Smog and Sulfur A modern automobile engine equipped with the latest emission-control equipment does a pretty good job of eliminating pollutants like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. But one thing it can't do much about is sulfur, an element that occurs naturally in the gasoline. With an engine, it's sulfur in, sulfur out, in the form of sulfur dioxide and sulfate particles, which contribute to smog. The federal government has mandated that the sulfur content of gasoline (and diesel and jet fuel) be reduced sharply. Sulfur in gasoline, for example, will have to be reduced from the current average of 350 parts per million by weight to just 30 p.p.m.w. by January 2005. Since current technologies for reducing sulfur are complicated and costly, some refiners are unsure just how they will meet the new requirements. Scientists at the University of Michigan may have an answer. They have come up with a mineral that functions as a molecular sieve to remove the sulfur from hydrocarbon fuels at normal temperatures and pressures. The mineral is a zeolite, an alumino-silicate crystalline compound that is something like clay. The researchers, who described their work in the current issue of Science, first did some theoretical calculations to determine that zeolites with copper or silver ions would potentially be the most effective in adsorbing thiophene, a hard-to-remove sulfur compound in gasoline. Then they created these zeolites in the lab. Sure enough, they found them to be highly effective in removing sulfur. In diesel fuel, for example, the sulfur level dropped from 430 parts per million by weight to less than 0.2 p.p.m.w. Bacteria, Working 24/7 Cleanup of a different sort is the subject of work at Georgia Tech. There, researchers have isolated a bacterium that can consume dichloroethene and vinyl chloride, organic compounds that form from commonly used industrial solvents. Dichloroethene and vinyl chloride are nasty substances and contaminate groundwater at industrial waste sites. The bacterium, called BAV1, breaks down the contaminants into benign compounds like ethene and inorganic chloride. It thrives without oxygen, a useful attribute given that many water sources are below the surface and thus oxygen-poor. So the researchers suggest that the bacteria may prove useful in cleaning up underground aquifers as well as protecting surface reservoirs. Observatory"
"Alfredo Castellano stabbed his hook through a hunk of raw fish and cast bait and sinker toward Queens. Then he sat next to his wife, Carmen, their backs to the thigh-high retaining wall separating them from dense traffic on Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive. The sun had just dipped behind the housing projects of East Harlem, offering slight relief from the evening swelter. Their 7-year-old son, Giovanni, jumped and giggled, dodging his friend Jasmine, 11, as she swung in a hammock strung between a plane tree and a lamppost. Sure, the Castellanos said, they catch fish from the East River. Maybe two or three times a week, they catch them and eat them. Giovanni does not like fish, but Ms. Castellano allows that she probably ate it when she was pregnant with him. ''I eat them all the time, and I never got sick,'' she said. ''If it was dangerous, there would be signs out here, right?'' There are no signs in sight. ''It doesn't worry me,'' she said. Maybe it should. The State Health Department regularly publishes advisories warning that because of PCB contamination, most adults should eat fish caught from the East River no more than once a month and should avoid eels entirely. The state says children under 15 should not eat any of the fish, nor should women of child-bearing age, whose bodies can store the toxins and pass them on to their children during pregnancy or while nursing. Similar advisories apply to the waters of the Hudson and Harlem Rivers, New York Harbor, and to many rivers and lakes around the state. A recent report showed that of more than 200 people interviewed at East Harlem centers for the federal Women, Infants and Children nutrition program, one in 10 ate locally caught fish. The report, by researchers at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, was published this month in the Journal of Urban Health. ''A lot of the people we talked to who were receiving fish from the local water were aware, in some form, of the health advisories,'' said Laura Bienenfeld, a clinical instructor who was one of the authors of the study. ''But that didn't mean they were aware of how it could affect their children, or that they understood how persistent these toxins can be in our bodies and our environment.'' The study showed that most people who ate local fish broiled or grilled it, reducing the PCB concentration by melting off the fat that stores the chemicals most readily. Fewer fried it, which would retain the fat and a higher level of PCB's. On a warm day, especially in the evening, the thin strip of paving stones and grass along the river in East Harlem bristles with fishing rods, and so does the southern edge of Wards Island, a short hike across a pedestrian bridge. Fishermen -- and they are, nearly all of them, men -- crowd every bench and patch of shade, telling stories, drawing on cigarettes, waiting for a tug. People can be found fishing almost anywhere on the city's many shorelines, but the waterfront alongside East Harlem is one of the busiest, thanks to a combination of economics, geography, culture and misinformation. Poverty plays a role, of course; pulling a meal from the river is cheaper than buying it at a market, and some anglers earn a few dollars by taking their catch back to the barrio and selling it. And few poor neighborhoods in the city offer as ready access to the water as East Harlem. Many people talk of fishing as a pastime picked up during childhood in Puerto Rico or in the Dominican Republic. In fact, some say they fish just to fish, and throw back what they catch. ''I'm from Santurce, in Puerto Rico; my father was a fisherman, and I've fished all my life,'' Ramon Rivera, sitting at the tip of Wards Island, said with a laugh and a shrug. ''I don't eat them. I just like to fish. It's what we do.'' But many of the people who eat fish from the East River have only a vague comprehension of the peril, or none at all. Polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, were used as insulation in electrical equipment until the 1970's and were dumped into some of the nation's waterways, notably the upper Hudson. They settled into the underwater silt and were slowly buried over time. The concentrations in the water dropped over the years, but the advisories remain. PCB's are thought to pose a risk of cancer and, with prenatal or early childhood exposure, of developmental disabilities. ''These fish aren't from here, they come from upstate or somewhere, and then they swim over here, so they're safe,'' one fisherman, Ponce Rome, said, incorrectly. ''We've been eating them for years, me and my wife,'' he said, showing off his catch for the day, a gorgeous, two-foot striped bass and a 16-inch bluefish with a mouth full of tiny, needle-sharp teeth. ''We eat this fish maybe once a week -- more this time of year.'' With all the publicity given to PCB's in the Hudson, there is a widespread but mistaken belief that fish from only that river are dangerous. Jose Santana, sitting under a tree with his 17-month-old daughter, Julia, said he fished on the East River twice a week. He said his wife, Diana, had not eaten local fish when she was pregnant, but had beforehand and while nursing. ''Bluefish I don't worry about -- those are good,'' he said. ''I heard the striped bass could be dangerous, so I usually don't eat those.'' Other fishermen insisted it was the other way around. In fact, the advisory applies to all species. A police car rolled slowly up the walk, and the officer behind the wheel said he had heard of the health advisories, though he did not recall the specifics. ''I come by here every day and I tell these people, 'I wouldn't be eating what I catch here,' '' he said. ''But they keep coming back.''"
"A WEEK ago Wednesday dawned hot and clammy. Kari Kaalstad of Fairfield, and Suzy Weber, visiting from Richmond, Va., with two daughters each in tow, drove to Jennings Beach in Fairfield for a swim. ''No Bathing,'' the sign said. Fairfield's beach authorities pride themselves on full disclosure: sewage from Bridgeport had overflowed into the waters earlier in the week, Melissa Beattie, the college student working in the guardhouse, was telling anyone who asked. Beaches and swimming holes have, for the most part, closed more often this year than in the past two years. Byram Beach in Greenwich had been closed 25 times by Aug. 5. Last year, it was closed 12 days over the entire summer. Stamford had closed its beaches 11 times by Aug. 5. Last summer, it closed them just twice. The reasons are many, according to to health directors and environmentalists, who have adopted a language of delicate words to avoid the indelicate ones. ''Effluent, runoff, boating discharges, floatables,'' they say, synonyms for the ills that plague waters throughout the country, particularly when clouds spew rain with the kind of vengeance they have shown several times this summer. ''Beach closures are up all over, and a lot of them are due to wet weather,'' said Mel Cote of the Environmental Protection Agency's New England office. Last summer 2.61 inches of rain fell in July in Connecticut, according to the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C. This year, by comparison, 3.35 inches fell. The first week of August, rain fell steadily. ''Sewer overflows and storm water runoff, typically from urbanized areas, domestic animal waste, dog poop, waste from seagulls and geese, areas with septic systems that are failing and therefore not removing bacteria, and in some cases illegal and sometimes unknown connections between sanitary systems and public waters are partly to blame,'' Mr. Cote said. ''More monitoring, and a more cautionary attitude because there is so much more attention being paid to this issue, is also part of the explanation.'' Do citizens understand what is flowing into their waters? Several employees including Mr. Cote who had gathered recently in the E.P.A.'s office in Boston said, in unison, ''Probably not.'' If they did, they might not go in. At Jennings Beach that day, Phyllis and George Meropoulos of Monroe were getting their two children ready for a swim when they heard that the beach had been closed only an hour earlier due to the sewage overflow from the Bridgeport Water Pollution Control Authority Plants, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection. Mrs. Meropoulos frowned. ''That's gross,'' she said. ''I'm not sure I'll let my 1-year-old in. I'm pretty protective of my children in the water.'' The couple stood, looking at the water, indecision shadowing their faces. Contaminated water has been known to cause gastroenteritis, resulting in vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever, ear, nose and throat infections, and in more serious cases, typhoid fever, dysentery, hepatitis and cholera, according to the E.P.A. Fortunately for state residents, the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national nonprofit environmental group, gives Connecticut high marks for monitoring its waters. That doesn't mean the waters are necessarily cleaner than anywhere else -- Connecticut produced 950,000 tons of animal waste in 1997, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, although that is small change compared to Texas, which topped the list with 110 million tons -- but the authorities say more effective monitoring at least allows them to close beaches before health problems arise. ''Connecticut is certainly among the better states in terms of monitoring,'' said Mark Dorfman, author of an annual N.R.D.C. report that assesses beach contamination. ''At the same time, it's showing that we really do have a problem nationwide. Having good monitoring is a good thing, but it's not enough.'' In some cases, years of monitoring have given towns enough information to make pre-emptive strikes. Once a certain amount of rain falls, health directors in towns such as Greenwich and Stamford close the beaches to swimming. Stamford, which has its own laboratory to test bacteria samples, has been closing its beaches preemptively since the late 1980's. ''I don't have a problem with storm water - it brings nutrients into the Sound - but I do have a problem with sewage,'' said Joe Kuntz, the Stamford health director and the Sherlock Holmes of sewage overflow detection. ''Some water treatment plants discharge sewage into the Sound, mostly because of heavy rains.'' In one case, bacteria levels were consistently high at one of Stamford's beaches, and Mr. Kuntz and his staff were struggling to determine the cause. ''You have other people walking the beat with you, you test, you go backwards to find out which place is what, you test, you walk the beat,'' he said. They eventually discovered the cause: a 250-unit condominium was not hooked to a sanitary sewer. Sewage was directly entering the storm drain, and on days of high rainfall, running off into the Sound. At Greenwich Point in Greenwich, more than an inch and a half of rainfall on any given day in July will force the ''No Bathing'' sign to be posted. From August to September, an inch is the standard for prohibiting swimming there. Byram Beach in Greenwich closes if only a half-inch of rain falls any given day in July, because it doesn't get much of what health authorities call ''flushing action,'' which disperses bacteria farther out in the Sound. ''You're right on the boundaries of Port Chester and Greenwich, and they are highly populated areas,'' said Robert T. Farfaglia, Greenwich's acting director of environmental health. ''There's going to be some effect from heavily populated areas. The fact that we're here and we do pollute as human beings, we're going to have to deal with it.'' At Jennings Beach in Fairfield, Mrs. Kaalstad and Mrs. Weber sat on the beach - the ''No Bathing'' sign had come down by then -- and reminisced back to a time when both lived in Greenwich, and both tried to use Byram Beach. ''It felt like it was always closed,'' Mrs. Kaalstad said. ''They have a pool over there, too, and that was always packed when the beach closed.'' Most cities in New England are dependent upon old infrastructure in which sanitary sewer systems combined with storm drains. High rainfalls cause overflow into the nearest water body. In Providence, R.I., workers are now digging underground caverns --in essence they are huge holding tanks -- to store sewage and storm water in an effort to keep pollution levels low in the waterways. ''We're trying to get cities to replace these outdated systems, but it's very expensive work,'' Mr. Cote said. ''So in Connecticut, you have an overflow into the storm drain and a discharge into the waterways.'' Short of forcing the states to rebuild antiquated sewer systems, the federal government enacted the Beach Act of 2000, which increased the money available to coastal and Great Lakes States to improve water quality monitoring. The E.P.A. disburses the money, in some cases to states that are starting monitoring programs. Connecticut, having already had systems in place, has been able to use the $226,000 E.P.A. grant to standardize its testing. A car and a driver paid for by the grant picks up bacteria samples from towns throughout the state and brings them to the public health lab in Hartford for testing. Most towns take bacteria samples from their waters about once a week, some twice a month. Not all beachgoers appreciate state and town efforts regarding their health. Several days ago, after the sewage spill, a beachgoer challenged a Jennings Beach lifeguard who told her high bacteria levels had closed the beach to swimming. The woman retorted, ''What are you going to do, tackle me?'' The lifeguard reasoned with her. ''Why would you want to go into waters that are contaminated?'' he asked. She stayed on the sand. The next day, a man who wandered near the water was told he wouldn't be allowed in the water either. ''What'll happen to me if I go in?'' he challenged. Fairfield's waterfront director, George Taterosian, was called. ''We had processed sewage on the beach,'' Mr. Taterosian said. ''I said to the lifeguard, 'tell him if he has a problem, I can call the police and have him removed.''' That beachgoer stayed on the sand too. ''We take all the precautions we can take,'' Mr. Taterosian said. ''I have guards walking up and down looking for spillage. Even on good days, we have our lifeguard captains walk the beach everyday, looking.'' On Aug. 4, Judy Nelson, the Westport health director, received a call from Fairfield health authorities that the sewage overflow was prompting Fairfield to close its beaches. ''Everyone thinks the water moves along the shoreline, but it actually flushes out to the Sound,'' Ms. Nelson said. ''But sometimes I close a beach on the Fairfield end because Fairfield has a different policy from ours. When they close their beaches, they close all their beaches. But it's hard to explain to a Westport beachgoer why Fairfield is closed and we're not.'' Westport's lifeguard staff was advised Aug. 4 to watch for what Ms. Nelson called ''floatables,'' an innocuous term that defines any debris from a sewage treatment plant, from toilet paper to raw sewage. ''If we see anything,'' she said, ''we close on a dime.'' But the floatables didn't float to Westport, and the beaches stayed open. A day later, Ms. Nelson received a call from the Department of Environmental Protection. The state was closing five state-run beaches, including one of the state's largest, Sherwood Island State Park in Westport. Bacteria levels had climbed to unacceptable standards. Silver Sands State Park in Milford, Indian Well State Park in Shelton, Wharton Brook State Park in Wallingford, and Kettletown State Park in Southbury also were closed. The next day, Mashamoquet Brook State Park in Pomfret, also closed. That was a good day, not because of the closings, but because the state had taken the time to make the call. The relationship between Westport and the state had been rocky at times, particularly one summer after Ms. Nelson took on state authorities over Sherwood Island. Westport's bacteria counts had come back high, and Sherwood Island State Park sits in the middle of two of Westport's beaches. Ms. Nelson closed them. ''We didn't know if there had been a tanker discharge or what was happening,'' she said. Then she challenged the state to do the same with Sherwood Island. All Ms. Nelson would say of the event was that it worked itself out. ''I've been here for 18 years, and we've come a long way,'' she said. ''I'm really pleased about that.'' By next year, information should really be flowing. As part of the Beach Act of 2000, the federal government is requiring coastal states to produce specific details on its beaches, from where they are, their lengths, their sampling locations and sampling frequency. Considering that the state now has one person who is charged with not only trying to collect basic data, but also is responsible for bathing area reviews and review and approval of public pools in the state, the depth and breadth of beach information may seem like a flood. ''In the past we've had limited resources to provide much assistance in this area,'' Ms. Blaschinski said. ''We will be happy, in particular, to get the kind of data collection on what towns are doing, and how many closures they have.'' Melanie Rogan of Fairfield is a dedicated Jennings beachgoer, visiting about three times a week with her 18-month-old son. She saw the ''No Bathing'' sign that recent Wednesday, proceeded onto the beach and let her child play in the sand until the sign was taken down. The thought of a dip, sans floatables, was no longer a daunting event. ''It happens,'' she said. ''You just have to be careful.'' Connecticut"
"A decision this week to delay and modify tough new regulations on storm water runoff from new developments in New Jersey has drawn mixed reviews from environmentalists, who once cheered Gov. James E. McGreevey's antisprawl speeches. Some are now questioning his commitment to controlling sprawl, while others are applauding his determination to do what they say is the right thing. At issue is the discovery by state environmental regulators that new rules to protect 2,000 miles of state streams and rivers from polluted runoff contained a loophole that would have exempted subdivision proposals if they had already been approved at the local level. The rules, years in the making, had been scheduled to take effect this month. Bradley Campbell, the commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, said that rather than adopt defective rules, the administration scuttled the proposed regulations and then redrafted them to close the loophole somewhat. This meant, he said, that the more stringent rules could not go into effect until the end of the year, after a two-month comment period. But some environmentalists, such as Jeff Tittel, executive director of the Sierra Club of New Jersey, said that the administration had not only failed to close the loophole completely, it had given developers two to three months to get their projects the necessary approvals to avoid being subject to the new rules. Ticking off a long list of proposals around the state that he said local environmental groups had been fighting in legal battles, Mr. Tittel said he now feared the loss of these areas to the very sprawl that the administration had criticized. ''Citizens have raised money from bake sales to fight these proposals, and we thought that finally the state was stepping in to help us,'' said Mr. Tittel, who had been among the environmentalists who praised the McGreevey administration's goal of stemming sprawl. ''But I am now troubled about the governor's commitment to controlling sprawl because they seem to be backing away with this change and delay. The builders have won and the environment has lost.'' Others do not see this week's developments in such ominous terms. David Pringle, the Trenton lobbyist for the New Jersey Environmental Federation, said he was willing to wait before judging Commissioner Campbell and the administration. He said the original loophole had been a serious problem, in that it would have let 90 percent of the most controversial pending projects go to approval. What is unknown, he said, is whether the changes put forward cut that percentage to ''say, 10 percent.'' ''They have assured us that just a few, a handful, will slip through and be grandfathered in,'' he said. ''But we haven't seen hard data on that.'' To Tom Borden, director of the Rutgers Environmental Law Clinic, which is representing some opponents of a subdivision proposal in Hunterdon County, the question of a handful of projects all depends on ''how big your hand is.'' Both he and State Senator Leonard Lance, Republican of Hunterdon, wondered aloud why state officials did not leave the rules in place and then propose changes to fix the defects or simply use the state's emergency powers to immediately impose rules. The new rules are the first comprehensive regulations New Jersey has established to strictly control the quantity and quality of storm runoff into the state's waters and into aquifers that feed wells. Among other things, the rules would require the removal of 80 percent of suspended solids in runoff dumped into waterways and establish a 300-foot buffer between all new development and streams officially designated as having a ''high quality of water.'' Mr. Campbell said that before this, such streams had had no such protection from development. The original draft of the rules exempted any major development that already had any preliminary local approval from having to meet the requirements. The amended version exempts only those plans that have local approval and at least one of the many necessary Department of Environmental Protection permits needed to build. John Scillia, president of Garden State Engineering, a private engineering company, and an expert on storm water runoff, called the rules ''an extremely significant change.'' Mr. Scillia said that the state's environmental regulators, and not localities, would have greater control over what is built and how. Regardless of the delay in the rules' effect, he said that state control existed now ''as a practical matter'' and could halt any rush to approval by developers with pending proposals. He said that putting the rules in place on an emergency basis would have been pointless because the permit process and structure to issue them and enforce their restrictions were not yet in place in the environmental agency. ''I think they want to get this right,'' Mr. Scillia said."
"After months of threatening imminent action, New Jersey officials say they will soon begin broadly enforcing a law that requires polluters to pay the total costs of restoring water sources and other natural resources damaged by contaminants, not just clean up the mess left behind. The state's decision to pursue aggressively what are known as natural resource damages could create hundreds of millions of dollars in additional costs for New Jersey businesses, especially any heavily polluting chemical and petrochemical companies. Such damages have been collected in the past, but generally only in cases related to catastrophic ecological events, like major oil spills. New Jersey's program, which is being closely watched by other states, would be the first systematic attempt to seek restoration and compensation for damage to natural resources in cases involving more routine pollution. ''Like in other states, our natural resources have been diminished far more by the accretion of smaller environmental insults from various sources of contamination,'' said Bradley M. Campbell, the state's commissioner of environmental protection, ''and it would shortchange the public interest if we write off these claims instead of pursuing them.'' In particular, Mr. Campbell said, the state must be a better steward of its water resources, since the strains of pollution and overuse are making them the most significant roadblock to the state's growth. New Jersey expects its population to increase by one million by 2020. Demand for water is expected to outstrip supply in a number of areas of the state within a few years. Camden, the economically depressed city on the Delaware River in South Jersey, is expected to exhaust its water supply within a decade, environmentalists and state officials say. Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, pointed out that Camden could not afford the expense of finding an alternative water source. That kind of talk makes industry nervous. Many companies already regard themselves as scapegoats for the pollution created during the days when environmental controls were virtually nonexistent, and they fear that they are now being asked to shoulder a range of environmental burdens that are the price of the state's prosperity, including looming infrastructure expenses. Critics of the state's plan say aggressive enforcement could scare businesses off in a struggling economy and undermine cooperation on current cleanup programs. The state will initially focus on areas where there has been significant contamination to groundwater; there are more than 3,000 known sites of such contamination, according to the Department of Environmental Protection. States are the sole trustees of groundwater, whereas oversight for other natural resources -- surface water, plants, birds and fish -- is shared with federal authorities. For the last few months, state environmental officials have been negotiating with companies responsible for contaminated sites, and the state had set several deadlines -- the last one was Labor Day -- for the enforcement crackdown. But Mr. Campbell said last Wednesday that the negotiations and the preparation of legal claims against uncooperative companies were taking longer than expected. ''There will be a series of announcements later this month on claims against responsible parties that have liabilities at one or multiple sites,'' he said. The state first developed regulations for enforcing natural resource damage claims under the Whitman administration. They have been rarely enforced since the state won an appeals court ruling in April 2000 thwarting a legal challenge by industry giants including Chevron, Exxon, Mobil, Public Service Electric and Gas, and DuPont. Shortly after the ruling, the industry won passage of a law forcing the state to assert claims of damage to natural resources by 2005, a factor that is encouraging the state to take action, said Tom Borden, director of the Rutgers Environmental Law Clinic. Businesses have long tried to undermine this pending liability. ''Gee whiz, let me think,'' said John Maxwell of the New Jersey chapter of the American Petroleum Council, which opposes the program. ''It's my property, I had a spill, I cleaned it up. Now I have to pay natural resources claims. That doesn't seem appropriate.'' In cases where the costs of restoring a natural resource are prohibitively expensive, the state says it will consider a compromise. For example, the state may forgo a claim for damages if a polluter restores nearby wetlands or provides a substitute recreation area."
"Lawmakers and industry lobbyists said today that they expected the emerging energy measure to provide liability protection for producers of a gasoline additive blamed for groundwater contamination as the chief negotiators said they would like to conclude the energy talks by next week. Though Republicans writing the bill were differing over details of how to safeguard manufacturers of methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, from lawsuits, those close to the negotiations said the final proposal would likely grant the protection sought by key House Republicans with refineries in their districts. A memorandum circulated today by the Oxygenated Fuels Association, which represents MTBE producers, said it was clear that the liability provisions sought by the House would be included though it was less certain whether the bill would establish a timetable for an outright ban on the chemical as sought by the Senate. House members argue that the question of a ban should be left to the states. Granting the MTBE producers protection from suits over costs associated with cleanup of the chemical would provide critics of the measure with another focal point since some members of Congress and conservation groups consider the liability protection an unwarranted benefit to companies that should bear responsibility for their product. Local officials and water system operators also oppose the provision. ''It's outrageous,'' said Emily Figdor of the United States Public Interest Research Group. ''It is going to cost billions of dollars to clean up and the costs are going to shift to many cities.'' Industry officials and lawmakers backing the provision, including Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, said the liability protection would be narrow and would not interfere with suits over spills or negligence. ''The safe harbor provision does not jeopardize a single lawsuit,'' the lobbying group said in its memorandum, saying it would apply only to defective product suits. The Senate has not previously backed the liability protection. MTBE has been widely added to gasoline as an oxygenate since the 1990's in an effort to reduce emissions, but it has been found to leak from underground gas tanks. Its health risks are disputed, but California has called for its elimination there by the end of the year and 16 other states, including New York, are also moving to phase it out. Both the House and Senate energy bills provide millions of dollars to remove underground storage tanks. Despite resistance to giving MTBE manufacturers legal help, the legislative handling of the issue is critical to the fate of the energy measure since it is tied to a plan to increase the use of corn-based ethanol as a substitute gasoline additive. Ethanol is a key ingredient to building political support for the measure by winning backing from farm-state lawmakers. While the battle over MTBE provided Republicans writing the bill with their first significant obstacle to coming to terms, lawmakers and aides said the disagreement could be worked out as early as Friday. On another central issue, those writing the bill said they were close to agreement on a restructuring of the electric utility industry -- though they would not provide details. Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico and chairman of the negotiations, released a statement with Mr. Tauzin today saying they hoped to wrap up the bill by the end of next week. ''We have made excellent progress on this energy conference,'' they said. ''We have now released discussion drafts on every major issue except ethanol and electricity. While we have not finalized those drafts, we hope to do so in the next couple of days.'' The idea of finishing next week upset Democrats who are angry about being cut out of the negotiations and now face the prospect of only one more formal meeting of the joint conference committee. ''I am particularly dismayed that the Republicans still expect only one meeting at the end of next week to ratify a final product that we have not yet seen,'' said Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee."
"Early in the 17th century, Dutch settlers bought a large piece of land from the Maspet Indian tribe along what is now known as Newtown Creek. The tribe, whose name survives in the Queens neighborhood Maspeth, might have been eager to make the deal, given that they called the area ''at the bad water place.'' It is not known why they disparaged the creek back then. But the reasons to do so now are plain. Despite being long past its prime as a shipping hub, Newtown Creek, which forms the northern border between Brooklyn and Queens, is a 4.3-mile waterborne theme park for the remnants of industrial abuse. In fact, Alex Matthiessen, the executive director of Riverkeeper, an environmental group, said the creek was so polluted that ''there is a defeatist attitude'' about it in government agencies. Maureen Wren, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, disagreed, saying that it inspects facilities to make sure the water regulations are followed, investigates possible polluters and works to clean up contaminated sites. But Riverkeeper has taken matters into its own hands. Two months ago, it sent letters to five companies that operate on the creek -- a cement plant, a scrap yard, a beverage distributor, a construction supply company and a recycling plant -- announcing that it planned to sue them for violating the federal Clean Water Act if each company did not at least come up with a cleanup plan by the end of December. Although most of the companies denied any polluting, Mr. Matthiessen says the letter has gotten results. One of the companies was Allocco Recycling, which decontaminates soil and pulverizes used concrete in a plant that abuts the creek at the end of Kingsland Avenue. Kenneth Reiss, a spokesman, said the company cooperated with Riverkeeper even though its operations were not harming the water. ''We spent $150,000 to increase the size of our bulkhead and raise it up to prevent any further erosion,'' he said. ''We even put netting underneath our outdoor conveyor belt.'' Mr. Matthiessen is cheered by such actions, but said much more needs to be done. The creek is bordered by 160 properties, he said, and his group is sending out more letters. Ms. Wren said the conservation department was cleaning up the Phelps Dodge site, which has been designated by the federal government as a highly toxic site, and pressed for a continuing $2 billion improvement to the large Newtown Creek Sewage Treatment Plant. As for Allocco Recycling, ''D.E.C. did investigate that thoroughly,'' she said, and determined that ''there were no discharge or outfalls.'' If these pollution fighters succeed, Bill Schuck, an art teacher and kayaker who lives on Commercial Street in Greenpoint, may be among the first to know. ''There are slicks of garbage around where I put the kayak in,'' he said. ''There might be condoms and wooden pallets floating in the water. Further down the creek, it gets really polluted and still.'' JIM O'GRADY NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK WATERWAYS"
"WHEN the outrage over Love Canal was at its height, more than 20 years ago, hundreds of families had to be evacuated from their homes after 21,000 tons of chemicals buried beneath them started oozing into their basements and contaminating their groundwater. Today, families are once again settled in the same neighborhood in upstate New York, now rechristened Black Creek Village. They live in neat, new ranch houses and federal officials recently announced that they now consider this notorious symbol of industrial pollution clean. But what does clean mean when the pollutants that rendered Love Canal dangerous to humans remain exactly where they were? In fact, there is no accepted standard, and clean, in practical terms, often means still polluted -- but in a different and less dangerous way. The Environmental Protection Agency, for example, has deleted 278 sites from the 1,200 on the Superfund national priorities list (the fund itself was created partly in reaction to Love Canal). Each has been defined as clean in a different way, and with few exceptions the offending pollutants were never removed. What makes the notion of clean so slippery is the relative newness of the idea of decontaminating industrial sites and the unpalatable truth that treating pollution, even rendering it harmless, almost never means getting rid of it. The sin, once committed, cannot be entirely undone, and this is something no one really wants to hear. Politicians ''can't politically make the jump to telling the public that they have to accept a certain amount of contamination,'' said Michael B. Moore, an environmental consultant from Vermont who is chairman of the Superfund task force of the National Ground Water Association, a professional group with a special interest in cleaning up contaminated sites. When federal officials put Love Canal on the Superfund list, some residents thought they knew what clean meant. ''We were led to believe that they were going to go in with bulldozers, take 20,000 tons of waste out of Love Canal and clean up the neighborhood so we could live there,'' said Lois Marie Gibbs, whose home had to be demolished because the ground beneath it dripped with chemicals. Never having undertaken a project like Love Canal, federal officials had no idea how much contamination was buried there until they started testing the soil. They quickly realized that the volume of hazardous waste was enormous, and that removing the rusting and dented chemical drums was riskier than leaving them there. Then, in a pattern followed at many other sites, the government and the Hooker Chemical Company (now the Occidental Chemical Corporation), capped the chemical swamp with a thick layer of clay, installed pumps and drains to control runoff and ripped up miles of contaminated sewer pipe. The chemicals themselves were left in the ground, surrounded by a cyclone fence. Jane M. Kenny, the E.P.A. regional administrator, insisted that no standards were lowered in removing Love Canal from the Superfund list. Even though the chemicals haven't been removed, she said, the $400 million cleanup has contained the pollution and reduced the health risks, which is the cleanup standard the agency aims for. ''I know that saying clean makes people crazy,'' she said, ''but in terms of Love Canal, the area is now protective of the environment, the site is contained and we believe that we have eliminated the exposure.'' The chasm between the government's definition of clean and community expectations hasn't narrowed in 20 years. ''If she says Love Canal's cleaned up, that's just a blatant lie,'' said Ms. Gibbs, now executive director of the Center for Health, Environment and Justice, which works with communities facing environmental problems.'' When Congress established the Superfund in 1980, it deliberately refrained from setting a single standard, insisting only that the E.P.A. protect health and the environment in a cost-effective way. The gold standard was a level of cleanliness where there was only a one in a million chance that there would be more cancer in the area than normal. But that was not a practical goal at many cleanup sites, including Love Canal, where the level of risk of additional cancers is now reckoned at one in 10,000. The E.P.A. will not certify a site as clean in which the risk of additional cancers exceeds one in 10,000. The term brownfields is another way of defining clean and saying the politically unspeakable -- that a certain amount of contamination will always be with us. Brownfields are former industrial sites that are cleaned just enough so the remaining risk is compatible with the way the land will be reused. Owners get to define clean one way if they intend to build, say, a parking lot, and another if they plan to build homes. It is yet another way of saying clean, and still polluted."
"Eighty years ago, the smelter that anchors this company town was at the center of a dispute over whether a Canadian company could be held liable for environmental damage it caused in the United States. The United States was awarded damages in that case, which endures as a landmark in international environmental law. But now the same smelter is the focus of a new dispute between the two countries. The current impasse concerns nearly 20 million tons of industrial waste that the Trail smelter dumped into the Columbia River over the course of 100 years. The river carried much of it 10 miles across the border and into Washington State. In December, the Environmental Protection Agency ordered the smelter's Canadian parent company, Teck Cominco, to study the health risks of contamination in the upper Columbia and assess cleanup options. The company responded by telling the agency that it had no obligation to honor United States law. The Canadian government also entered the fray with a formal diplomatic letter to the State Department asking that the environmental agency, in effect, back off. Canada, the letter said, is concerned that the agency's stance ''may set an unfortunate precedent by causing transboundary environmental liability cases to be initiated in both Canada and the United States.'' Daniel Bodansky, a professor at the University of Georgia and an expert on international environmental law, said the earlier Trail smelter case might be the best framework for understanding the current one. Otherwise, he said, ''there's very little precedent for successful litigation of transboundary pollution cases.'' In the earlier case, farmers in the United States concerned about their crops began complaining in the early 1920's about fumes drifting south from the Cominco smelter. The American government took up their cause, and the dispute was referred to the International Joint Commission, a rarely used arbitration panel, and then to a separate tribunal convened by the two countries. The United States was eventually awarded $428,000 in damages. More important, though, was the tribunal's finding that under international law no nation could allow activity in its territory that caused serious damage to another country. The current smelter conflict began when the Environmental Protection Agency's regional office in Seattle conducted a routine study of possible contamination of the Columbia. Last year, after a request by local Indian tribes, the office completed a partial survey of the upper Columbia, which for 135 miles upstream of the Grand Coulee Dam is a vast recreational area known as Lake Roosevelt, popular with boaters, anglers and campers. The survey found elevated levels of arsenic, lead, mercury and other contaminants in the lake, enough for it to qualify as a Superfund site. The study also determined that the Trail smelter was the ''primary source of contamination to the upper Columbia River,'' making the company potentially liable for cleanup and exposing it to lawsuits. One of Teck Cominco's United States subsidiaries, Teck Cominco American of Spokane, Wash., offered to pay for a $13 million study of the possible health risks posed by contamination in Lake Roosevelt if the agency would defer pursuing a cleanup under Superfund law. For a while it seemed that this offer might lead to a solution, but negotiations between the company and the agency's regional office broke down. The regional office, on the advice of government lawyers, then ordered Teck Cominco to begin planning for further studies and a possible cleanup. John Iani, the environmental agency's regional administrator, said the company's proposal did not meet the agency's standards for site testing and cleanup. Teck Cominco says the $13 million offer is still on the table. Doug Horswill, the company's senior vice president for environment and public affairs, said the agency had broken off discussions without explanation. ''We're not shirking our responsibilities whatsoever in this matter,'' he said. [Discussions are now under way in Washington and Ottawa involving the Environmental Protection Agency and the State and Justice Departments. Mr. Horswill said that any agreement would probably be between Canada and Teck Cominco, but that it would have to satisfy United States expectations that the lake be cleaned up.] A legacy of mistrust between residents of the upper Columbia and the smelter dates to the earlier quarrel, when farmers complained of crops being ruined by sulfur dioxide from the smelter's smokestacks. In the current case, some fear that the smelter may have created a lasting health problem for residents of the upper Columbia basin. Walking recently along a snow-crusted Columbia riverbank just south of the border, Robert Jackman of the local environmental group Citizens for a Clean Columbia picked up a handful of black, glassy sand by the water's edge and let it sift through his fingers. ''This whole area is slag,'' he said. Slag, a thick, grainy discharge, is a byproduct of smelting that contains lead, zinc, copper and other metals. From 1896 to 1995, operating within Canadian and provincial law, the smelter discharged nearly 20 million tons of it into the Columbia. Much of that made its way into the United States. Teck Cominco has maintained that the slag is inert, and sells it as an ingredient in concrete. The Environmental Protection Agency asserts that it could have a negative impact on wildlife and visitors at Lake Roosevelt. Mr. Jackman, 77, said the potential health risks along Lake Roosevelt had been ignored for too long. ''We feel that our health concerns are not being properly dealt with,'' he said. But some others in the basin fear that the agency is rushing forward without any evidence of the risks of contamination, and that an agency cleanup could devastate the local economy, which is heavily dependent on tourism. Merrill Ott, a Stevens County, Wash., commissioner, said it was wrong for the environmental agency to pursue Teck Cominco without being certain that the lake posed a health risk. ''People have been playing in the lake, people have been fishing in the lake, people have been swimming in the lake for 60 years,'' he said, ''and now all of a sudden there is a human health hazard?''"
"This village, best known as the birthplace of I.B.M., has an unusual look these days. Venting systems, with white plastic tubing that runs from basements to roofs, sprout from 377 houses and businesses. Many houses are for sale, but there are few buyers. ''This area is taboo now,'' said Tim Davis, who lives on Monroe Avenue. ''And it's going to stay that way.'' Mr. Davis lives in what residents call ''the plume'' -- 320 acres encompassing the downtown and stretching across the village, all of which were polluted by industrial toxic substances. The chemicals contaminated soil and leached into groundwater. And they continue to produce vapors that waft into hundreds of basements. Occurring over decades, the pollution is traceable at least in part to I.B.M., which used common solvents in its circuit board assembly. The venting systems were all paid for by I.B.M., which two decades ago employed 12,000 workers in Endicott, just west of Binghamton. Now 1,700 collect I.B.M. paychecks here. Still, residents say they feel trapped in virtually unsalable homes, where they fear the prolonged effects of the vapors on the health of their families. ''Your house acts as a kind of chimney'' for the vapors, which have tested positive for the contaminant trichloroethene, or TCE, said Alan Turnbull, 69, who in 2002 created the Residents Action Group of Endicott, also known as R.A.G.E., after his wife, Donna Turnbull, 57, was found to have throat cancer. Ms. Turnbull does not smoke, and she used to exercise regularly in her finished basement. Now, she rarely ventures down the basement stairs. That the TCE found in Endicott, a suspected carcinogen, has been measured at very low levels is scant comfort to those worried about more than two decades of exposure. ''Oh, sure, we're scared to death,'' said Ms. Turnbull, who has lived in her Cleveland Avenue home for 21 years. ''We know the chemicals are dangerous, but we don't know how dangerous or the long-term effects.'' Results of air quality tests from homes in 2002 prompted the state environmental officials to announce in January that the Endicott pollution was more serious than previously believed. The State Department of Environmental Conservation said it would upgrade Endicott's status from Class 4 -- meaning that the pollution source is no longer a problem, but is still being monitored -- to Class 2 -- a significant threat to the environment or health. The reclassification, backed by United States Representative Maurice Hinchey, a Democrat who represents the area, was a victory for citizen groups. Despite the change, state health officials cannot say whether air or water pollution in Endicott has actually caused any health problems. Village officials say tests show that the water is safe to drink. And the venting systems are effective, according to Michael Fraser, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Conservation. Still, many residents remain pessimistic. ''This is going to become a dead town, no doubt about it,'' said Matt Latessa, 62, who owns a house in the plume and a men's hair salon on Monroe Avenue. Aging business owners such as Mr. Latessa, who wants to move to Florida, and families that bought starter homes in the plume feel trapped. ''We're being held hostage,'' he said. Along with for-sale signs on front lawns, the venting systems, which emit a humming sound, have become a fact of life. Mr. Davis's house on Monroe Avenue, in the heart of the plume, is one of those that is vented. ''If you noticed, there's a Remax sign in front of my home,'' said Mr. Davis, who is troubled by persistent eye irritation. ''I put it there instantly'' after learning of the vapor problem, he said, but he added that he has had no offers for the house. Mr. Fraser said vapor intrusion was one of the factors that made the Endicott situation unique. ''In past years, the guidance provided to regulatory agencies indicated that established cleanup levels were also protective for indoor air,'' Mr. Fraser said. ''Advances in science and technology have recently shown that vapor intrusion concerns can accompany TCE-contaminated groundwater at very low levels.'' For more than two decades, I.B.M. used liquid cleaning agents in its circuit board assembly operation. A half-dozen spills and leaks, including a documented 1979 leak of 4,100 gallons from an underground tank, left behind volatile organic compounds in the town's soil and aquifer. Trace elements of volatile organic compounds have been found in the city's drinking water , but the levels are within regulatory limits To date, I.B.M.'s former campus has been identified by the Department of Environmental Conservation as the major source of pollution, Mr. Fraser said. However, the state agency has also traced some contaminants to a local dry cleaner and is seeking out other polluters. Since 1980, I.B.M. has pumped out 78,000 gallons of chemicals, including trichloroethane, trichloroethene, Freon, benzene and perchloroethene. The village is now dotted with 342 wells, paid for by I.B.M., that monitor or extract groundwater. I.B.M. has already spent ''tens of millions'' and has pledged to work with the village, said a company spokesman, Todd Martin. ''We are going to proceed through this project as a partner with the community and other stakeholders,'' Mr. Martin said. Before I.B.M. installed the venting systems early last year, ''we met one on one with residents at their kitchen tables. We want to connect with people,'' said Mr. Martin. Opinion is divided on whether I.B.M., which sold all its Endicott real estate but leases land for its operations there, remains a good neighbor or has become a disengaged corporate parent. Endicott never served as I.B.M. headquarters, but is called the company birthplace because that is the site of the first plant. ''There are two I.B.M.'s,'' Mr. Turnbull said. ''In their early days, their philosophy was to take the best care of their employees.'' By the 80's, he said, ''a new I.B.M. came forward. That's the one that cares about the bottom line.'' The village's mayor maintains that working with I.B.M. is the best way forward. ''I say, thank God I.B.M. is here to take care of this mess, '' Mayor Joan Hickey Pulse said. Residents should not lose sight of the fact that spills and leaks were accidental, she said. ''I feel I.B.M. will spend any amount of money to clean this up.'' The mayor also rejects the notion that Endicott is on the ropes. ''We're not going to put up gates and say Endicott is closed,'' she said. ''Endicott is not going to go away.'' Citizens continue to pack monthly forums held by the Department of Environmental Conservation and the State Department of Health. Among other things, the community has reached an agreement with the State Department of Health and the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry to conduct a study profiling the health of villagers and looking at cancer cases and other illnesses. Cancer comprises a complex range of diseases with varying triggers, including old age. Connecting individual cases to environmental exposure is problematic, a fact acknowledged by Bernadette Patrick, who helped organize Citizens Acting to Restore Endicott's Environment. Ms. Patrick said she has never been ''a save-the-planet kind of person.'' But that changed after her daughter, Nicole Brinsko, was found to have Hodgkin's lymphoma at 17, which announced itself with a large swelling on her neck. ''My daughter was conceived, born and raised in the plume on Tracy Street,'' Ms. Patrick said. She began to ask questions after she contacted another mother whose teenage daughter also grew up on Tracy Street and who developed bone cancer. Nicole is now in college and is growing a head of baby-fine black hair. ''Having cancer when you are 17 and wearing a wig to the senior prom is not normal,'' she said. ''The whole situation isn't normal.'' Another Tracy Street resident, Patrick Campbell, 38, has testicular cancer and is H.I.V. positive. He blames the village air and drinking water for his fragile health. ''I'll be lucky to make it to 40,'' he said. He said other families on Tracy Street have packed up and left. ''I call it Emptycott,'' Mr. Campbell said. Today I.B.M.'s once impressive campus has a deserted look. But people have not forgotten the good old days. ''In the 60's and 70's, I.B.M. took care of the area,'' said Edward Blaine, a Deacon at St. Ambrose Catholic Church in downtown Endicott and a member of R.A.G.E. ''We had things other communities didn't have: weekly concerts, the carousel and the golf course. We went from being a great place to raise a family to where we are today. Now that choice has a dark side to it.''"
"The Defense Department and the Environmental Protection Agency have squared off in a continuing dispute over the danger from a widespread contaminant of groundwater. Billions of dollars in cleanup costs are at stake. The contaminant is ammonium perchlorate, an additive that NASA and the Pentagon used for rocket fuel and munitions starting in the 1950's. For disposal, perchlorate was often dissolved in water and poured on the ground because officials did not consider low levels hazardous for people. Perchlorate remains in use and is unregulated. Traces of perchlorate have been found in groundwater from California to Maryland. It has been detected in the Colorado River, which provides water to more than 15 million people in the Southwest. In addition, low levels have been found in some lettuce samples and milk around the country, the Food and Drug Administration said. According to Pentagon documents, perchlorate was used in 49 states, with contamination found in 30; Vermont appears to be the sole state where it was not used. Perchlorate has medical and military uses. It is used to treat Graves' disease, the thyroid disorder, because it suppresses certain hormones. Officials and scientists dispute whether the amounts in groundwater, usually 4 to 100 parts per billion, are enough to suppress hormone levels in people, which fluctuate slightly anyway. Scientists at the E.P.A. say that although variations may have few effects on healthy adults, they may hurt the development of fetuses and young children. A study by the Arizona Department of Health Services found that newborns in Yuma, which obtains its water from the perchlorate-contaminated Colorado River at levels of about five parts per billion, were more likely to have abnormal thyroid functions than the babies who were born in Flagstaff, which does not have such water. The environmental agency's findings on perchlorate have come under vigorous attack from the Pentagon, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the weapons industry. ''We have reviewed the E.P.A. risk assessment, and we think the document is biased, unrealistic and scientifically imbalanced,'' said Col. Dan Rogers of the Air Force, chief of the environmental law and litigation division at the Pentagon. Olga M. Dominguez, a deputy assistant administrator at NASA, said, ''We do not believe the E.P.A. has used good science.'' The Pentagon and the industry say the environmental agency is being overly conservative by not looking at the relevant physiological effects, but instead at a precursor change in the body. Scientists at the agency, say they are considering the most sensitive populations, including fetuses. Dr. Paul Gilman, assistant administrator for science for the environmental agency, said, ''I've good confidence in the work that we have done.'' The environmental agency first raised concerns about perchlorate in 1985, when it found high concentrations of chemicals linked to munitions, including perchlorate, in the San Gabriel Valley in California. The agency found perchlorate contamination ranging from 50 parts per billion to 2,600 parts per billion in its test samples. The tests were never finalized because five of the six control samples, supposed to be perchlorate free, were contaminated. In one case, the control sample matched the highest contamination in the San Gabriel Valley samples. In 1993, the Pentagon teamed up with Kerr-McGee, Lockheed Martin and Aerojet, a GenCorp subsidiary, and others to form the Perchlorate Study Group to show that the environmental agency's science was wrong. In December the group released a study that compared birth records from California from 1983 to 1997 in Redlands, where perchlorate has been detected, with communities in San Bernardino and Riverside counties, where perchlorate has not been detected. The study found that there was no statistically valid difference in levels of thyroid hormone between the groups. The environmental agency has recommended no more than one part per billion in drinking water, equivalent to a grain of salt in an Olympic-size pool. The Pentagon and the industry are arguing for a human standard of 200 parts per billion. A standard of 200 parts per billion for people would probably exempt much of the contamination from cleanup, because most such contamination in the United States ranges from 4 to 100 parts per billion. The environmental agency's recommendation is largely based on a study of rats published in 2001 and financed in part by the Perchlorate Study Group. The study found crude effects on rats' brains from exposure to perchlorate. Parts of the brains were enlarged. Using a standard safety margin for people, the agency scientists arrived at the 1 part per billion. In the same study, benign tumors were spotted on two 19-week-old baby rats out of a group of 30 whose mothers had been exposed to high levels of perchlorate. Scientists from the environmental agency say it is unusual to see tumors in baby rats that young, leading them to believe that something must have occurred in the womb. The Pentagon and the industry say that the study was flawed because just one slice was taken per rat brain and that the baby rats' benign tumors are common enough to be a statistical anomaly. The level that the Pentagon wants is largely based on a 14-day study that exposed human adults to perchlorate. The Pentagon says the lowest level that showed an effect on the adults translates into 200 parts per billion, though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies using that study arrived at much lower levels. Ms. Dominguez of NASA said a program to clean up water contaminated with 1 part per billion would cost four times as much as a program for 32 parts per billion, though the differences in health risks are minimal. For the Colorado River alone, the Soil Water Air Protection Enterprise, an environmental consulting firm, estimated that a cleanup mounted to meet the E.P.A. standard would cost $40 billion over 10 years. Other jurisdictions are establishing safety levels similar to the environmental agency's. California has set an interim safety level of 2 to 6 parts per billion for drinking water, telling water systems not to go higher than 40 parts per billion. The toxicology branch of the disease control centers has a draft risk assessment that puts the safety level for medium-term exposure at three parts per billion. At least some Pentagon scientists have advocated safety levels similar to the environmental agency's. A study of rats in December 1995 by researchers at the Air Force Institute of Technology found that the level where no negative effects were observed, a standard in toxicology, was ''consistent with the assumptions made by the E.P.A.'' The deputy for cleanup, munitions and environmental technology at the Pentagon, Lt. Col. Jeff Cornell of the Air Force, said the study was important though ''there was not a consensus position developed.'' In 2003 the White House referred the debate to the National Academy of Sciences which set up a panel to study the issue. The original chairman of the panel, Dr. Gilbert S. Omenn, a professor at University of Michigan, resigned after he learned that he served on the board of a company that had started developing a technology to clean up perchlorate. Two scientists on the panel, Dr. Richard Bull, an adjunct professor at Washington State University, and Dr. Charles Capen of Ohio State University, have consulted for Lockheed Martin on perchlorate. The National Academy of Sciences says the previous work does not constitute a conflict of interest. ''We eliminate conflicts of interest,'' said Dr. James J. Reisa, director of environmental studies and toxicology at the academy. ''We don't try to eliminate bias. We try to balance it.'' Even as the battle continues, the Pentagon has begun exploring legal options to delay or avoid cleanups, in part because states are starting to set their own standards. In 2003, the Pentagon lobbied Congress for several exemptions from federal environmental laws, including one that covers cleanups of explosive residue at operational sites, a legal description that could be used to include perchlorate. Though the perchlorate exemption was not one of the two exemptions attached to other legislation, the Pentagon has said it will push for it again. In addition, a perchlorate policy distributed in June by a deputy assistant secretary of defense, John P. Woodley Jr., hints at its next strategy, claiming legal immunity as part of the federal government. The policy said the Pentagon would comply with state legal requirements to respond to perchlorate only ''to the extent that Congress has clearly and unambiguously authorized a waiver'' of immunity from lawsuits, hinting that the Pentagon will act only if there is a regulation, not just a recommendation. ''They've retreated to the next trench, which is to fight a legal battle either in the courts or in Congress to wipe out their liability,'' Erik Olson, a lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said. ''It's clear they are not going to voluntarily fix this problem. They are going to be forced to fix it.'' Correction: March 11, 2004, Thursday An article in Science Times on March 2 about groundwater contamination from ammonium perchlorate, an additive used in rocket fuel and munitions, misstated the origin of a policy document suggesting that the Pentagon might claim immunity from federal pollution laws. It was circulated by Maj. Gen. Larry J. Lust of the Army, not by John P. Woodley Jr., an assistant secretary of defense."
"For nearly half a century, a pumping station in South Florida has been pouring millions of gallons of storm runoff annually into the Everglades, keeping the farms and backyards of western Broward Country dry but filling the wetlands with water often tainted by pollutants, mainly from phosphorus-rich fertilizers. The station, known as S-9, is not a filthy factory, leaching mine or toxic dump. It is a large pump in a squat, nondescript building at the intersection of two levees. But its role in raising the level of phosphorus in the Everglades puts it at the center of a Supreme Court battle that could end up changing the reach of the Clean Water Act, the landmark 1972 law that established a federally controlled system for keeping the nation's waterways clean. The core question is this: Is S-9 a polluter, subject to regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency and state agencies that protect the nation's water supply? Or is it merely a neutral conveyor of water, a cog in a vital infrastructure that, along with thousands of other water systems, keeps flood plains dry and reservoirs full while slaking the thirst of cities, subdivisions and farms? The court, which will hear arguments on Wednesday in a lawsuit brought by a small Indian tribe against Florida water authorities, will decide whether, legally speaking, the pump is adding pollutants to the Everglades or is simply transferring them between bodies of water that belong to the same large national system of waterways. If the court decides the pump adds pollutants, S-9 and similar pumping equipment could become subject to a stringent system of permits and pollution controls required under the Clean Water Act. The court is stepping in at a time when the nation's water agencies and developers are engaged in huge efforts to tap and reroute water to quench the thirst of expanding suburban communities. The lawsuit was filed six years ago by the 500-member Miccosukee tribe, which argued that high levels of phosphorus in the runoff are imperiling the ecosystem of the Everglades, where the tribe has lived since the early 1800's. The Miccosukee (mik-ko-SUE-kee), whose tribal headquarters sits on the Tamiami Trail in the Everglades in western Dade County, won federal recognition in 1962. In due course, they built a gambling business. This gave them the financial wherewithal, one tribal elder said, to mount a series of legal assaults on the South Florida Water Management District, which operates the pump. One lawsuit took aim at S-9, whose discharge of phosphorus in recent years has averaged 20 parts per billion, twice the level at which many native plants thrive. In 2002, a federal judge ruled that the pump should be regulated under a section of the Clean Water Act requiring ''point'' sources of pollution -- like factories and mines -- to obtain permits under a program run by states. The suit, now before the Supreme Court, pits the Bush administration -- which filed a brief in support of the water district -- and a broad array of city water planners, Western water districts and 11 Western states, led by Colorado and New Mexico, against 14 mostly Eastern states, led by New York and Pennsylvania, as well as the Association of State Wetlands Managers and environmental groups like the National Wildlife Federation. The Eastern and Midwestern states that have sided with the Miccosukee have an abundance of water and of polluting industries, and thus a keen interest in controlling water quality. New York, for example, filed a brief in the case arguing that the states needed to ensure that their ''finely tuned programs to assess, protect and improve the water quality of each surface water body within their borders are not frustrated.'' But in the arid West and Southwest, where states must devise elaborate ways to transport large amounts of water over long distances, merely getting enough water is often the most pressing need. These states have sided with the Water Management District in South Florida, fearing that many structures that bring water to dry ranches and suburbs will be newly regulated. So has New York City, whose water comes from an intricate network of upstate reservoirs. The city argues that its supplies could be threatened if silt-laden water was subject to quality tests as it moved through tunnels en route to city taps. Supporters of the Miccosukees argue that if the tribe loses, the regulatory framework that keeps waterways clean would be undone. The tribe's opponents focus on the need to be nimble in controlling the movement of water. What they fear is not the dismantling of needed regulatory controls but the imposition of what they see as new, superfluous requirements for federal permits that would usurp the states' rights and ability to manage their water resources. Strict permit rules, they fear, would bring delays, citizen lawsuits and requirements for expensive antipollution equipment. ''Take the worst-case scenario,'' said Robert Bennett, a spokesman for the Central Arizona Project, that state's major water agency. ''All of that is going to slow down and reduce the amount of water we could deliver. The sucking sound you hear would be the people of Phoenix turning on their taps.'' The Miccosukee say their goal is to protect the Everglades by forcing the water district to get a permit for the pump and, eventually, to detoxify its discharge. For now, the Everglades appear to be healthy along the Tamiami Trail. About 50 miles to the northeast, where sugar cane and sod fields bound the wetlands and the runoff is laced with higher concentrations of phosphorus, the Everglades have become a very different place. Thick, tall stands of cattails, which thrive on phosphorus, have elbowed out the saw grass, and many other kinds of plants and fish have vanished. ''The cattails show the destruction of everything,'' said Ronald D. Jones, an Everglades expert who is a professor of biology at Portland State University. Gary Goforth, the chief consulting engineer for the Everglades Construction Project, disagrees. The water district is fulfilling the mandates of the state's Everglades Forever Act, Mr. Goforth says, by building containment areas that use a variety of methods to remove phosphorus, including biological allies like underwater plants and surface algae. In addition to their gambling business, the Miccosukees have a modest tourist operation offering traditional crafts, alligator wrestling and airboat tours of the Everglades. One airboat outfit bears the name of Buffalo Tiger, an 84-year-old tribal elder. While water managers and environmentalists see the battle over S-9 as a critical test of wills, for Buffalo Tiger cleaning up the Everglades is simply the right thing to do. But, he added: ''You can't fix it. You can only patch it up. Then in 30 to 50 years, you'll have to do it again.''"
"Big Spring Creek rises up out of the prairie at the cottonwood-tree-shaded state fish hatchery a few miles outside this agricultural hamlet. It oxbows several miles through farmland and pine-studded bluffs and into town, through neighborhoods and downtown. The deep, clear creek also flows through the center of life here. The water is piped without treatment into the faucets of city residents, fishermen come from around the country to drop flies into its pools, children and adults float the stream in inner tubes, and a local tavern has a hole in the floor a few steps from the bar which allows patrons to watch swimming fish while they drink. ''Lewistown wouldn't be here if it weren't for Big Spring Creek,'' said Torger Oaas, a local lawyer. That is why high levels of toxic PCB's found in the stream and their unlikely source have sent a ripple of shock through this central Montana town of 4,000. PCB's were first discovered in the stream in the early 1990's, but at low levels. An advisory was placed on eating fish. But after an old industrial site at Brewery Flats, which officials thought was the likely source, was cleaned up, they kept finding PCB's. Last year, they started sampling above the flats, which no one had thought to do before. ''The levels got higher and higher the closer you got to the hatchery,'' said Don Skaar, a pollution control biologist with the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. ''We sampled fish right below the hatchery and they had levels 30 times the 'no eat' levels. It was totally out of the blue.'' The problem turned out to be the blue-green paint that was used on the walls of the hatchery. Since the 1960's the paint, with high levels of PCB's that were added to make it more elastic, has been flaking off the concrete walls at the hatchery, washing downstream and accumulating in a toxic layer of sediment, a foot below the creek bottom in some places. PCB's were classified as a ''probable carcinogen'' by the federal government and banned in 1977. The walls of the hatchery here were painted in 1959. Fish, Wildlife and Parks, which owns the hatchery, has drained and closed the raceways. Workers killed nearly three-quarters of a million young fish, tainted by the toxic paint, by herding them into a small area and adding lethal levels of a tranquilizer to the water. They also posted a ''do no eat'' order for all fish taken from the stream, which are not hatchery fish but have been contaminated by paint flakes there. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently took blood from more than a hundred local residents to test PCB levels. Results are due in October. The sudden appearance of a snake in what many thought of as Eden has been unsettling. ''When we moved here in 1985 my boy caught a big brown trout before we unloaded the truck,'' said Marty Paulson, a retired mail carrier. Big Spring Creek forms the back boundary of his yard. Every so often, Mr. Paulson said, he would catch a fish from his yard, clean it, roll it in corn flour and fry it up for dinner. No more. ''The last fish I caught was ugly,'' he said, shaking his head. ''It had a big head, a skinny little body and was green. I lost my appetite.'' The ''do not eat'' warning did not worry several fly fishermen who were casting flies into Big Spring Creek recently. Some had not seen the small signs warning against eating the fish. Others released all of their catch. One said he did not care. ''If I ate 10 fish a day for 40 years I guess I might be dead,'' Richard Hansen, an insurance adjuster from Lewistown, said with a shrug as he walked down a dirt road clad in tight brown neoprene waders. ''Otherwise it's not a big deal.'' But nearby property owners think it is big deal. ''What does it do to my property value?'' asked Bill Haugen, a general contractor whose backyard lawn rolls down to the stream. ''It adds doubt.'' Both Mr. Haugen and Mr. Paulson are part of a class-action lawsuit against the state and the Monsanto Company, which made the paint, and are represented by Mr. Oaas. They want the creek back the way it was, which would probably mean dredging the bottom, especially near the hatchery. The fish, on the other hand, may have high PCB levels for five years or more. A lawyer representing Monsanto did not return calls seeking comment. There was considerable talk about the PCB's at the Montana Tavern, on Lewistown's Main Street, which has an unusual connection to the stream. The creek runs under the streets of downtown Lewistown for three blocks or so before it emerges into the open. There is a wooden box with a plexiglass top over a hole in the tavern floor that looks down on the stream, where a spotlight illuminates the long sleek bodies of trout. Jim Awbery, the bar's owner, said his son once caught a six-pound brown trout in the hole. Mr. Awbery said people had come from all over to see the bar with a trout stream underneath. And PCB's or not, he said, ''they'll keep coming.'' Lewistown Journal"
"WITH the presidential election likely to be decided in swing states, how Long Island votes on Tuesday may be of local interest only in a state seen as all but certain to cast its electoral votes for the Democratic candidate, Senator John Kerry. But the ballots in Nassau and Suffolk and in the towns of Oyster Bay and Brookhaven will present residents with choices on environmental bond issues with a combined value of $255 million, the largest amount ever for such initiatives in a single election. On the line are bond issues of $50 million in Nassau, $75 million in Suffolk, $30 million in Oyster Bay and $100 million in Brookhaven that would be used to preserve open lands, farms, parks and parklands and protect water and fragile habitats. In both the counties and the towns, the proposals have extensive backing from environmental, business and civic groups and broad support among elected officials, including Nassau County Executive Thomas S. Suozzi, Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy and the elected town leaders. Even developers have expressed support or stayed neutral. Desmond Ryan, the executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island in Hauppauge, a developers' lobby, said the group was taking no position on any of the bonds. With a Long Island voting history of overwhelming support for preservation initiatives on the ballot, backers of the bond issues said prospects for passage were good. The opposition may come from voters feeling battered by taxes or skeptical that governments will spend the bond proceeds properly. Paul Rabinovitch, the executive director of the Long Island chapter of the Nature Conservancy, said there was some worry about how the public might perceive $255 million in bonds for environmental purposes. ''It's not that we are doing something bigger than has been the practice on Long Island over the course of recent years,'' he said. ''This is about staying the course.'' In Suffolk, the originator on Long Island and a leader in the country of large-scale preservation programs that county voters have embraced again and again, a proposed $75 million bond issue for farm development rights, open space and parkland comes with a significant new twist. For the first time, the county would be permitted to transfer development rights from open space and parkland it purchased with money from the bond. Those development rights would be used to promote affordable housing in downtown areas, on unused commercial or industrial properties and in other locations where town and village governments agreed to such projects. The piggybacking of affordable housing on an environmental initiative of the kind that has proved popular with voters in the past gave some environmental groups pause. While there was no inherent conflict between preserving land and building less expensive housing, they said, mixing the two in the proposition might confuse voters and lessen support. But with Suffolk scraping the bottom of previously approved funds and more than 6,500 acres in the land and rights purchase pipeline, the groups have signed on in support. Mr. Levy helped with a pledge that the development rights would be used exclusively for housing costing less than $250,000, and in no cases built on the same open spaces or farms that the county has sought to preserve. Mr. Levy and backers led by members of his Workforce Housing Commission, where the transfer proposal originated, said the transfer option avoided wasting development rights and instead put them to use in addressing a crippling shortage of affordable homes. ''We think we are on to something here in that we can help deal with the affordable housing crisis while also further protecting the environment,'' Mr. Levy said. The original version did not include the rights transfer. It was added at the last moment at the behest of Mr. Levy's housing commission in a bond bill sponsored by Vivian Viloria-Fisher, a Democratic county legislator from Setauket, and approved unanimously. Richard Amper, the executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens, said Mr. Levy's pledge on how the transferred rights would be used had been critical to winning support. ''There is no conflict between affordable housing and open space preservation,'' Mr. Amper said. ''They complement each other and their common enemy is suburban sprawl.'' The transfer program, now being devised by the county planning department, would allow builders to acquire the development rights from the county and redeem them in areas without sewers for greater housing density than would otherwise be allowed by the county's sanitary code. Under that code, the county has jurisdiction over land that is not connected to sewers. But towns and villages control zoning and final approvals of developments. Although many downtown areas are connected to sewers and therefore beyond the scope of the transfers, Suffolk's planning director, Thomas A. Isles, said there were a large number of suitable locations without sewers across the county. The Suffolk bond issue includes $35 million for farmland development rights, which would not be subject to transfer, as well as $30 million for open space and $10 million for parks and greenswards. The bond issue would increase taxes for an average homeowner by about $10.50 a year for 20 years. According to a Suffolk County planning department report released last year, the county has preserved more than 27,000 acres of farms and open space since the 1970's at a cost of nearly $400 million, or more than all but a handful of states have spent for such purposes over the same period. The record has been very different in Nassau County, where the $50 million county bond proposition on the ballot is a first. Mr. Suozzi said he envisioned proceeds would be used to buy development rights to a handful of surviving farms, enhance county parks and control storm water runoff. He said a goal would be matching the money with federal, state and town funds. At Meyer's Farm in Woodbury, a 10-acre farm the Meyer family has farmed since 1924, Pete Meyer said much discussion lay ahead before the family sold development rights or entered into a government-sponsored preservation program. ''No one knows what's going on yet,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''It's all new, this stuff.'' The farm and farm stand, the only remaining agricultural spread in the Woodbury area, are on the county's short list if the bond issue is approved. Environmental groups had asked the county to consider a $100 million bond issue and gave county officials the results of a poll they conducted in June that showed 66 percent of residents would support a large environmental bond issue when its benefits were explained. ''It's a small investment when you think about how much land we can protect and how many parks we can improve,'' said Lisa Ott, the executive director of the North Shore Land Alliance in Old Westbury. Mr. Suozzi said he believed $50 million was more appropriate. ''This is the first time the county has even done something like this, and I thought it was important we do it a step at a time,'' he said. Judy Jacobs, the presiding officer of the Nassau County Legislature and a Democrat from Woodbury, said that the amount of the bond issue was calculated to increase its chances of passing. ''We felt that $50 million was a figure we could handle,'' she said. ''We'd like it to pass, and we don't want to hit people with something that seems to be above and beyond what is normal. I wish it could have been more.'' The Nassau bond issue would cost the average property owner about $7 a year for 20 years. In Oyster Bay, the $30 million bond issue proposed by the town would cost $16 a year over 30 years for the average property owner. It includes $15 million for land acquisition and $15 million for park improvements. In 2000, town voters overwhelmingly approved a $30 million bond issue for the same purposes. Sprawling Brookhaven, which is larger than Nassau County and is a hotbed of housing development, has proposed $100 million in spending to buy up open space and protect groundwater. Civic groups in the town have rallied in support of the measure, but the town's reputation for corruption -- earning it the nickname Crookhaven -- and the sheer size of the bond issue may be factors in the vote. It would cost the average property owner an estimated $39 a year for 30 years. Voters approved a $20 million environmental bond issue in 2002. John J. LaValle, the town supervisor, said he expected the bond issue to pass. ''We are receiving overwhelming support from our residents,'' he said. ''It's been a matter of educating the public as to what the challenges are and how we are going to deal with overdevelopment and traffic congestion and burdens on our schools. People seem to understand at this point that government cannot help unless it has the resources to do so.'' Dr. Lee Koppelman, the executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, estimated that 74,000 acres of open space in Suffolk and 5,000 acres in Nassau remained to be protected and in private hands. ''We will have to use every available tool, but if the suggestion is let's buy everything, it's just not going to happen,'' Dr. Koppelman said. Willing sellers and friendly negotiations would be keys, he said, to maximizing preservation. Long Island"
"Having just spent a morning cleaning up a beach, there are three things that, if I were the God Emperor of Dune, I would immediately outlaw: helium balloons, plastic foam and high-priced water. Not the items I expected to resent. As a child spending summers on Stinson Beach in California, I was paid a penny by my mother for every glass bottle I picked up. (I did it for doubly selfish reasons: I still have a two-inch scar in my left instep from a broken one I found the hard way.) In those days, coffee traveled in paper cups and the idea of paying $1 for water -- when I could fill my Boy Scout canteen for free -- would have been more ludicrous a prediction than hover-cars, talking robot maids and other fantasies from ''The Jetsons.'' Articles about beach trash over the years led me to expect acres of plastic bags and jugs studded with more evil items like syringes and fishing nets trailing dead dolphins. I have also seen lists of ''most-picked-up'' items: they are usually topped by cigarette butts and food wrappers. But I hadn't reckoned on where I was. I was visiting a perfect laboratory for detecting pure seagoing trash, the kind that migrates like terns or bluefish. It was an island off the New England coast with only 30 houses, no electricity, no paved roads and utterly empty beaches even on Labor Day weekend. (The locals, fearing discovery of their paradise, asked me not to name it, but it is the sort of longtime Yankee haunt where one might expect an introduction like ''Call me Ishmael.'') Cleanups in less pristine places are really beach-litter patrols. Cigarette butts and paper food wrappers don't travel far, since they absorb water and sink. If Coney Island is full of butts, it's because smokers are fouling their own nests. Syringes are actually quite rare, especially since hospitals have become much more careful with them. And on urban beaches, much of the trash is actually from the city's streets. Rainstorms carry it down storm sewers into rivers, which flow to the sea, which pushes it back. But on this islet there is no river, no sewer system, not even a public trash can. The residents compost their kitchen garbage and carry the rest by boat to a bigger island, where the dump is covered so carefully that there has been a major decline in the seagull population. Few smoke. And they have kept such sharp eyes on each other for generations that no one drops anything but names. Besides the foam egg cartons and green-capped water bottles, what astonished me was how much of the trash my group found was helium balloons -- Happy Birthday, Happy Halloween, Hiya Sponge Bob, Eat More Beef. One even betrayed its origin: ''Jack Orchulli for U.S. Senate.'' Mr. Orchulli is running in Connecticut, so the runaway had traversed at least two states and 45 miles of ocean. Piscatologists say the silvery Mylar ones are the worst. They travel farther and, like plastic bags, have been found clogging the intestines of sea turtles and pilot whales that mistook them for jellyfish or squid. With their tails of bright ribbon, they looked like big versions of the lures my hosts used for stripers. International Coastal Cleanup, based in Washington, has organized annual worldwide beach cleanups since 1986; this year's was on Sept. 18. Its volunteers work in teams, with one logging each type of trash. On its 2003 ''entangling debris'' list, balloon strings and ribbons accounted for 8 percent of the animals strangled. That is far behind fishing line and nets, which accounted for 60 percent, but at least fishing equipment has an excuse for being in the ocean and is not released just for fun. By contrast, balloons are not a problem in Long Beach, Calif., said Justin Rudd, who directs monthly volunteer cleanups of four miles of beach there. That is not surprising, since the prevailing winds are from the west. ''Styrofoam is the big culprit,'' Mr. Rudd said, along with fast-food packaging and plastic water bottles. The Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers end in Long Beach, and his problem is gutter runoff from 87 towns upstream. ''Right after a rainstorm, it's gross around here,'' he said. Like six-pack holders, which accounted for 16 percent of deadly entanglements, balloons cry out for a science-based solution. Seba Sheavly, director of International Coastal Cleanup, said the company that made most of the world's six-pack holders, ITW Hi-Cone, had made its products thinner and more prone to crack in prolonged sunlight. Not much has been done about balloon technology, she said, but her group opposes celebratory releases. ''Do it inside a gymnasium or a convention hall,'' she said. ''Not outdoors.'' She is similarly despairing about plastic foam. Even when it crumbles in the ocean, birds have been known to feed tiny particles to chicks because it resembles fish eggs. One of my cleanup teammates, Diana Walker, said the island used to get tides of plastic tampon applicators. Some years ago, disgusted, she mailed a box full to Playtex, which made most of them. The problem has largely gone away, she said. Playtex's director of consumer affairs, Martin Petersen, said the company introduced cardboard applicators 15 years ago that fall apart if they are flushed, but it still sells more plastic ones. They are now much less of a problem, he said, because the federal government forced cities to build sewage treatment plants in the 1990's. There were also fewer beer cans than I remember from childhood, presumably because of recycling. But there was still a lot of glass. One bit I found -- a flashbulb, still unpopped, made me feel like a paleontologist. I used to wrangle with my mother over whether each was worth a penny. But the whiskey, beer and salad dressing bottles had defied 40 years of fashion trends in trash, and looked much the same as they did in my childhood. Just thinking about them makes my foot hurt. COMMENTARY"
"In August 2001, an unusual legal drama began unfolding in federal court in White Plains. The agency that oversees New York City's vast water system pleaded guilty to violating the nation's environmental laws. It had discharged mercury-contaminated water for two years into a pool that flowed into an upstate reservoir and had allowed employees to use machinery contaminated with PCB's for more than a decade without protection. The judge took an extraordinary action: He appointed an outside monitor to supervise the agency's work. Then came the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and the case receded from public view. But the monitor, a former federal prosecutor who specialized in environmental cases, got to work, visiting reservoirs, interviewing employees, chasing anonymous tips and combing records. He also filed detailed reports with the judge. Now, three years later, those reports offer a revealing chronicle of violations, mishaps, oversights, and even low comedy by the agency, the Department of Environmental Protection, charged with protecting the safety of the city's drinking water. They also provide a detailed account of the inner workings of a city department, complete with byzantine office politics and assorted characters like the longtime manager who rejected a request for protective gear. The reports also charge that the agency failed to adequately discipline the veteran manager, who was also accused of undercutting efforts to comply with the law. The reports assert that even after its conviction, the department failed to properly document hazardous waste disposal, delayed cleaning up chemical spills and moved slowly to improve safety at a Bronx reservoir where an employee was sucked into a drainpipe and killed. In one note in 2002, the monitor also observed that members of a special hazardous-spills response unit had communications equipment and cars that were barely working. They did not have a boat. And despite its specialized training, the squad was often called to clean pigeon droppings off agency buildings whose roofs were in disrepair, the monitor said. While these lapses are troubling, federal officials said, the city's water has been found to be safe. In a separate investigation, federal prosecutors announced last month that they were looking into whether the city had misrepresented the lead levels in its drinking water. A spokeswoman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg would not comment on the monitor's reports. Shortly before he left office last week for a job in private business, the agency's commissioner, Christopher Ward, did not dispute the thrust of the findings, but said in a phone interview that many dated to the period after the 2001 guilty plea, and that since then, the department had made ''historic strides.'' It has ''transformed itself from within,'' Mr. Ward said, ''and now is an agency which works diligently on all aspects to ensure full compliance.'' In his recent reports, including one filed in September, the monitor, A. Patrick Nucciarone, credits the agency with making progress. The monitor's supervision of the agency was to have lasted three years, but the judge, Charles L. Brieant, has extended it for a fourth year, saying it ''seemed to be necessary and appropriate.'' David N. Kelley, the United States attorney in Manhattan, whose office sought the extension, said by phone: ''The lack of senior management oversight, and the need for greater accuracy in reporting on compliance, are among the recurring themes of the monitor's reports. We'll stay the course through the probationary period until the goals of full compliance are met.'' Charges against a government agency are highly unusual. In pleading guilty, the agency admitted that from 1998 to 2000, it knowingly discharged mercury-contaminated water into a pool that flowed into the Rondout Reservoir in Sullivan County. It also admitted that in Westchester County, it had used machinery contaminated with PCB's to control the flow of water without protecting employees who came into contact with the equipment. As part of its sentence, the agency was fined $50,000. The department, which has 6,000 employees, operates a huge network of aqueducts, reservoirs, tunnels and pipes to supply more than one billion gallons of water to New York City each day. Paul Shechtman, a lawyer representing the department, said its employees had for years been single-minded about their mission: ''to make sure each morning that water showed up at your tap.'' ''It was clean,'' Mr. Shechtman said. ''It tasted good. People would say, 'It's the best water in the United States.' And they took enormous pride in it.'' But prosecutors said there had been a deeply ingrained belief among at least some managers in the department that their task was only to deliver the water -- and that given the enormous quantities of water flowing through the system, any chemicals that might be discharged would have no measurable effect. The view was, ''Dilution is the solution to pollution,'' prosecutors wrote. As Mr. Nucciarone summarized the problem in his first report to the court, ''The federal investigation found a management in need of education, and a culture in need of change.'' But a look at three years of monitor's reports provides a glimpse at how hard it was for the agency to change that culture as it tried to clean up its act. For example, Mr. Nucciarone cited the case of a veteran manager, Thomas Hook, who, according to the agency, supervised more than 370 employees and was responsible for all operations and engineering work in the city's upstate water supply system. Mr. Hook had a long record of questionable conduct, Mr. Nucciarone contended, citing incidents in which he was accused of castigating employees for trying to report spills or refusing a request to buy protective gear for workers assigned to enter contaminated buildings. Yet the agency had not suspended or disciplined Mr. Hook, Mr. Nucciarone noted. Instead, Mr. Hook was reassigned to a nonsupervisory position in design and construction, with no formal announcement to the agency's employees about why the transfer was made. Writing to Mr. Nucciarone to explain the decision, Commissioner Ward cited Mr. Hook's more than 30 years of service, and said it would be inappropriate and unfair to make a public announcement that the transfer was punitive. Mr. Nucciarone disagreed. ''Immunity from punishment because of senior status is the precise source of the culture deficiency'' that had to be purged, he wrote to the judge. Mr. Kelley, the United States attorney, also wrote to Judge Brieant, citing the monitor's findings and adding that his office's own investigation had found that for years, Mr. Hook had helped perpetuate ''a climate of fear, intimidation and neglect'' that encouraged the covering up of violations. Mr. Kelley said that suspension and loss of pay were routine penalties for rank-and-file employees, even for such infractions as failure to wear hard hats. By not informing its employees that Mr. Hook had been punished for his actions, Mr. Kelley asserted, the department was sending ''a powerful message'' that its discipline was ''at best, selective.'' In a telephone interview, Commissioner Ward said Mr. Hook's reassignment had been understood agency-wide and ''set a tone and practice for the agency in terms of the importance and seriousness of this issue.'' He acknowledged that Mr. Hook had failed in terms of legal and regulatory obligations and said the department had ''responded accordingly.'' But, he said, ''Tom Hook was and is a committed D.E.P. employee,'' adding that he ''remains a valuable asset to the department.'' Mr. Hook declined to comment, other than to say, ''The bottom line is, it's ruined a career.'' In his reports, Mr. Nucciarone also contended that the agency had failed to quickly address workplace conditions in the Jerome Park Reservoir in the Bronx, where an employee was killed in 2001. The worker, Archie Tyler, lost his footing in several feet of water and was sucked into a 20-inch-wide drain he was trying to unclog. Although the need for a safety platform was quickly identified, Mr. Nucciarone wrote, construction was not expected to begin until late 2004. An agency spokesman said the unclogging procedure would not be performed again until the platform was in place. Delays in compliance were not unusual, Mr. Nucciarone reported. In May 2002, for example, he noted that the agency had just followed up on a 1999 request to 21 upstate water districts to remove and replace flow meters that contained mercury. Mr. Nucciarone said he was disconcerted to learn that the 1999 request had resulted from a memo -- written 13 years earlier -- that cited the meters as ''potential health risks'' for workers. Under the terms of its probation, the agency was to develop a system to prevent and detect violations, but it moved so slowly that in February 2003, James B. Comey, then the United States attorney, asked Judge Brieant to order that the monitor come up with a compliance schedule and that daily fines be imposed if the department did not adhere to it. The department agreed to a timetable. In some reports, however, Mr. Nucciarone described the Herculean efforts it took to determine compliance. ''Dozens of telephone calls and memos are necessary,'' he wrote earlier this year, ''just to learn whether required eye wash stations have been delivered to and installed within distant facilities.'' In his September 2004 report, Mr. Nucciarone wrote that unannounced visits to four buildings had turned up the fact that 30 of 88 problems had been inaccurately reported as fixed. He reminded the department that accurate reporting was one of the ''cornerstones of an effectively administered compliance program.'' In his May 2002 report, Mr. Nucciarone reported poor conditions for the hazardous materials team. The team was responsible for responding to spills in the nearly 2,000-square-mile watershed north of the city. Four of its members, assigned to the area east of the Hudson River, shared a windowless office with manageable space for one person, the monitor wrote. Because the office was in a thick-walled stone building behind a large hill, its radio communication system was ineffective, Mr. Nucciarone wrote. ''Perhaps worse,'' he added, ''the four share two old, poorly maintained vehicles for use in responding to emergency calls.'' On top of that, he wrote, ''they do not have a boat.'' At least twice, he said, team members were called to a spill, but were not allowed to use agency cars. On another occasion, he said, they were not allowed to use a boat to assist with spill control. But there was one thing they did regularly accomplish, he added: ''Despite their training, the Hazmat team is often called to clean pigeon feces from buildings with roofs in disrepair.'' In an update several months later, Mr. Nucciarone said the team had obtained more trucks and other response vehicles, along with an effective mobile-communications system. But he said he was not aware of changes in the team's working conditions or in its duties cleaning pigeon droppings. Mr. Ward, the commissioner, said the department had ''diligently upgraded its Hazmat capability throughout the watershed, and today is well on its way to a state-of-the-art response team.''"
"New York City violated federal drinking water rules over the past six years by supplying incomplete results from its annual tests for lead, state health officials said yesterday. The complete results now show that the city's tap water had slightly more than the allowable levels of lead from 2000 through 2002, the Health Department officials said, but they stressed that there was no significant threat to public health. The state did not issue any fines for the reporting violation. State health officials said they would require the city's Department of Environmental Protection to provide a plan by the end of this year for replacing all service lines and pipes where lead is found to be leaking into drinking water and to increase the frequency of lead testing to every six months from once a year. They will also require the city to begin a program to inform citizens how to determine how much lead is in their tap water. ''For precautionary reasons we are requiring New York City to immediately begin taking a series of corrective actions to further ensure its drinking water is of good quality and safe for residents to consume,'' said Robert Kenny, a spokesman for the Health Department. ''We will continue to closely monitor this situation with the federal government.'' With about 6,000 employees, the City Department of Environmental Protection oversees the aqueducts, reservoirs, tunnels and pipes that supply more than one billion gallons of water to the city each day. It is also in charge of administering annual lead tests on drinking water. The state's Health Department is supposed to collect the final data and ensure that the city remains in compliance with federal regulations. Charles G. Sturcken, a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection, said the city was still reviewing the state's requirements but he added that lead levels in city drinking water were within allowable range in 2003. In a sign of the confusion that exists over federal rules governing the testing of tap water, Mr. Sturcken said the federal environmental authorities issued a clarification of the rules within the past week. ''We are going to take a close look at the order issued by the state,'' Mr. Sturcken said, ''but we're also going to look closely at the clarification of the rules issued by the federal government, and I imagine most every water provider in the country will be doing the same.'' The Health Department began investigating the city's lead testing last month after news reports that providers of drinking water around the nation were not properly reporting the results of their tests. ''We think the state's action is entirely appropriate,'' said Mary Mears, a spokeswoman for the federal Environmental Protection Agency for the New York region. She praised the state for taking action so quickly. Eric A. Goldstein, a lawyer who monitors drinking water issues at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, and who has reviewed the data from the city's lead tests for the past four years, said lead levels in the city's drinking water have steadily declined since the early 1990's. The tests also reveal that in a small percentage of households, dangerous levels of lead are leaching into the water from household pipes or service lines, he said. ''We see no evidence that the Department of Environmental Protection's violation was intentional,'' Mr. Goldstein said of the city agency. ''But it is still a smudge on the agency's reputation, and it shows that the agency has a ways to go before it meets its responsibilities to protect the city's water.'' The department has been under federal supervision by a court-appointed monitor since 2001. The monitor was imposed after the department pleaded guilty to violating federal environmental laws by discharging mercury-contaminated water into a pool that flowed into an upstate reservoir and by leaving employees unprotected for more than a decade as they used machinery contaminated with PCB's. Over the past several years, the monitor has filed reports revealing that the department has been plagued by an entrenched political culture that has led to infighting, mishaps and oversights. On Nov. 18, the monitor told the federal judge handling the case that department officials had repeatedly tried to impede investigations of possible violations of federal health, safety and environmental laws. Federal oversight of the agency, which was supposed to last three years, was recently extended for a fourth year, until Aug. 29, 2005. On Thursday, Councilman James F. Gennaro, chairman of the Committee on Environmental Protection, will hold a hearing to review the department's handling of health and safety matters."
"Most of the New Yorkers who have opposed the city's plans to redevelop the West Side and build a football stadium there actually live or work on the West Side, and dislike the proposed changes to the neighborhood. But State Assemblyman Adriano Espaillat and several other Harlem residents have a different reason for their opposition -- one that is more than four miles to the north. Mr. Espaillat is concerned about the proposal's effect on the sprawling North River Wastewater Treatment Plant, on the Hudson River from 137th Street to 145th Street. He and Peggy Shepard, co-founder of West Harlem Environmental Action, held a news conference on Friday to say that the city's ambitious plan to redevelop the West Side at the 34th Street rail yards could overwhelm the plant, causing untreated sewage to overflow into the river. They seized on information contained in the city's own environmental impact statement, or E.I.S., for the project. Deep in its 4,300 pages the statement says that the sewage flow from the West Side to the treatment plant would climb to 8.6 million gallons a day by the time of the project's expected completion in 2025, from 1.1 million gallons now. Most of the increase would come from the 12,000 apartments and 28 million square feet of office space the city envisions for the area, which would include new skyscrapers, parks, an expanded convention center, and the 75,000-seat stadium for the Jets. And sewage is only one issue to emerge from the seven-volume environmental report, which elected officials, community groups, urban planners and stadium opponents are now digging through to unearth previously undisclosed details. The statement describes a dramatic change for the better for this drab former industrial area. But critics say it also contains significant warnings about traffic, transit, parking, air pollution, ground pollution and neighborhood schools, many of which are likely to become flashpoints during the seven-month approval process. Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, the city's point man on the project, said that relatively few problems have emerged from one of the city's most exhaustive environmental reviews. And most of these show up, he said, under worst-case scenarios after the redevelopment is completed. ''This plan is essential to securing New York's economic future,'' he said. ''Over time, 125,000 people will have jobs in this area and will generate more than $60 billion in new tax revenues. Existing conditions will change. But as the E.I.S. demonstrates, relative to the enormous benefits it will produce, the problems are very, very manageable.'' Other city officials agree. ''I don't think there's any place in the United States where you could do a development of this magnitude with as few environmental issues as we're facing,'' said Sandy Hornick, deputy executive director at the city's Planning Department. Nonetheless, the city's own environmental statement raises several issues. During peak periods after the development is finished, 10 key intersections on the West Side of Manhattan will endure tie-ups of five minutes or more, the report says. The Queens-Midtown Tunnel would operate at more than 90 percent of capacity on game days. At midday, virtually every off-street parking space on the West Side would be taken, according to the report. There would also be long lines on some stairways, platforms and token booths in Herald Square, Times Square and at Grand Central Terminal, according to the report. Some problems could be fixed by installing high-speed escalators or widening stairwells, but at other stations, the report indicates that the problems cannot be solved. ''It's unusual for an E.I.S. to indicate that even with mitigation measures, there are still going to be some very significant problems,'' said Eric Goldstein, a staff lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council. Mr. Goldstein opposes the plan. Mr. Hornick said that the city was exploring other measures to ease the problems. In most areas of the West Side, the report said, street noise during an average day will be so loud that the city will require special insulation in new buildings, and it will offer to install double windows, although there were no cost estimates in the report. To prevent new buildings from adding to already serious air pollution on the West Side, the city will require new developers to use natural gas instead of fuel oil for heating and to move their smokestacks away from the edges of the towers. The report states that the city will give 99 properties ''E'' designations, indicating that there are potential environmental contamination problems, a familiar condition in industrial neighborhoods. The city has yet to conduct soil samples at the 13.5-acre rail yard west of 11th Avenue, between 30th and 34th Streets, where the Jets hope to build a $1.4 billion stadium that would double as an adjunct to the nearby convention center. Many environmentalists expect severe contamination problems, given that the site has been a rail yard for 150 years. The report acknowledges that there will be a need for new schools for incoming residents, but there is no indication of where they would be or what they would cost. Finally, the report anticipates that the West Side will require an additional 309 megawatts of electricity. Mr. Hornick said that Con Edison would need to build two electrical substations and one transmission station, although it is unclear where they would be or how much they would cost. ''A plan of this magnitude needs to take into account all the potential infrastructure needs of a project and the neighborhood,'' said Councilwoman Christine Quinn, who represents the West Side. ''Come 2025 we can't come back and say, 'Oh, we need to put in new sewers.' Some might say we're being overly critical, but given the massive amount of development, the E.I.S. needs to be more specific than anything we've ever seen.'' Mr. Espaillat said the redevelopment would overburden the sewage treatment plant in his neighborhood, predicting that overflows would be dumped into the Hudson River. ''This is exactly the type of weather that would increase the backup into sewage lines at the North River plant and result in untreated sewage being pumped into the Hudson,'' he said on Friday, gesturing at the rainstorm. ''It just doesn't have the capacity.'' But city officials say the North River plant is currently operating at 132 million gallons a day, or 40 million gallons below its dry-weather capacity. There is more than enough room for the West Side expansion, they say. The environmental report concedes that there would be an increase of untreated sewage flowing into the Hudson during rainstorms. But it states that the overflow would not ''result in a significant adverse impact to water quality.''"
"New York City seems a fine place for an observant Jew to keep kosher. There are specialty shops for the ultra-Orthodox and for those of less strict beliefs. And it all works out just fine, provided you don't get thirsty. Some rabbis now say that New York City tap water -- for a century a gold standard for cleanliness -- is not kosher. These rabbis have recently discovered that there are tiny creatures, called copepods, in the unfiltered water that streams into the city from upstate. These tiny organisms are harmless. But they are crustaceans. And crustaceans are not considered kosher. Over the past two weeks, concern about the copepods in the water has grown into a matter of intense debate among the city's Orthodox Jews. Disputes over interpretations of Talmudic law, part sport, part obsession and part spiritual imperative, spill into public view periodically in New York. Last month, for example, members of the Satmar community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, took wigs made of human hair from India and burned them in the street. The wigs were deemed unacceptable because they might have been used in Hindu ceremonies considered idolatrous in Orthodox teaching. The concern about the water, though, ''really spans the entire spectrum,'' said Harold Skovronsky, an Orthodox Jew who lives in Midwood, a Brooklyn neighborhood where many people wear yarmulkes with business attire. ''They're not scared,'' he said, ''it's purely a religious issue.'' Signs of concern abound in neighborhoods like Midwood. At Alexander's Hardware & Locksmith, a worker named Gregory Likhtin has taken the water filters from the shelves and set them up near the cash register. A few blocks away, officials at Yeshiva Toras Emes Kamenitz elementary school have spent hundreds of dollars installing plumbing gear behind the walls to filter the drinking water. Midwood is home to Rabbi Feivel Cohen, a ranking religious leader who has taken a stand against drinking unfiltered tap water, according to people who have heard him speak. Rabbi Cohen declared through a closed door yesterday that he was ''not giving interviews.'' The dispute over the water is multifaceted and opaque. It goes all the way back to the dispute over the vegetables. Alei Katif, a company based in Rehovot, Israel, that sells vegetables rabbinically certified as bug-free to those who believe that ingesting insects is counter to Talmudic law, was accused by some Jews in New York of selling contaminated vegetables, said Yair Hoffman, an Orthodox Jew who lives in Far Rockaway, Queens. Alei Katif officials suggested instead that the vegetables became infested upon being rinsed in New York, Mr. Hoffman said. Two weeks ago, Mr. Hoffman and others tested the company's assertion by inspecting city tap water under a microscope. They saw copepods, millimeter-long zooplankton that are common in the ocean and in groundwater. ''And they're ugly,'' Mr. Hoffman said. Ugly though they may be, city officials and independent scientists agree that they are harmless. ''There's absolutely no health risk,'' said Charles G. Sturcken, a spokesman for the city Department of Environmental Protection. Jonathan Cohen, a Duke University student who is writing a doctoral dissertation on copepod migration, said that some look like armadillos, some like bowling pins and other like rolling suitcases. ''It would be like swallowing a couple of gnats if you were outdoors on a summer evening,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''But it's not like you're ingesting thousands of them.'' The city's surface water supply provides 1.2 billions gallons of water daily to eight million people, and its cleanliness has won its overseers permission from federal authorities to skip filtering altogether, relying instead on chemical processes. But the cleanliness of the water only provides fodder for the debate. What defines an insect? Does seeing one through a microscope constitute seeing one for the purposes of kosher law? And, perhaps most confoundedly, can a person legitimately claim not to see a copepod with the naked eye after looking through a microscope and learning what one looks like? Reactions from the faithful have been varied. Saul Kessler, who sells wholesale water filters and installs full-home filtration systems in Queens, said he has gotten 100 phone calls from homeowners. Laser Shum, of Midwood, is still drinking tap water.''If you take a microscope, you'll see a lot of things you don't want to see,'' Mr. Shum said. For Bahar Tuht, 23, an employee of Alexander's hardware store who is not Jewish, the rush on filters has been a learning experience. He has sold about 40 in the last two weeks, compared with about two in a normal two-week period, but his customers have become more selective about the kinds of filters they will buy, following subsequent declarations from their rabbis. ''Some of the filters have a light indicator; the light goes on, it's no good for Shabbos,'' Mr. Tuht said. ''I work here, I sell stuff. You learn.''"
"Only 30 years ago, the Hudson River was little more than a 350-mile-long sewer stretching from the Adirondacks to the Battery in Manhattan, choked with untreated municipal waste and industrial chemicals. Today, thanks to state and federal clean water laws and citizen vigilance, the river pulses with life. The fish are more numerous than they have been in years, boating is booming, and towns that once turned their backs on the river teem with tourists. But the Hudson is not home free, which makes the new Hudson River Congressional Caucus a welcome addition to the ranks of the river's advocates. The caucus was formed by three House members from Westchester County -- Nita Lowey, a Democrat, and John Sweeney and Sue Kelly, both Republicans -- and includes eight others. Its first objective is to find money to build the rivers and estuaries center in Beacon, an educational and research facility proposed by Gov. George Pataki four years ago. Its longer-range mission is to round up support for open space preservation, waterfront restoration and economic development. These are laudable goals. But they are not necessarily compatible goals. Careless management of commercial and residential pressures, for example, will inevitably undermine the river's ecological integrity as well as the landscapes and unhurried way of life that appeal to residents and tourists alike. A case in point is the unresolved struggle over a company's plans to build an enormous new cement plant on the east bank of the river just south of Hudson, N.Y. The plant is billed as economic development, but it would be an eyesore in a region increasingly dependent on cultural tourism. Caucus members say they hope to steer clear of such conflicts, but they are fooling themselves if they think they can avoid hard choices. To take another example, they want no part of the lingering controversies surrounding the Environmental Protection Agency's decision in 2001 requiring General Electric to clean up the PCB's the company dumped into the river years ago. The caucus says this is already a done deal. True, but the actual cleanup will not begin until 2006. The caucus can exercise an important oversight function by making sure there is no backsliding. It can hardly call itself a true friend of the river otherwise. Westchester"
"Disaster relief officials warned on Tuesday that stressful housing conditions, intense summer heat and diseases from contaminated food and water could cause the problems from Hurricane Charley to increase in coming days. Until electricity is restored, thousands of residents could be subject to heat stroke in the muggy 90-degree weather, poisoning from eating spoiled food and diseases caused by sewage-contaminated water, the officials said. As of Tuesday evening, more than 490,000 people were still without power. Touring parts of the storm-ravaged western Florida coast, Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, said there were ''so many health areas'' that posed a risk in the aftermath of the storm. ''The president has demanded that every federal department to whatever they possibly can to aid the recovery effort,'' Mr. Thompson, wearing muddy sneakers, said in Fort Myers. ''Every request will be fulfilled to satisfy all of Florida's needs.'' But five days after the powerful Category 4 storm ripped a path across the state, federal and local officials were sending a message that residents should prepare for a frustratingly slow reconstruction process that could take months to complete. ''People are pushing as hard as they can'' to rebuild and get services going again, said Tom Ridge, the secretary of homeland security, who toured the coast with Mr. Thompson. Mr. Ridge predicted that the ''disappointment and sorrow'' caused by the storm damage would soon turn into frustration as reconstruction dragged on. On Tuesday, officials said the death toll from the storm had risen by one to 20, after an 86-year-old man who had evacuated his home fell and died in a motel. Government and private relief officials said they were concerned about the psychological strain on thousands of people who had fled storm-damaged homes to stay with friends and relatives in crowded shelters or cramped motel rooms. Though many of them are getting along fine now, many are also likely to find those living conditions unbearable within days, officials said. Experts said domestic violence, substance abuse and even suicide could result from the stress of being displaced. For that reason, the Red Cross has mobilized hundreds of mental health experts to begin door-to-door visits with displaced people, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency is preparing to locate long-term temporary housing for storm victims. ''There is this honeymoon phase of a disaster response when people are pulling together and helping each other,'' said Peter R. Teahen, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Florida. ''But if they are staying in other people's homes, after a week or 10 days those people want their house back and everyone is getting on each others' nerves. Then you see the stress level and anxiety levels go up.'' Beverly Gill, 42, is among the many doubling up with a relative. Her home in Punta Gorda, one of the most severely damaged towns, has no power or water, and the howling winds blew out most of her windows. So she moved two of her three children into her father's nearby home, leaving her 15-year-old son behind to guard her house against looters. Ms. Gill, a school teacher, said she was getting along fine in her father's house. But when asked how long she expected to stay there, she cast a wary glance at her father and replied in a whisper, ''I don't know.'' At a shelter in Englewood, west of Punta Gorda, Crystal Hanisch, 25, said she, her husband and their two small children stayed briefly with her husband's parents after the hurricane blew the roof off her apartment unit and caused part of the living room roof to collapse. But her mother-in-law was preoccupied caring for her severely ill husband, and the house seemed too cramped for the family's 5-year-old son and 10-month-old daughter. So they decamped to a Red Cross shelter in a middle school, where they now live on cots and share bathrooms with dozens of other refugees. ''I'm tired, so tired,'' Ms. Hanisch said as she cradled her infant daughter on a cafeteria bench. ''I just miss being able to shower when I want to shower.'' But Ms. Hanisch said she had no clear options for short-term housing. She has been told that the waiting list for public housing is prohibitively long, and she has been unable to reach federal disaster relief officials on the telephone. She would consider moving her family to her stepfather's home in Georgia, but has been unable to reach him. ''I have no idea what we'll do,'' Ms. Hanisch said. Many others are making do under hardscrabble conditions in their heavily damaged homes, refusing to leave either out of fear of looters or because they have nowhere to go. Others have resorted to living in tents or cars. Evelyn Loehnert, 85, and her husband, Arthur, 92, have stayed in their Punta Gorda house even though the storm demolished several rooms and tore off part of the roof. They have put wood planks over holes in the floor and have been sleeping on a couch and reclining chair in their living room, which still has a ceiling. They considered moving into a hotel, but could not find one with rooms available. Local officials said they expected shelter populations to rise as more people like the Loehnerts feel the need to give up on their damaged homes or leave friends' houses after long stays. ''Those that are staying short term with loved ones may decide they don't want to be a burden,'' said Matt Holloman, the public information coordinator for DeSoto County. ''Pride may drive them to go to a shelter rather than stay with someone for a week at a time.'' State officials said there were 1,992 people in shelters on Tuesday. But the number of displaced people is in the thousands, and probably tens of thousands, they said. For instance, a damage assessment by federal and Red Cross officials based on satellite images and on-the-ground inspections concluded that nearly 6,000 homes were destroyed and more than 10,000 pthers severely damaged. Red Cross officials said those numbers would rise significantly because the assessment covered only two-thirds of the affected region. Officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Washington said that 32,242 people had applied for federal housing assistance, which could include money for hotels, repairs or rent. They have also estimated that the state will need at least 10,000 preassembled homes to replace destroyed homes. FEMA has also established a drive-through service station in Punta Gorda, where a representative greets each driver and members of the Florida National Guard load canned food, water, tarpaulins for damaged roofs and other supplies into cars. Matt Holloman, the public information coordinator for DeSoto County, said that at least 2,600 homes in the largely rural county suffered major damage, and another 2,000 sustained minor damage. ''So right there we are pushing 5,000 homes,'' Mr. Holloman said, ''and if our two shelters are only packing 100 folks a night on average, those people are obviously going somewhere else.'' DeSoto County, which covers 660 square miles, has many multigenerational families, he said, so many storm victims can stay with relatives close by. That contrasts with Charlotte County and some of the other coastal counties, where many of those affected were retirees whose relatives live in other parts of the country. HURRICANE CHARLEY: THE OVERVIEW"
"I.B.M. has agreed to a consent order with the state that binds the company, founded in this upstate village, to a course of action to clean up an underground plume of industrial pollution, decades old, that has sent chemical vapors wafting into hundreds of basements. The company, which was not the sole source of the pollution but is the only business working on the cleanup, has already spent several million dollars installing ventilation systems similar to those used for radon gas, and creating a network of wells, pumps and filters to extract chemical contaminants from groundwater. The vapor problem came to light here in 2003 as a result of air-quality tests sought by residents and required by the State Department of Environmental Conservation. I.B.M. agreed to the consent order on Aug. 4 without admitting wrongdoing. ''We are fully committed to this project,'' said Todd Martin, a spokesman for I.B.M., which has reduced its work force here to 1,700 from a peak of 12,000 in the mid-1970's through the 80's. The order states that the company disagrees with the department's assessment that the pollution poses ''a significant threat to public health and the environment.'' I.B.M. is installing a piping system that will transport water from extraction wells to a treatment facility on Monroe Street, Mr. Martin said. Earlier this year, the company donated $2 million to the village for equipment to help treat its well water. The 52-page consent order outlines specific steps I.B.M. must take in the next year. The company is required to file plans for additional work, with deadlines ranging from 45 days to a year. The requirements include devising a blueprint for identifying and eliminating underground pollution at what was a sprawling circuit-board factory on North Street. Penalties and fines for failure to complete work on time range from $500 to $3,000 a day. The order also requires ''additional investigation and remediation,'' said Commissioner Erin M. Crotty of the Department of Environmental Conservation. The order also calls for interim steps to be taken. They include more aggressive pumping and treatment at areas of known contamination and the use of vacuum-assisted pumping for trapping vapors as well as contaminants in groundwater. The order also allows the state agency to step in and require immediate action if new and pressing problems are uncovered. The plume is responsible for so-called vapor intrusion from contaminated soil beneath 480 properties, most of them homes and businesses, between the Susquehanna River and the former I.B.M. campus. People who live there have wondered whether the pollution has played a role in assorted cancers and other illnesses over the years. The pollution resulted from a series of spills, some of which have been traced to the I.B.M. site. Alan Turnbull, the executive director of the Resident Action Group of Endicott, which has tracked the pollution and argued for state intervention, welcomed the agreement. ''This has been a long time coming, but thankfully it has arrived,'' said Mr. Turnbull, who helped organize the group after his wife, Donna, was found to have throat cancer. Since 1980, I.B.M. has pumped out 78,000 gallons of chemicals. The village is now dotted with 342 wells, paid for by I.B.M., that monitor or extract groundwater. Betty Havel's husband, Joseph, used to operate his taxidermy business in the basement of their home on Arthur Avenue. But now the basement is largely unused -- one of several hundred in the village center that are being vented to remove trace amounts of potentially harmful vapors seeping into homes from contaminated soil. The ground contaminants are a byproduct of chemicals called volatile organic compounds that were used as degreasers by local industries, including I.B.M. Before the state became involved, said Edward Blaine, whose home is being vented, ''it seemed like I.B.M. was setting the timetable, the D.E.C. was monitoring it, but they weren't setting deadlines. Now that's changed.'' Mr. Blaine said subsequent tests of air quality in his home have shown a decrease in the contaminants, including trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene. The chemicals have been associated with health risks ranging from organ damage to cancer in people exposed to enough of them. ''All of us wish this had never happened to begin with,'' said Mayor Joan Pulse. ''But the state has said to I.B.M. that you must do this. And I.B.M. is stepping up and saying, 'We will do it.''' Many residents have been unable to sell their homes at prices they considered fair market value, Mrs. Havel said. ''Some days I wake up and say, I want to get away from it all, just pack up the car and go.'' Nonetheless, residents said the consent order represents a victory. ''This is a testimony to the collective action on the part of local residents,'' said Donna Lupardo, a member of Resident Action Group of Endicott."
"Perhaps you recall the line from ''Dr. Strangelove,'' Stanley Kubrick's film -- now 40 years old -- about nuclear war and fluoridation. ''As human beings,'' Gen. Jack D. Ripper says to Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake, ''you and I need fresh pure water to replenish our precious bodily fluids.'' Hard to imagine what General Ripper would have thought of the recent announcement by Britain's Environment Agency that it had found traces of the antidepressant drug Prozac in rivers and groundwater. The idea of someone dumping mood-altering pharmaceuticals into the water supply sounds suitably Strangelovian. But the source in this case is humans, whose consumption of antidepressants has risen at an alarming rate -- to 24 million prescriptions in Britain in 2001 from some 9 million in 1991. The actual level of contamination was not announced. It's likely to be very low, but there is not much reassurance in that. In fact, there's something genuinely depressing about finding a nation's water supply to be contaminated by antidepressants. Britain is hardly alone in finding weird stuff coming out of the tap. Surveys of some American water supplies have turned up traces of everything from hormones to antibiotics. It makes you wonder what other drugs are lurking in the water and in what proportions. If Prozac is present, can Viagra be far behind?"
"With about six weeks left in the federal government's fiscal year, dozens of Superfund sites that are eligible for cleanup money are likely to be granted nothing or a fraction of what their managers say is needed because of a budget shortfall that could exceed $250 million, according to a survey by the Democratic staff of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The list of sites was compiled from information provided privately by officials at the Environmental Protection Agency, according to a letter sent on Friday to Michael O. Leavitt, the agency's administrator, from Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the committee. The letter and an attached list indicate that at sites like Atlas Tack, a company that made tacks and nails in Fairhaven, Mass., Omaha Lead in Omaha and Woolfolk Chemical Works, in Fort Valley, Ga., cleanup managers are likely to fall behind in clearing toxic residue like lead particles, cyanide and arsenic in soil or groundwater. The original cleanup fund, built on industry taxes, has dwindled to negligible levels in the nine years since Congress abolished those taxes, so the money is now almost entirely drawn from general tax revenue. A subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee recently recommended rejecting the E.P.A.'s request for an additional $150 million for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. Money for cleanup can be allocated at any time in the fiscal year. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2003, according to an inspector general's report, the shortfall amounted to about $175 million. ''The trend is clear and is being ignored at the expense of public health and the environment,'' Mr. Dingell said in his letter to Mr. Leavitt. Thomas P. Dunne, the acting assistant administrator of the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response at the E.P.A., said that the final allocations ''have to wait till the end'' of the fiscal year because in the next few weeks, unspent money from other projects can be harvested to fill some of the gap. He added that he did not expect the shortfall to continue growing indefinitely. ''There are two questions,'' he said. ''One, does Superfund have enough money to start all the sites that have come on line?'' Indicating that the answer was no, he said, ''obviously it is not a good thing to have that backlog remain in place for a long time.'' The second question, he said, was what was the risk to the public. ''In the short term it doesn't present any risk,'' he said. ''We're waiting for appropriations, and we've found that some sites that may be potentially serious aren't ready'' for cleanup, Mr. Dunne said. The underlying issue, he said, is that more than half of the available cleanup money is being spent on nine huge sites, including the Bunker Hill Mining and Metallurgical Complex in Smelterville, Idaho; New Bedford Harbor in Massachusetts, which is contaminated by toxic chemicals once discharged by factories in the area; and three sites in New Jersey -- the Chemical Insecticide site in Edison Township, the Federal Creosote site in Manville and the Vineland Chemical site in Vineland. Katherine N. Probst, author of ''Superfund's Future,'' a 2001 report to Congress that predicted a growing shortfall of money, said that people who live near the affected sites will feel the financing squeeze. ''These people have been promised something they are not getting,'' she said. Delaying the cleanup of a problem like groundwater pollution, she said, means ''it probably will cost us more in the long run.'' The shortage of cleanup money has existed for two years, a period during which Superfund's budget has remained flat at about $1.3 billion. Cleanup money is divided into three pots -- one for emergency actions to safeguard human health, one for assessments of longer-term problems, and the third for ''remedial action'' or cleanup of pollution. The E.P.A.'s money problems occur as the House Appropriations Committee is making its final decisions on the agency's budget for the next fiscal year. The E.P.A.'s Superfund Web site said that as of Friday, there were 1,242 sites on the national priority list of sites approved for cleanup. The most recent recommendations of a priority-setting panel within the E.P.A. leave more than two dozen sites that had been scheduled to receive planning or cleanup money without any money at all, Mr. Dingell's letter said. A dozen more are scheduled to get less than the directors of E.P.A.'s regional offices had requested, the letter added. Around the Omaha Lead site -- which was allocated about 15 percent less than the $6 million its managers had requested, according to the Democratic staff report -- there are thousands of house yards where lead contamination is suspected to be two or three times greater than the level considered safe, according to the E.P.A.'s summary documents about the site; delaying financing is likely to mean delaying the sampling of yards and identification of hazards. Marion Pressure Treating, a site in northern Louisiana, is facing its second rejection for financing in the last two years. The assessment of the site in the E.P.A.'s database indicates that the volatile chemicals from the creosote used in wood treatment presents ''the potential for elevated health/ecological risk levels.'' Woolfolk Chemical Works, in Fort Valley, Ga., is an old pesticide and herbicide plant that was partially cleaned in two projects in the 1990's. Officials at the site held a public meeting a year ago to unveil a further cleanup plan costing $21 million, The Macon Telegraph reported. The figures reported by the House Democratic staff members indicate that the site will get $1.5 million, 25 percent of what its managers had requested for this fiscal year. Michael Cook, director of the Superfund office, said in an interview Sunday: ''It will be funded at the level they can use this fiscal year, which won't be much because we are so close to the year's end. Then it will be much higher next year.'' In the case of a site like Omaha Lead, he added: ''We do have a number of sites that involve yard cleanups where we are working through the yards on a priority basis, but there definitely is exposure at the sites we have not been able to get to. That's a matter of the time it takes to undertake the cleanup actions.''"
"First the fish began to disappear. Then villagers began developing strange rashes and bumps. Finally in January, Masna Stirman, aided by a $1.50 wet nurse, gave birth to a tiny, shriveled girl with small lumps and wrinkled skin. ''The nurse said: 'Ma'am, the baby has deformities,''' Mrs. Stirman, 39, recalled in an interview. Unable to get any meaningful medical help in this remote fishing village of about 300 people, she watched as her fourth child suffered for months and then died in July. The infant's death came after years of complaints by local fishermen about waste dumped in the ocean by the owner of a nearby gold mine, the Newmont Mining Corporation, the world's biggest gold producer, based in Denver. It also kicked up a political brawl pitting Indonesia's feisty environmental groups against the American mining giant, which has been trailed by allegations of pollution on four continents. The fight has aroused intense interest in mining circles and among environmental groups for the fresh concerns it raises about how rich multinational companies -- especially those that extract resources like coal, copper and gold as well as oil and natural gas -- conduct themselves in poor nations. For Newmont, the battle is only the latest round of troubles as the company, concerned by the more stringent rules for mining permits in the United States, seeks greater growth from operations overseas, where environmental groups and, increasingly, government officials charge that it employs practices not tolerated at home. No definitive cause has been found for the illnesses among the villagers. Company executives, Newmont said in a statement, were ''convinced that we are not polluting the waters of Buyat Bay or adversely affecting the health of the people in that area.'' But on Aug. 31, an Indonesian government panel announced that Newmont ''had illegally disposed'' of waste containing arsenic and mercury in the ocean near the mine site, and had failed to get the required permits from the Ministry of Environment since 1996. The environment minister, Nabiel Makarim, said the company might face criminal charges. The findings came a week after a local legal aid group filed a suit on behalf of three villagers, including the baby's mother, in a district court in South Jakarta, alleging that they and the baby had been made sick by the mine waste. They are seeking $543 million in damages. The company denied the charges and said in its statement that it ''operates in full compliance with Indonesian and U.S. environmental standards.'' Newmont has run into trouble before, even at home. But some of the gravest allegations of polluting mining practices have come from its operations in developing nations, from Indonesia to Peru to Turkey. Here, the fight with Newmont has fueled a growing popular impression that mining and energy companies hold a tight grip over Indonesia's weak regulatory system. Many blame the corruption, cronyism and unevolved legal structure inherited from General Suharto, the dictator whose rule ended in 1998 and who, for a price, eagerly opened the doors to foreign investors. When Newmont first came looking for gold in Indonesia in the 1980's, it dealt with the Suharto government. Since then, a handful of officials knowledgeable about the environment have said they wanted to stand up to Newmont and other companies, but lost the battles. In Newmont's case, correspondence shows that from 2000 to 2002 the Ministry of Environment challenged Newmont about the toxicity of the mine waste it was dumping at Buyat Bay. In a letter to Newmont in March 2002, a senior ministry official, Isa Karnisa Ardiputra, listed seven points of concern and asked for ''immediate action.'' In an interview at Newmont's Jakarta headquarters on Aug. 27, the president of Newmont in Indonesia, Richard B. Ness, and other company officials said they were not aware of the letter. Emil Salim, a minister of the environment during the Suharto era, who is overseeing the panel that found Newmont had acted illegally, reflected the anger of many Indonesians over the dumping of waste that was allowed to go on for years despite such challenges from parts of the government. ''We are weak in governance in mining,'' he said. Using the mine industry's word to describe the waste, Mr. Salim said he had told the company: ''I am not against you. But please don't put your tailings in our ocean.'' Some sense a potential turning point in the outrage stirred by the death of Mrs. Stirman's baby. The mother was told by a doctor, Sandra Rotty, an Indonesian who works at the Newmont financed health center at nearby Ratatok, that the child had a common skin disease. After examining the baby in April, Dr. Rotty wrote to a local environmental group, Kelola, that the baby's skin ''disorder'' was ''caused by malnutrition.'' ''Now, the baby's condition is already better,'' she added. When the child showed no improvement, however, the group asked a team of public health doctors to visit Buyat Bay. About 120 villagers were waiting to be examined in June in the ad hoc clinic set up in three local homes. Thirty of the villagers had tumor-like growths, said one of the doctors, Jane Pangemanan. ''I was shocked by what I saw,'' she said in an interview. Of the 60 people she examined, about 80 percent showed symptoms of poisoning by mercury and arsenic, she said. On a recent visit to the community, and judging from the villagers who came to the Jakarta courthouse for the opening of the case on Aug. 27, the health problems were evident at almost every turn. One of the babies had a cyst the size of a small pea on the end of her tongue. A mother had two lumps on her breasts the size of golf balls. One woman had a large lump down her left side that made her look half pregnant. A lawyer for Newmont, Palmer Situmorang, said the lumps and skin diseases that the villagers complained about were the result of ''poor sanitation and poor nutrition.'' ''They are liars because their orientation is to just get money,'' he said. But an environmental scientist, Evan Edinger, who is an assistant professor at the University of Newfoundland in Canada and who is working with the Indonesian environmental group Friends of the Earth, said he believed that arsenic in the mine waste was the main cause of the illnesses. In laboratory tests in Canada, he found that about 30 percent of the arsenic in the sediment from Buyat Bay was soluble in weak acid environments, like the digestive tracts of worms, he said in an interview. ''Our hypothesis is that if you have sediment-feeding organisms and bottom-dwelling fish eat them, then that could be the pathway to contamination from arsenic,'' Mr. Edinger said. Newmont's own laboratory results also show high levels of arsenic in the sediment. But the company contends that the arsenic remains inert and nonsoluble in the ocean. In a paper released to the news media, Newmont said that ''collectively, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that mining activity at Minahasa has resulted in arsenic contamination of Buyat Bay biological ecosystem.'' The national police chief in Indonesia, Gen. Da'i Bachtiar, released the police's own laboratory results in August that showed mercury contamination of the sea. The company disputed the results, saying the police did not measure dissolved mercury. But General Da'i's chief investigator in the case, Sulistiandriatmoko, retorted: ''We are not that stupid. We measured the dissolved mercury, not the total mercury. I think they are just trying to distort the case.'' The Newmont mine above Buyat Bay is on the northern tip of Sulawesi in Minahasa, a region where fishermen in handmade wooden boats have been trawling for hundreds of years. Where small vanilla, clove and coconut plantations once prospered, Newmont carved five pits into the brown earth. With its relatively low costs and high-grade gold that was easy to get at, it was a ''little model of a mine,'' said Ali Sahami, a geologist who works as one of Newmont's environmental advisers. At the height of production from 1998 to 2000, the mine was producing nearly 25 percent of the company's international output. Newmont finished mining in 2001 and has since been processing mined ore, work it was scheduled to complete on Aug. 31. Villagers say the fish off their beach were once so plentiful they would start a fire for grilling before setting off to catch the evening meal. But almost immediately after mining operations started, the fish stocks dropped dramatically. Rasit Rahman, a squat man with a thick tangle of black hair, who had a lump removed from the back of his neck recently, was one of the plaintiffs who appeared in court on Aug. 27. ''My catch dwindled so fast after the mine came, I could no longer afford to send my youngest son to school,'' he said. Before the mine company came to the area in 1996, he said, he could earn $30 a day, a substantial amount in a village without electricity and running water. ''We had to look for another place to catch fish,'' he said. ''It was so much harder, and we were getting so little.'' At issue is Newmont's use of a waste disposal method, effectively banned in the United States under the Clean Water Act, that is called submarine tailing disposal. It involves piping treated mine waste into the ocean. Newmont uses the method not only at the mine near Buyat Bay, but also at its far bigger copper and gold mine on the island of Sumbawa. The legal aid group, Agency for Health Law, which has brought the suit on behalf of the villagers, charges that the system polluted the warm equatorial waters around the village, where people depend almost exclusively on fish for food as well as for their livelihoods. In the interview at the company's headquarters, Mr. Ness, the Newmont president in Indonesia, defended the use of the waste system. He also made that case before an Indonesian parliamentary committee in August. He said it was more ''responsible'' to put the waste in the sea than store it on land that could be subject to earthquakes. Furthermore, he said, ''Tailings are nothing more than ground-up rock.'' Others disagree. Environmental groups vociferously oppose the sea disposal of waste. Some mining companies, like the Australian giant BHP Billiton, say they would not use such a method in current projects, even though it is cheaper than land-based waste storage. Robert E. Moran, a hydrogeologist who advises mining companies and environmental groups, said in a telephone interview from Colorado that ''clearly tailings are much more complex chemically than crushed rock -- or else they would not require detoxification treatment prior to disposal.'' The waste from the mine being released into the sea amounted to a potentially ''toxic soup,'' he said. Mr. Moran, who reviewed partial analyses from the plant made available by Newmont, said he was confident that the waste consisted of metal-like elements like arsenic and antimony and metals like mercury, cadmium, lead, copper and zinc. Those substances in the rock where the gold is found, he said, are treated with sodium cyanide, and the subsequent mixture is treated again with other chemicals in an attempt to reduce the concentration of cyanides. In all likelihood, Mr. Moran said, some amount of cyanide compounds and other organic chemicals remained in the waste that was released into the ocean less than a half mile off shore at a relatively shallow depth of about 82 meters. In tropical waters like those around Buyat Bay, the toxic compounds often became ''more mobile and more accessible to the food chain than in temperate waters,'' Mr. Moran said. Washington's political risk insurance agency, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, does not like the submarine tailing disposal system, either. In the late 1990's, the agency refused to give insurance to a mine operated by Rio Tinto in Papua New Guinea on the grounds that the mine's submarine tailing system would violate United States domestic regulations. Newmont will essentially leave the site near Buyat Bay early next year, although a small skeleton staff will be on hand for three years to complete reclamation and oversee some community development projects, Newmont officials said. To its critics, Newmont says its mine closure plan will leave a community better off than when the company arrived. The plan shows photographs of a new school and groups of happy children splashing in clean water. But the villagers at the beach say they are uninterested. They are no longer able to sell their fish in the local markets. In addition to the illnesses that many now suffer, their livelihoods are shattered, said Anwar Stirman, the brother of Mrs. Stirman. ''We can no longer make money from the fish,'' Mr. Stirman said. ''We're talking to the provincial officials about our future. The whole village is waiting to be moved to another location.'' In any event, Newmont contends that the sea at Buyat Bay is in fine shape. The company ran color advertisements saying so in 10 Indonesian newspapers at the end of August. ''We find the water is in excellent condition,'' said Robert Humberson, general manager for external relations. ''I dive there myself. It's fabulous.'' Correction: September 13, 2004, Monday An article on Wednesday about pollution accusations in Indonesia directed against the Newmont Mining Company, the world's biggest gold producer, misstated the affiliation of Evan Edinger, an environmental scientist who has analyzed mining waste in Buyat Bay. He is an assistant professor at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, in Canada; there is no University of Newfoundland."
"A virulent form of hepatitis that is especially lethal for pregnant women has broken out in two of Iraq's most troubled districts, Iraqi Health Ministry officials said in interviews here this week, and they warned that a collapse of water and sewage systems in the continuing violence in the country is probably at the root of the outbreak. The disease, called hepatitis E, is caused by a virus that is often spread by sewage-contaminated drinking water. The officials said they had equipment to test only a limited number of people showing symptoms, suggesting that only a fraction of the actual cases have been firmly diagnosed. In Sadr City, a Baghdad slum that for months has been convulsed by gun battles between a local militia and American troops, the officials said as many as 155 cases had turned up. The second outbreak is in Mahmudiya, a town 35 miles south of Baghdad that is known for its kidnappings and shootings as well as for its poverty, where there are an estimated 60 cases. At least nine pregnant women are believed to have been infected, and one has died. Five deaths have been reported over all. ''We are saying that the real number is greatly more than this, because the area is greatly underreported,'' said Dr. Atta-alla Mekhlif Al-Salmani, leader of the viral hepatitis section at Health Ministry's Center of Disease Control. The World Health Organization is rushing hepatitis E testing kits, water purification tablets, informational brochures and other materials to Iraq, said Dr. Naeema Al-Gasseer, the W.H.O. representative for Iraq, who is now based in Amman, Jordan. But viral hepatitis comes in many forms, and another ominous set of statistics suggests that the quality of water supplies around the country has deteriorated since the American-led war began last year, Dr. Salmani said. In 2003, 70 percent more cases of hepatitis of all types were reported across Iraq than in the year before, he said. During the first six months of 2004, as many cases were reported as in all of 2002. In yet another indication of the deteriorating safety of water and food in Iraq, the number of reported cases of typhoid fever is up sharply this year, said Dr. Nima S. Abid, the ministry's director general of public health and primary health. Hospitals across the country are also full of children with severe forms of diarrhea, Dr. Abid said. Those reports come as the Bush administration has proposed shifting $3.46 billion in reconstruction money for Iraq to programs that would train and equip tens of thousands of additional police officers, border guards and national guardsmen in hopes of regaining control of the security situation. The shift, which needs approval by Congress, would gut what had been an ambitious program to rebuild Iraq's crumbling water and sewage systems, forcing the cancellation or delay of most of the projects. Last fall, Congress approved $18.4 billion for Iraq's reconstruction; so far, only about $1 billion has been spent. ''The problem is the whole infrastructure,'' Dr. Abid said of the mounting health problems, adding that many of the difficulties stemmed from neglect that began long before the invasion. But he said, ''Definitely no major intervention has been done in this last one and a half years to repair the problem.'' Viral hepatitis comes in numerous forms and with a variety of consequences, from benign to fatal. The most common type, hepatitis A, can be spread from person to person or through contaminated water. Like all forms of the disease, it infects liver cells and can cause jaundice and other symptoms, but there is often no permanent damage after recovery, said Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. Though it is also spread through water, hepatitis E, for reasons that are not well understood, is most dangerous for pregnant women, who can lose their unborn children and die, Dr. Schaffner said. He said the disease was found mainly in Central America, India and the Middle East. There is no vaccine to prevent the disease or standard drug regimen to treat it. The immediate reason for the outbreaks in Sadr City and Mahmudiya appear easy to pin down, Dr. Abid said. The lack of infrastructure induces families to tap into water mains with improvised hoses, he said, citing his own visits to the communities. Small electric pumps are then used to suck water into homes. But in these same communities, sewage either seeps from damaged pipes into the ground or runs freely in the streets, then through cracks and holes into people's houses. Sewage is sucked in too, becoming mixed with the drinking water and spreading the virus. An assistant to the director general for water for the Baghdad municipality, who asked to be identified only as Khalid, said that a major water project had been under way for Sadr City, but that poor security had made it impossible to proceed. THE REACH OF WAR: DISEASE IN IRAQ"
"The I.B.M. Corporation announced yesterday that it was willing to pay $10,000 each to the owners of nearly 500 contaminated homes in the upstate village of Endicott if the owners give up their right to sue for property damages caused by industrial pollution. Residents have complained that ventilation systems I.B.M. has installed in their homes since 2002 to prevent toxic vapors from building up in the basements have hurt property values. Last year they asked Attorney General Eliot Spitzer for help in protecting home values. Mr. Spitzer's office negotiated with I.B.M. for a year to develop the payment program, which is modeled after a similar effort in Rochester. Endicott officials think the payments will help revive the village, compensate homeowners for lost real estate values and allow residents to improve their homes, creating spillover economic benefits. Homeowners would not be required to use the money for home improvements. The owners of the 480 houses and a handful of commercial properties that were offered the ventilation systems are eligible to receive payments. Owners would give up the right to sue for property damages but would still be able to sue for personal injury. The program could cost I.B.M. more than $5 million, and will be another costly step in the company's efforts to remediate hazards it helped create in this upstate village just west of Binghamton, where it got its start nearly a century ago. Other manufacturers also contributed to the pollution, but only I.B.M. is helping clean it up. Last month, I.B.M. agreed to a consent order with the state to clean up the remaining pollution, a byproduct of chemicals called volatile organic compounds that were used as degreasers. Residents of Endicott had a mixed reaction to the announcement of the payment program. ''My gut reaction is that sounds like a buyout,'' said Edward M. Blaine, the director of a community outreach program who has owned a house in there for 31 years. Mr. Blaine, 52, said he was not sure that he would accept the money and give up his right to sue if he cannot sell his house at market value. ''If I had to say yes or no right now I'd probably say no,'' he said. ''I need to think about it.'' Joseph T. Havel has no doubt. ''I'm not taking it,'' Mr. Havel said. ''It's like a payoff, isn't it?'' Mr. Havel is a taxidermist who used to work in his basement until state environmental officials discovered that the plume of groundwater contamination was giving off vapors that were seeping into the many basements, including his. He has since abandoned the basement and built a workshop in the garage. ''If I tried to sell my house right now, I probably wouldn't get any more than $60,000,'' he said. ''People across the street from me have been trying to sell for over a year.'' He said the house had an assessed value of $102,000. David A. Munro, an assistant attorney general who worked with I.B.M. to develop the program, said there was no evidence that property values had declined since the vapor problem was discovered. Rose Sotak, a real estate agent whose parents owned a house in Endicott that they have willed to her 18-year-old daughter, Kristin, said sales records indicated that prices had actually increased from 1 to 5 percent a year in the last few years. Ms. Sotak said she would accept I.B.M.'s offer and put the money toward Kristin's college tuition. ''The way I look at it,'' Mrs. Sotak said, ''I.B.M. will be paying over $5 million, which will be great for the economy here.''"
