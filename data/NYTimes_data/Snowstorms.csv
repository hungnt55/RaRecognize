"What is the one thing skiers, snowboarders, snowbladers and snow-sport executives are all wearing this year? A smile. Success during a winter sports season is measured by the foot but gauged by word of mouth. Ample snow underfoot, especially for four consecutive months, means everybody gets giddy. Smiling faces communicate in volume, beaming from mountain to valley. So, we give you the winter season of 2000-1. Everywhere you look, ski areas have prime snow conditions that will last deep into April. Last week's snowstorm may have been a dud in New York City, but it buried New England and New York State with snow. The Rockies got hit again, too -- two feet in three days. And now, after two seasons of disappointing snow conditions, there is a strong possibility that this year will be a record season for skier and snowboarder visits nationally. Estimates are preliminary, but after averaging 52 million visits in the past two years, some analysts believe the final tally of skier and snowboarder visits nationwide will exceed the highest total recorded: 54.6 million visits during 1993-94. Earlier this week, Colorado Ski Country, the state's trade association, reported that skier visits were up 11 percent, or 759,000 people, from the same time a year ago. Vail announced that skier visits jumped 32.2 percent from year to year through Jan. 31, though that says more about just how bad last season was. ''We look at this year as a normal snowfall year,'' Adam Aron, the Vail Resorts chief executive officer, said. ''Last year we did not just have poor snowfall. At times we had no snowfall. We are back to a traditional Colorado winter. And skier visits have soared.'' For a more anecdotal way of judging the kind of year ski areas are having, enter a base lodge just about anywhere and look around. More smiles than usual? ''Yes, no doubt, conditions are great and people know it,'' said Skip King, vice president for communications at American Skiing Company, which operates Steamboat in Colorado and Sugarloaf, Sugarbush, Killington and Mount Snow in the East, among others. They are smiling, too, in the corporate offices. ''That's related to business levels,'' King said, ''and that's related to snowfall totals.'' Stowe, Vt., where yearly snow totals average about 260 inches, has received 300 inches. ''I've been calling it an epic season,'' Kirt Zimmer, a Stowe spokesman, said. ''For some people who have worked here or skied here for decades, it matches up against any season in memory.'' The capriciousness of the weather, most notably its extremes, has dented industry revenue in the past two seasons. In the East, there have been huge early-season storms followed by huge thaws. Stowe opened in early November last year with 3.5 feet of snow and 26 trails open. By Thanksgiving, it was down to one trail with snow. In the Rockies, La Ni√±a was blamed for a slow start to the snow season, which nearly ruined the Christmas and New Year's holidays for resorts. The total of skier/rider visits to the Rockies last year was the lowest in six years. Rain and unusually warm temperatures, even if they are only at lower elevations, also have an enormous effect on the public's perception of mountain conditions. Snow conditions, because of advanced snow-making abilities, have universally been better than people have realized in the past two seasons. But that isn't likely to sway the person deciding whether to pack the car and drive six hours, or to use a week of vacation for a trip West. Not if it is warm enough in the backyard to swing a golf club. But it is certainly not golf weather in snow country this March. Yesterday it was snowing heavily in Colorado. Still, while this season's anticipated increase in visits is good news, industry executives are aware that future prosperity will depend on retaining the skiers and riders they currently have, and introducing the children of baby boomers to the sport. After all, the skier base is aging and the snowboarding explosion is slowing. It's true that more women are trying skiing and snowboarding, but with either, women also have a disproportionately high dropout rate. This has brought about the many female-oriented programs -- women's weeks, midweek ladies ski clubs and the Take Your Daughter to the Slopes program. So there are a variety of challenges ahead. For now, the snow-sport industry can be comforted by the likelihood that it has had its best season in years, maybe ever. And if you are one of those who may have helped establish a record, there's comfort in that as well. On a variety of levels, the more the merrier. Want proof? Just look at the smiles. THE SKI REPORT"
"Shivering on the shady side of the street outside Columbia University, Tanya Henry was protesting the spring that hadn't sprung, as if underdressing and thinking warm thoughts would hasten the season's slow arrival. Sure, her fashion statement was extreme -- a thin cotton sweater over a tank top and jeans, thongs on her bare feet and new sunglasses. But her wishful thinking, with the temperature hovering in the low 40's, is common around the region these days, with lilacs in bud, daylight saving time approaching and the weather still unseasonably, unrelentingly, depressingly cold. ''I was just thinking this morning how I'm being so stubborn about the weather,'' said Ms. Henry, a 21-year-old transfer student from California, as she thawed out in a small patch of sunshine, relaxing her hunched shoulders and rubbing her hands warm. ''I'm just so sick of wearing a jacket and having my friends from home say, 'Oh, by the way, it's 75 here.' '' More than a week into the new season, after a winter of repeated snowfalls, New Yorkers are as phototropic as plants, bending toward the pale light, whenever they can find it. Yesterday, for instance, was a pitiful facsimile of a glorious spring day, the kind that prompts dutiful students and office workers to play hooky. But it was the best to come along in a while. So there was Bill Ziegelmeier, a construction worker, sunning himself in a T-shirt on the Upper West Side; Stamenka Antonova and Kimberly Stratton, graduate students in religion, lunching coatless on the steps of Low Memorial Library; and Elke Pasternack, a banker, dozing with her face tipped skyward on a bench at Rockefeller Center. ''Just seeing the sun changes me,'' said Ms. Antonova, who said she had been ''revolting against the weather'' by refusing to wear a winter coat. Her friend, Ms. Stratton, had hers draped loosely around her shoulders. Maybe she was less weary of winter weather, Ms. Antonova said, because Ms. Stratton had spent a month in hot, humid Thailand. But under the coat Ms. Stratton also showed spring plumage. Her turtlenecks these days are more likely to be lavender than black, she said. All of yesterday's sunbathers, even those in a state of partial undress, were cautiously optimistic, at best. Two days before, there had been several inches of wet snow. Windswept rain was headed this way for the weekend. There has yet to be a single day when drivers en masse rolled down their car windows, when the benches were full on Broadway or when it seemed timely to bring the porch furniture up from the basement and stow the boots away. ''You don't know how to play it until you get three or four good days in a row,'' Mr. Ziegelmeier said, positioned for optimal sunbathing against a south-facing wall. He noted that there was still frost on the lawn when he left his home in Babylon at 4:30 in the morning. The average daily departure from normal temperatures this month has been an unremarkable 2.4 degrees, according to meteorologists at Pennsylvania State University. The last two days saw high temperatures of 41 and 49, versus the normal high of 54. But the low temperatures were significantly below normal. On Tuesday, it bottomed out at 24 and yesterday at 30; the normal low for both March 27 and 28 is 38 degrees. And in the eat-your-heart-out department, consider the record highs for those back-to-back dates: 83 degrees, set in 1998, and 84, set in 1945. Not everyone, to be sure, has discarded winter clothing. The elderly remain bundled in woolen coats. Babies in strollers are swaddled in blankets. Bicycle messengers and street vendors have yet to shed their parkas and watch caps. Landscapers are dressed like lumberjacks -- or have refused the importunings of winter-weary clients and are delaying work until the ground thaws and the temperature rises. In Midtown yesterday, amid businessmen and tourists in shirtsleeves, blue-lipped and bowed against the wind, there were plenty of people in more appropriate hats and coats. Tomasita Harrison, a lawyer rushing along the Avenue of the Americas, said she was always cold and would not part with her muffler, boots, gloves and shearling coat with fur cuffs and collar ''until it's at least in the 60's.'' So, too, Phoebe Astor, strolling Fifth Avenue resplendent in a cashmere sweater set, full-length mink coat and leather gloves. ''I think I'm a very sensible person and don't just go by the calendar,'' said Ms. Astor, who said she wouldn't store her fur until May. ''Mark my words: We'll have another snowstorm yet.''"
"Seated in a 12-foot-high platform on the edge of a canary grass meadow that is being invaded by willows and an occasional tamarack, I was snapped from my usual predawn deer stand musings -- a blend of retrospection and anticipation -- by the wailing of wolves. Their eerie, high-pitched songs went on intermittently for a half-hour, and I wondered if they would drive a deer within my ken. They did not. It was the opening day of deer week in the flat farm country around Roseau, and as the eastern sky brightened, guns began to cough. The shooting one hears during deer season in this region of northwest Minnesota differs from that heard in northern Maine or New Hampshire. In remote areas of heavily forested northern New England, a single shot, sometimes followed by one more a few seconds later, is typical. In the Roseau area, one often hears rapid-fire five-shot barrages. Most of the reason for this is the open terrain. Deer are frequently shot at ranges of more than 200 yards. At such distances, a standing or walking deer -- let alone one that is running -- is a challenging target. On my first morning in my stand, some of the shooting seemed fairly close. When the members of our eight-man party left the stands at about 10 a.m. and went back to camp, I learned that none of us had shot. Only one of us, Gordon Haugen of Roseau, had seen deer. ''A doe and her fawn walked down the trail, but I was hoping for a buck and felt that I'd see one before the hunt was over,'' Haugen said. Haugen's son, Matthew, had flown in from California and Glenn Holm of Roseau was also with us. The remaining five included our host and the camp's owner, David Tilton, of Rye, N.H., his son, Daniel, of Strafford, N.H., and three people from Martha's Vineyard, Mass.: Tim Rich, my brother Dan and me. All had arrived at the camp, which is about five miles south of the Canadian border, two days before the season opened, using that time to refurbish some of our older stands, to clear away brush and branches that interfered with shooting, and to stock up provisions. There had been more than a foot of snow in Roseau about two weeks earlier, but the snow was almost gone and during our stay most days were warm and bright with the temperature rising into the low 60's, a far cry from the below-zero weather we had encountered there over at least half of the past decade. It was so mild that Rich and my brother could not resist taking spinning rods down to the Roseau River, which runs past the camp, to fish for pike, both northern and walleye. They had to work that endeavor into our deer hunting ritual, which involved getting on the stand at least a half-hour before dawn, remaining there until about 10 o'clock, returning to camp for a late breakfast, putting on one or two deer drives along the river in early afternoon, then returning to our stands late in the afternoon and remaining until sunset. Rich began catching nice northerns -- some more than five pounds -- on spoons in the muddy, rising river, and every time he landed one he raised it high before he released it so that we who were puttering about the camp could witness his success. One hundred yards upriver there was an interested observer: a bald eagle perched on a dead willow. After raising, but not hooking, a few northerns that he called ''monsters,'' Rich drove to Roseau and bought a huge lure called a bionic bucktail, and with it caught a northern nearly 3-feet long that weighed between 10 and 12 pounds. I asked him to save that fish for supper and with it we also had a five-pound walleye caught by my brother. On a deer drive along the river the afternoon of the first hunting day, a Saturday, Rich killed a large 8-point buck and a smaller four-pointer that were pushed to him. In the area we were hunting, there is a one-deer limit and that deer must be a buck unless one also has a permit to take an antlerless animal. (All of us from the East had antlerless permits.) Minnesota regulations permit any member of a deer hunting party to kill a deer for any other member. In other words, all members of a party can continue to hunt until all their deer tags have been used. Members of a group agree beforehand on whether to follow this procedure. Another drive that same afternoon moved a large doe across a field in front of me, but she bounded past before I could get a clear shot at her. Late Sunday afternoon, Tilton shot a large doe on the Manfred Holm farm across the river. Thus by evening we had only three deer for eight hunters and only one full day of hunting left. At my stand Monday morning before sunrise, a great horned owl flew out of the murk and swooped within inches of my head, so close that I could feel the wind from its wings. After the fourth such sortie, I stood up and waved my arms and it departed. Again, no deer came past my stand, but a half-hour later there were several shots from the direction of Tilton's stand. Back at camp, I learned that he had taken two does and a buck. He was, he said, about to come down from his stand when he saw a small flock of mallards leap from the Roseau River. Believing that they might have been startled by deer crossing the stream, he stayed put and 10 minutes later the animals emerged from the riverbank trees and shrubbery. By Tuesday night, both of the Tiltons had each taken a doe. Four of our group -- me, my brother and the Holm brothers -- had not fired a shot but there was a deer for each of us to take home. We also returned east with the memory of an astonishing aurora borealis display that took place on our penultimate evening at camp. It filled the sky in all directions, a glowing, streaming, pulsating play of light -- red, green, orange and gold -- that persisted for more than a half-hour. Halfway through that celestial show, the wolves began to howl. I, perhaps emboldened by vodka, was prompted to respond. Putting my head back, I took a deep breath and hurled a long-lasting, high-pitched wail into the night. A few seconds later there was an answering cry. OUTDOORS"
"Until late last Saturday night, there had been nothing seasonal about this season. People stood in lines in front of the holiday windows on Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue, wishing, in their shirt sleeves, that it was possible to feel cozy, which the holiday demands, when the thermometer reads 68 degrees. Even in the country north of the city, the grass stayed green later than it ever had. Three weeks ago it was still possible to mow the lawn meaningfully or play a round of golf without having to pretend that it somehow didn't count. But in the overnight darkness of the weekend, winter delivered. It seems unfair to call the snowfall that crossed New England and the upper tier of New York state that night a storm. It was an announcement. Waking up Sunday morning was like waking up to a page torn out of an old, familiar calendar. Wet snow clung to everything in sight, to hemlock boughs, to weed tops, to fence rails. The muffled rattle of the plows on the highway came and went, leaving a thick silence behind them. As the sky cleared toward afternoon, it was possible to remember how much brightness a covering of snow brings to these dark winter days. It seems to double the sun, just when the sun needs doubling most. The snow may have been a meteorological event, but it also felt like a moral one, if you don't mind using the word ''moral'' to describe the feeling of rightness that comes with being in time with the weather. What would New England be without the rigor of winter? Or the Catskills and Adirondacks? The five inches that fell brought grim satisfaction to those who believe that a hard winter is the spine of the region and the ballast of the passing year. Even as the past slips away, the weather seems to bring it back. The wild turkey tracks in the snow, the scraping of frozen windshields, the greater arduousness of doing almost anything outdoors, all of this returns like a continuation of last winter, as though we were just waking up from a warm-weather dream. By mid-week the snow will be gone in most places. At least now when winter finally comes, clamping down on us, it will come as no surprise."
"Gov. George E. Pataki called in the National Guard yesterday to help dig Buffalo out from under the 82.3 inches of snow that fell in the past five days. The sun finally broke through in the afternoon, but more snow was predicted for tomorrow. The storm, which began Christmas Eve, dumped about 90 percent of the precipitation that would be expected in an entire season in the city, which gets an average annual snowfall of 93.5 inches, said Tom Niziol, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Buffalo. The Buffalo airport, which was closed periodically until last night, recorded the greatest depth of snow on the ground since records started being kept, around 1870. That figure, 44 inches, beats the 42-inch record set in 1977, when snow had to be carted south of the city in railroad coal cars. (The amount at the airport is less than the five-day total because the fluffy ''lake effect'' snow from Lake Erie has melted and compacted.) This December is now the snowiest month in Buffalo history, with 83.5 inches. The 35.4 inches of snow that fell from 6 a.m. Thursday to 6 a.m. yesterday rank as the second-highest 24-hour total. The record is 37.9 inches, recorded Dec. 9-10, 1995. Paul Sullivan, the streets commissioner, said simply plowing the streets was not enough. ''It's to the point now where we have to remove the snow because the snowbanks are so high,'' he told The Associated Press. Three deaths have been attributed to the storm. An 83-year-old man in Cheektowaga, about six miles east of Buffalo, died Friday when snow collapsed his carport, and a 50-year-old woman from Lewiston, 22 miles north of Buffalo, died in a car crash on an icy road. Another person died of a heart attack after shoveling snow, said Lt. Michael March of the Buffalo police. ''We can't get the cars off the streets,'' Lieutenant March said. ''We have a driving ban, but it seems to be largely ignored, and there are stalled cars all over the streets.'' He said there were hundreds of cars clogging the streets. ''The people in Buffalo, they get along fine,'' he said. ''You'd see hundreds of people walking in the street, instead of driving cars. Most of the cars are buried in the side streets. The side streets are all unpassable.'' Still, the storm has caused less havoc than one in November 2000, when two feet of snow fell on a Monday afternoon, stranding thousands of people at school or at work, or on the way home, Mr. Niziol said. Mr. Niziol, who was not due in to work until midnight, came to work at 6:30 a.m., but wasn't complaining. ''We're hanging in there,'' he said. ''If you're as interested in weather as a meteorologist is, this is what you live for.'' About 50 National Guard trucks and bucket loaders were being sent to Buffalo from Binghamton, Syracuse and Utica. Meanwhile, at least three hospitals asked for volunteers with four-wheel-drive vehicles to take doctors and other staff to work. Elective surgery was canceled at Mercy Hospital of Buffalo, said a spokeswoman, JoAnn Cavanaugh, adding that some workers have put in double or triple shifts. Representative Jack Quinn asked President Bush to declare a state of emergency. ''The president has nicknames for everyone and he calls me the big man from Buffalo,'' Mr. Quinn, a Buffalo-area Republican, told The Associated Press. ''I'm 6-foot-5 and I'm going to tell him the snow is over the big man's head.'' The storm was a reality check for residents who had enjoyed two unusually mild months, the city's first snowless November on record, and a December with only 1.2 inches until Dec. 23. N.Y. Region"
"It has become a postmodern truism that all nature is experienced through the lens of culture. A cigar may sometimes be just a cigar, but a tree is never just a tree. No natural phenomenon fits this idea better than snow. If you shovel your own sidewalk in Buffalo, snow is a curse. If it means a day off from school, it's a blessing. In certain parts of Manhattan, which have their own peculiar culture, a snowstorm big enough to shut down street cleaning can bring a pause to the intricate rules governing alternate-side-of-the-street parking. The system is too complex to explain, but the end result is that if you leave your car buried under snow, sometimes you don't have to move it for weeks. Or if you were forward-looking enough to have bought cross-country skis in March (I think off-season sales of sports equipment qualify as a significant part of modern American culture) and to have waited patiently through a long summer only to wait even more patiently through a ridiculously warm autumn, then snow is an ever-receding object of desire. Yes, I bought skis last spring. And yes, I have learned once again, in this holiday season, the true meaning of delayed gratification. Before I describe my quest for snow, I ought to clarify one point. In claiming frugality I may not be entirely honest. The truth is that I have a weakness for outdoor gear. Some people can't resist alcohol or chocolate. I can't resist polypropylene. I'm a sucker for Gore-Tex. Ripstop nylon makes my heart sing. I have a lot of gear. Last summer I found two perfectly good camping stoves that I had forgotten about, shortly after I purchased a third. I'm not quite sure how many fishing rods I have. Our family has multiple canoes and kayaks. We're not quite at the one-boat-per-person level, but we're close. Still, it all comes in handy, sooner or later. And the proper equipment is like the right tool for the job. It enhances your effectiveness and pleasure, particularly if it's on sale. In the case of skis, you do need snow. And to go cross-country skiing in the woods, you need the real thing, not the machine-made snow that downhill centers create. I started hoping for snow in early December, which I know was wishful thinking. But I wasn't expecting snow to fall in Manhattan. I was perfectly willing to drive to the Adirondacks or Vermont. I began surfing (or perhaps I should say skiing) the Internet, checking the weather and the snow reports from cross-country ski centers. It did snow here and there, but then the weather would warm up, and the snow would melt. I would telephone ski lodges in hopes that the weather had changed and the Web site was outdated. Hello, I would say, do you have any snow? Not yet, they would say, in that cheery hotel voice, but it would come. This went on for about three weeks. At one point I decided I would drive to Canada. But the Laurentians didn't have snow either, and they were as far north as I was willing to go. Sooner or later snow had to fall. The earth was pursuing its normal orbit. I knew that because the days were getting shorter. But outside it was often T-shirt weather. Finally it snowed four or five inches in the lower Adirondacks, only about a four-hour drive from my house. The snow fell on crusty ice, a result of earlier flurries and melting. A few cross-country areas reported enough accumulation for skiing. I decided on the Garnet Hill Lodge Cross-Country Ski Center in North River, N.Y. It had almost 35 miles of trails and was near the 112,000-acre Siamese Ponds Wilderness Area, which was new to me. I am more familiar with the High Peaks region of the Adirondacks, farther north. The mountains in the Siamese Ponds area are lower, and the terrain less dramatic. But I've read that the backcountry trails get less traffic than those in the High Peaks area. Of all the ski centers I had checked on the Web, Garnet Hill gave the most optimistic view of snow conditions. When I called, the woman at the desk said: ''Yes, we have snow. You'll have trouble getting up the driveway.'' I left at 2:30 in the afternoon. I drove up the New York State Thruway, through the brown countryside, doubting all the way. Northward migration is a standard pattern for skiers, but I still find it hard to imagine the season's first covering of snow when the weather at home is so warm. About three hours into the trip, I saw white patches on the median. And when I got off the highway in Warrensburg, there was dirty snow on the ground at the gas station. Finally, driving up the road to the lodge, with snowflakes in the air and white ground in the woods, I felt that I had found winter. The next morning brought more falling snow when I went to try the trails at the Garnet Hill ski center. Two trails were open and groomed, and I took the easiest. Even so, I experienced first-time wobblies at the first slightly downhill portion of the trail. Bits of grass and rock peeked through the trail on a few occasions because the snow was only four or five inches deep, but most of the trail was smooth. Seeing snow among the evergreens was immensely satisfying, and the new skis were perfect. I did, however, realize that I was completely overdressed and working up a sweat, which brought to mind the issue of how involved you should get in your gear. If you get too involved, you lose sight of the reason you have it in the first place. In the old days, when everyone had wooden skis and waxed them according to arcane recipes, there were always people who spent more time waxing than they did skiing. On the other hand, if you don't pay enough attention to technical preparations, it is difficult to direct your attention away from your own discomfort to the world out there. Skis that stick or slide backward make skiing impossible. I solved that problem with waxless skis. But overheating can be an unpleasant distraction, or dangerous, depending on the weather. After my morning ski, I shed my long underwear and lined jacket and bought ski pants and a shell. Blue jeans would have worked, since it was so warm and I wasn't going far, but cotton gets wet easily and then provides no warmth. Besides, the new pants were windproof, water resistant and wicked sweat away. With my new clothes I drove a few minutes to the Siamese Ponds Wilderness Area, all protected state lands with ungroomed trails. At Garnet Hill I could hear machinery in the distance grooming trails, but the wilderness area was so quiet that the creaking of trees was startling. This was midweek and absolutely no one was around. If possible, the snow seemed softer and whiter. The beginning of the trail, which I skied, is a flat woods road with few turns and dips. The trail turns more challenging farther on. For my first taste of snow this season I was satisfied with the feeling of the deep woods and the sight of bent, snowy boughs along the trail that sometimes seemed to form a wall. I breathed in winter in its most benign form. The weather was just above freezing, the flakes in the air weren't threatening, the snow seemed comforting and warming in the way that calling it a blanket suggests. And I was warm and dry, with no waxing worries, free to look around and outward, rather than concentrating on the constellation of uncomfortable sensations that accompany the wrong equipment. For this trip I knew I didn't really need the new shell and pants that I bought, but I will later, on longer ski trips, farther into the woods, in colder temperatures and deeper snow, which will come, sooner or later. I hope.

"The honest work life of Selassie Bourne began yesterday at half past seven in the morning. The city put a shovel in his hand. Son of Brooklyn, former dealer in controlled substances and one-time resident of the Green Meadow, Clinton and Coxsackie Correctional Facilities, Mr. Bourne was soon bent double at the northwest corner of Houston Street and First Avenue in Manhattan, helping the city dig out from its worst winter storm. In his pocket was the makeshift card that bore his picture and his emergency snow laborer's identification number: ME03-033. In his future was something more surprising and unusual than that: an honest day's pay. ''It's been a long time since I done work like this,'' said Mr. Bourne, 30, who said he had served two terms for narcotics distribution. His face still bears the scar he obtained when a fellow inmate tried to carve him up on Thanksgiving Day 1993. ''It's a good thing, too,'' he said, tossing back some ice to let pass a wet armada of pedestrians. ''It's a beautiful thing to help the city out.'' If you crossed the street yesterday, or parked your car, or stood in line for the bus, you might owe thanks to men like Mr. Bourne. Dozens of them woke in the dark and reported to a city-owned garage. They cleared the snow piled up at bus stops, curbs and crosswalks, sucking wind on your behalf. For their trouble, they were paid a daily wage of $10 an hour, minus taxes, to be mailed out in official city checks. There is fast money, slow money, and then there is snow money, said Mr. Bourne -- a wage that, while hardly stingy, is not intended to make one rich. The work is cold and wet and hurts the lower back, and numbness often finds the toes. One develops an understanding of precipitation in its various forms: slush, for example, is several times more difficult to move than ice or snow. Nonetheless, snow money is preferable to no money -- and no money is what Mr. Bourne had been earning, save his brief stint as a porter for Educational Alliance, which runs a group home for drug abusers ''involved with the Criminal Justice System,'' according to its Web site. It was the good folks at Educational Alliance who helped him make his way from the home on Avenue D to the sanitation shed off the South Street viaduct yesterday morning. There, he was introduced to his city shovel -- a solid back, square point D-grip with a steel blade and a 27-inch northern white ash shaft. ''We're the ones making the city work today,'' he said. ''It's like a second chance at life.'' The first chance did not turn out so well for Mr. Bourne. It included ''life in the ghetto'' and ''being around the negative crowd,'' he said. He worked 28th Street and Mermaid Avenue in Coney Island, selling crack cocaine from the time he was 12, he said. He was caught twice and each time spent three years behind bars. Out the second time, he swore he would change. Got married: she in white, he in a tux -- ''a good one,'' he said. Had two boys, Justice and Selassie Jr. ''I loved them more than I loved the streets.'' But, in July, the streets won out after Mr. Bourne was caught a third time selling drugs. A state judge sentenced him to 12 months at Educational Alliance. He entered the program in October and is working toward a maintenance degree. Then came Sunday morning and the storm. And so the man who once took in $1,000 a day, who drove a Nissan Maxima, whose hands and chest were draped with gold, picked up a shovel. Picked it up and set off dutifully to dig out every fire hydrant on First Avenue from Houston Street to East 14th. For $10 an hour. With double-socked feet. With no one to thank him but the dogs. ''It feels good,'' he said. ''There's no police. No stick-up kids. My mind's at ease. Until the snow melts, I'll be working. Long as it snows, I'm going to be here.'' A RECORD SNOWFALL: MANHATTAN"
"It is a measure of New York's impatience that the city does not wait for snow to melt. It has machines to do the job -- big, noisy orange machines that warm snow to the consistency of a Sno-Kone or Slurpee that has been around too long. After filtering out debris like salt, the melting machines flush their newly made slush into the sewer system through an orange tube. The diesel-powered machines can melt and dispose of up to 60 tons an hour -- a lot of snow, even in the context of the biggest winter storm in New York City history, Rocco DiRico, an assistant sanitation commissioner, said yesterday. He was standing downtown, on a one-block stretch of Broad Street between Water and South Streets that had been turned into a staging area for a melter running at full speed. That block, like others around the city where melters were stationed yesterday, was the finish line of a complicated relay race. Large Sanitation Department trucks arrived with snow from other places, creating fresh mountains of snow. In turn, smaller front-loaders moved the snow from the mountain to the melter, scoop by scoop. Sanitation officials said the snow was from Wall Street and from Broadway near Worth Street. Mr. DiRico watched a front-loader align itself behind the melting machine, raise its scoop and drop its entire contents of snow into the melter. ''It's a giant hot tub in there,'' Mr. DiRico said. ''That's exactly what it is.'' But the inside of the melter is also like a washing machine. In addition to the warm water, there is an agitator to keep the mixture turning. Mr. DiRico said that water temperature of 60 degrees was ideal, because a pile of snow is so cold that it does not liquefy instantly. To generate that kind of heat, the melter needs a lot of low-sulfur fuel. It has an 800-gallon fuel tank and burns 80 gallons an hour, he said. Since 2000, the city has bought 20 of the melting machines, which cost $200,000 apiece, Mr. DiRico said. The department sends them out when there is what he called ''significant snow,'' and officials like the flexibility of being able to send them to different places, depending on where the snow piles up. The melters appealed to the Sanitation Department because it stopped dumping snow into the East River in the 1990's amid environmental concerns -- specifically, that the dumped snow collected by plows contained salt used on the streets to make driving safe. Now the city has mobile refueling trucks that can drive from melter to melter. The melters could operate around the clock, Mr. DiRico said, except that filters need to be cleaned from time to time. He said workers do that after each 12-hour shift. As one front-loader pulled away from the melter and another one sidled up, Mr. DiRico said, ''If we could, we'd melt the snow before it hits the ground.'' A RECORD SNOWFALL: THE CLEANUP"
"While the weekend's record-breaking storm left 12 to 27 inches of snow from Virginia to coastal Maine, it spared Vermont, New Hampshire and western Maine, much to the regret of ski lift operators, snowmobile clubs and businesses already reeling from a warmer-than-normal winter. ''It makes me sick that you guys got that snow down there, and I'm sure you don't want it. It would be like falling gold up here, no doubt about it,'' said Ann Shangraw, president of the Vermont Association of Snow Travelers. Association members have access to the state's snowmobile trails, about 80 percent of which are closed because of a lack of snow, Ms. Shangraw said. Annual memberships, which are $65 to $95 plus local club dues, have dropped by half, to about 18,000, because of the warm weather. ''We haven't even had six inches,'' said Ms. Shangraw, who lives in Williamstown, Vt. ''I could rake my lawn if I wanted to, and usually I can ride right out of my house.'' While most large ski resorts with snowmaking equipment are faring well because of the low temperatures in the past week, smaller downhill resorts and cross-country areas are slashing the number of available trails and, in some cases, struggling to stay open. Magic Mountain in Londonderry, Vt., opened on Monday, the first weekday since Jan. 30, thanks to four inches from the weekend storm coupled with manmade snow. ''It's catastrophically bad,'' said Michael Gerow, a lift operator there. ''We're fighting it tooth and nail all the way, no question about that.'' Across northern New England ice fishing tournaments have been called off, while the New England Sled Dog Club in Andover, Vt., has canceled or postponed three of its five races this year because of a lack of snow. But some areas with snowmaking ability could not be happier that areas like Boston and New York City bore the brunt of the storm. ''It's great. What we find is that when people get snow in their backyards they think about skiing and snowboarding,'' said Laurie Newton, a spokeswoman for Mount Snow in West Dover, Vt., which got four inches Sunday and where 79 of 104 trails were open. ''When you're in this business, you expect the ups and downs of the weather. To be honest, we know the snow will come; it's just a question of when.'' Others are not so optimistic. Warren Miller, the owner of the Elmore General Store in Elmore, Vt., said that on a normal winter weekend 600 to 800 snowmobilers gas up and take a break for sandwiches and coffee at his store. Last weekend about a dozen stopped in, Mr. Miller said. ''We've been here 24 years, and this is our worst ever,'' he said. ''There's flat out no snow. When there's no snow, there's no business in Elmore. It's that simple.'' The region is only about five or six inches below its normal snowfall totals, with 46.8 inches having fallen in Burlington, Vt., so far this year, said John Goff, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service there. An abnormally warm and rainy January made things melt quickly, Mr. Goff said, although it has been very cold in recent days. For some ski areas, the problem is not a lack of snow but a perception that the slopes are not covered. ''People come up here on a whim thinking that the conditions won't be that great, but they try anyway and are extremely surprised at how well-kept the mountains are,'' said Matt Zogby, a spokesman for Killington Mountain, Vt., which used 10 million gallons of water last week to make snow. ''It hasn't been all bad for us, and now that the temperatures are staying a lot colder, it improves the amount of snow we can make.'' Art Woolf, a professor of economics at the University of Vermont, said he could not declare this winter a bust because not all of the economic data had been reported. But, he said, all signs point to a bad season for winter businesses. ''I can't believe it's going to be a very good year,'' Professor Woolf said. ''It's just a light snowfall year. The impulse travelers are the ones who are probably not going to be here this year.'' He added: ''I think you'll see a lot of people not going to Vermont this weekend and staying in Massachusetts to ski.''"
"THE Oscar-nominated film ''Good Night, and Good Luck'' recalls a journalism hero from the early days of television news, Edward R. Murrow. Not only was he a giant of the craft, the movie shows us, but he also wore great suits and really knew how to hold a cigarette. Many years have passed, though, since Murrow was riding high. Don't we need a new hero for today's tough challenges? Were anyone to ask us -- and, granted, no one has -- our candidate might be a CNN reporter named Chris Huntington. On Sunday, the day of the big snow, he pretty much said on camera that some of what now passes for journalism in television can be downright silly. In this age of Geraldo-style self-promotion, that acknowledgment qualified as nothing short of heroism. Mr. Huntington won us over when he went to Prospect Park in Brooklyn, and stood there as snow fell, to inform us that it was snowing. He seemed almost embarrassed to have to do it. But such is the tyranny of the live stand-up, as essential to modern television as stage pyrotechnics are to Andrew Lloyd Webber. It is used even when the point being made is so obvious that no performance for the camera is needed. It is used even when nothing is going on. ''Well, Bud,'' the reporter tells the anchor on the 11 o'clock news, ''I'm standing tonight in front of the courthouse. Nothing is going on because the place has been empty for hours. But earlier today '' With weather stories, it seems obligatory to make reporters stand in the rain or the wind or the snow to say little more than that it is raining or windy or snowing. It is one thing to report on real people coping with a snowstorm like Sunday's -- digging out their cars, shoveling sidewalks, waiting through long train delays or sledding in the park (a k a ''a winter wonderland''). But to just stand there and say it is snowing amounts, some would say, to little more than look-at-us showboating. Mr. Huntington, bless his soul, conceded as much as he reported live from Prospect Park during ''Reliable Sources,'' a CNN show about the news-gathering business. The host, Howard Kurtz, asked him what he was ''accomplishing journalistically'' by getting snowed on. Mr. Huntington replied: ''I'm so glad you've asked me that question, because every time we get assigned to do these stories, I always say to whoever will listen, 'Why in the world should anybody at home believe me or think that I'm an intelligent person if I'm going to stand out here in the bad weather and tell you at home that there's bad weather out here?' It seems to me that there's a certain sort of oxymoronic exercise that we carry out.'' For our money, he could have dropped the ''oxy.'' But hip, hip, hooray. What he said was admirably forthright, even bold, given the widely shared ethic in certain corners of journalism that, in general, no matter what the news may be, the story should always be about us. The devotion to needless theatrics came into sharp focus during the devastating hurricanes of last summer and fall. Perhaps the most laughable example was a stand-up in Florida that the NBC weatherman Al Roker did at the height of Hurricane Wilma in October. Until the fierce winds knocked him to his hands and knees and forced him indoors, Mr. Roker stood storm-tossed on the balcony of his hotel room, anchored by a colleague who held him tightly by the legs, out of camera range. What was supposed to be the real story: Wilma or Al Roker? At the time, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida pronounced that style of razzle-dazzle ''a little annoying.'' ''To see these characters on television reporting the news and putting themselves in harm's way doesn't do much good,'' he said, and added: ''Creates a bad example, I think, for others. They think somehow this is fun. It isn't fun. It's very dangerous.'' Those words came to mind Sunday night while watching the late news on Channel 7. A reporter went to Times Square for a live stand-up about four people who had endured electric shocks hours earlier when they stepped on a metal plate covering Con Edison wires with faulty insulation. Metal plates can be hazardous, the reporter said, noting that at that moment he himself was standing on a metal plate. D'oh! Suddenly, standing in the snow to say it was snowing seemed almost sensible. NYC E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com"
"No one disputes it: The weekend snowstorm was the biggest since record-keeping began in 1869, delivering 26.9 inches to New York City in 24 hours. That's a half-inch more than the old record, set in 1947 by a swirling blizzard still described in awed tones by those who lived through it. This one will go down in the history books. And yet. Even as the snow fell, and fell and fell, late Saturday and throughout Sunday, it never felt like the end of the world. Almost no one lost power. No one died from the storm. Hospitals were not swamped with shoveling-related heart attacks. No state, county, city or borough of emergency was declared. By yesterday, life in the city felt amazingly normal, especially once the sun came out. Every single street was plowed and salted by morning in New York City, according to the Sanitation Department, so school was open and commuters could commute, if slowly. The snowscape had already become an inconvenience rather than a monument. Whither the sense (except, of course, at the airports) of having survived an Ordeal, the we're-all-in-this-together camaraderie that New Yorkers are periodically famous for? Old-timers still speak reverently of the chaos and death wrought by the great blizzard of 1947 and the hardy resourcefulness it necessitated. New Yorkers of many ages can recall the blizzard of Jan. 7-8, 1996, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani closed the streets to nonemergency traffic, ordered New Yorkers to stay home from work and all but declared martial law. Now that was a snowstorm for the books. The mayor said so himself. ''The city is being hit with the largest storm it's ever had,'' he announced gravely at City Hall. While he wasn't correct in the boring technical sense -- a piddling 20.2 inches fell -- in the perhaps more important perceptual sense he was. So if this weekend's storm was really the biggest, why did it not feel like it? Meteorologists and historians offered several reasons. The timing of the storm was obviously a big one. There was no rush hour to disrupt on Sunday, and the snow stopped soon enough for the plows to get in gear. The city had plenty of warning, and because the winter had been mostly a washout until then, the stockpiles of road salt were full. Another big one was -- for lack of a better phrase -- the fluffy effect. Because the track of this storm was relatively far offshore, it did not pack the wallop of wet warm ocean air that northeasters can, so the snow was dry and fluffy. Very, very fluffy. Like a Persian cat in a roomful of hair dryers. Thus it blew right off tree branches rather than snapping them down onto power lines. It practically shoveled itself. Perhaps perception, and the psychological need to embrace and even exaggerate the old days in one's memory, has led to past blizzards' being described in apocalyptic terms. Then again, people were shorter then, so the drifts may well have seemed deeper. Seriously. In 1947, New Yorkers were, on average, more than an inch shorter than they are today. In 1888, when the blizzard that is branded on the city's collective memory as the Greatest of All Time hit New York, people were, on average, about three inches shorter. ''That would affect people's impressions of getting through deep snow,'' said Richard H. Steckel, an economics professor at Ohio State University, who has analyzed changes in human height. Also, back in 1888, the tallest building in the city was 11 stories. Billy Slavin and Earl Williams were not around in 1888, but they were in New York in 1947. Mr. Slavin is a retired Sanitation Department tow-truck driver. Mr. Williams, 65, drives a gypsum truck. As they sipped their midday beverages yesterday at the H. & S. Cichon American Legion Post in Elm Park, Staten Island, the men were talking meteorological history. They have seen their share of storms. In 1996, it took Mr. Williams two days to get out of the driveway. In 1978, his colleagues had to walk home from work because there was no way to drive. In 1947, Mr. Slavin's father had to walk out the front window to get to work. News of the record-breaking storm that rolled through this weekend did not particularly impress Mr. Slavin. ''They keep records for Central Park,'' Mr. Slavin said. ''This is Elm Park.'' Mr. Slavin hit on another mitigating aspect of this storm. There really was less snow in Elm Park. And it wasn't just Elm Park. Borough Park, Ozone Park, Parkchester, Park Ridge, Minnewaska State Park, the Vince Lombardi Park & Ride -- just about any park other than Central, the record-breaking storm actually broke no record at all. For according to Geoff Cornish, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University, the heaviest snow fell in a 15-mile-wide band that passed directly over Midtown Manhattan, the southeastern Bronx and northwestern Queens. Thus La Guardia Airport in Flushing received 9 inches more snow than Kennedy, and nobody in Brooklyn saw even 20 inches, let alone two feet. In fact, of the 17.7 million people who live in the National Weather Service district that includes Central Park, fewer than half live in counties that recorded a two-foot snowfall. One more thing. Not to cast doubt on a record -- or on the hard-working people who keep it -- but do you know who measures the snow at Central Park? The security guards at the zoo. They read the numbers off a stick set in a flat, tree-ringed clearing near the sea lion pool. Therefore, the words, ''According to the National Weather Service, the snowfall in Central Park'' actually mean, ''According to the security guards at the Central Park Zoo.'' In the final analysis, it's hard to imagine what old-timers will tell the young ones about this storm in 60 years, if anything. ''Grandpa, you were around during the great Blizzard of '06?'' ''Well, it wasn't technically a blizzard, son, but yes.'' ''Jeepers! What was it like?'' ''It was, uh, snowy. I think I went sledding a couple of times. We had school the next day.'' The boy returns to his cereal. A RECORD SNOWFALL: THE RECORD Correction: February 15, 2006, Wednesday A map yesterday with an article about the relative absence of disruptions in the New York region during the weekend snowstorm misstated a figure in some copies for the snow that had fallen at La Guardia Airport by 7 p.m. Sunday. It was 25.4 inches, not 19.5."
"A decent snowplow driver reporting to work the day after a major snowstorm must contend not only with snow, but also with plowing guilt. ''I feel bad,'' said Jim Matera as his 16-ton salt spreader lodged a load of solid snow yesterday afternoon against a partly buried (afterward a fully buried) eggplant Mitsubishi Galant in Rego Park, Queens. ''Sometimes I tell people, 'I'm sorry, I know you just dug out your sidewalk, and here comes all this snow.' '' It weighed heavily on Mr. Matera, a bespectacled, boyish man of 38, as he maneuvered his Sanitation Department truck, affixed with a 12-foot-wide plowing blade, down 63rd Avenue and up Saunders Street. It did not, however, keep Mr. Matera, the son of a retired sanitation worker, from his work. Using both plowing and a mixture of salt and calcium chloride, he cleared a lane, though much of the snow from the street simply found a new resting place elsewhere. ''A crosswalk,'' Mr. Matera muttered, shaking his head. It was the immutable law of snow: Snow moved from the street will take up space somewhere else. There were none of the highly touted snow melting machines in Rego Park yesterday, except the sun, and it was no match for the mounds of snow. So the job of clearing the roads fell to Mr. Matera and his 68 colleagues from Queens District 6 who worked 12-hour shifts to move, push and redistribute the sea of snow. On Booth Street, a man standing in the street in front of 63-48 began waving frantically at the sight of Mr. Matera's advancing truck. The man had been using a garden shovel to dig out his car -- one could only guess at how long he had been digging -- and the waving was not a friendly salutation. ''Sorry,'' Mr. Matera said under his breath, as the spreader lumbered past, tossing snow into a clear driveway. The man leaned on his shovel in defeat. Mr. Matera's spreader was also responsible for clearing entire blocks for curbside parking, but there was little thanks for that, as the spreader would be long gone by the time any grateful drivers pulled into any spots. ''You get people who get irate and nasty,'' said Mr. Matera's supervisor, Mike Casella. He added that residents sometimes hurled shovels as well as insults at the trucks. Not to mention the calls to 311. Of course, when one thinks of snowplows and Queens, what comes to mind is the almost legendary showdown of 1969, when residents accused Mayor John V. Lindsay of forgetting them and leaving large areas unplowed for days. What, then, to make of all these complaints of too much plowing? ''Queens is -- we have a large population of well-read people, I'll put it that way,'' Mr. Casella said. ''They know what's available to them and know how to use it.'' One resident of Cromwell Crescent beseeched Mr. Matera to plow her side of the street (he apologized, again, and said someone would be by later). He continued liberating the narrow street, even as the displaced snow made the plowed footpath on the sidewalk even narrower. But that was a rare request for plowing on an otherwise thankless outing. Then, on Harrow Street, as Mr. Matera's spreader turned the corner, a woman getting into a freshly dug-out vehicle looked uneasily at the plow. ''Is he going to block me?'' she called out. Mr. Casella, who had accompanied the spreader, said that Mr. Matera was not headed her way. ''He's not going to plow?'' the woman asked. ''All right. Thank you.'' A RECORD SNOWFALL: QUEENS"
"Alex Walborn, a Brooklyn mailman, had one foot in the slush and the other in the snow. ''People just don't shovel the corners,'' he grumbled, lifting a fully loaded letter carrier's cart as he waded gingerly through a crosswalk on Prospect Park West, the main shopping artery of Windsor Terrace. ''The corners are the worst of it,'' Mr. Walborn said. ''But what can you do?'' His determination was shared yesterday by people across New York City, as the rhythms of city life returned largely to normal after the weekend snowstorm. Windsor Terrace, a neighborhood of about 50 Brooklyn blocks sandwiched between Prospect Park and the Green-Wood Cemetery, was an especially good place to observe how one archetypal New York City neighborhood, and its various institutions, recovered. ''We're doing O.K.,'' said Louise O'Connor, the parish secretary at Holy Name of Jesus Roman Catholic Church, a neighborhood anchor for more than 120 years. Yesterday, it canceled classes at its primary school because of the snow, but not its 7 a.m. Mass. Ms. O'Connor said that about 20 people attended the early service, as usual, and that by early afternoon, although the church stood ready to help shut-ins or elderly people unable to cope with the record snowfall, no one had called. ''This is a neighborly kind of neighborhood,'' she said. ''People can rely on help from down the block, so why call the church?'' So it seemed along the Windsor Terrace side streets, many of them lined with the rounded facades of three-story brick row houses, where many families have been rooted for generations. Like much of Brooklyn, the neighborhood has experienced a rapid influx of affluent new residents from Manhattan and beyond, but it retains a large population of municipal workers -- police officers, firefighters, sanitation workers -- and a long tradition of self-sufficiency. On Windsor Place near Howard Place, James Dolan, a 69-year-old retired sanitation worker, teamed up with his daughter, Ann Vasquez, 43, to shovel out their cars. Both live nearby, in houses a block apart. ''We're just fooling around,'' said Mr. Dolan, who had taken to the task with little sense of urgency, seeming more intent on spending time with his daughter The snow, which by midafternoon still clogged some sidewalks, produced strange neighborhood vignettes. Deliverymen with grocery carts and mothers with strollers crossed paths in the middle of side streets. A normally popular Prospect Park playground at the foot of Seeley Street was all but abandoned, with snow piled high against its swing set and benches. But Joe Gallo, manager of the United Meat Market on Prospect Park West, said the storm had done little to interfere with business. ''We got lucky this time,'' said Mr. Gallo, who drove from his home in Bay Ridge and opened the store at 8 a.m. By 9 a.m., he said, trucks had arrived with an unusually large delivery of poultry and meats that he had ordered on Friday after his customers, anticipating the storm, emptied his coolers and shelves. At Prospect Park West and 15th Street, where Windsor Terrace meets a main entrance to Prospect Park, customers filled the Connecticut Muffin coffee shop by 11 a.m. Redovane Kerroume, the manager, said that business had been slow after he opened at 6 a.m. ''It was about 9 a.m. when the winter sun came out,'' he said. ''People decided they needed their coffee.'' Two customers, Peter Baiamonte, 33, and Julie Benedetto, 27, drank their coffee outdoors, sitting next to off-road bicycles that they had already given a brisk workout in Prospect Park, Both are freelance photographers and cycling enthusiasts, and they said they decided to ride in the park because of the heavy snow, not despite it. They rode for an hour in the park, pedaling for five miles along narrow footpaths that had been trampled by people, not plows. ''We did fall down a lot,'' Ms. Benedetto said. ''But it is only snow.'' A RECORD SNOWFALL: BROOKLYN"
"As commuters throughout the New York region returned to work yesterday, the routines of daily life had a hit-or-miss quality. Major city streets were cleared, but officials warned of possible floods from melting snow as meteorologists projected midweek temperatures in the low 50's. The city's public schools were open, though many Catholic schools were closed. On the economic front, companies reported delays in deliveries, but hotels and restaurants said stranded travelers seemed to make up for canceled reservations. The storm crippled the morning rush on the Long Island Rail Road, but the city's subways and buses largely ran on schedule. Many air travelers had to grapple with the lingering effects of the storm: at 6 a.m., LaGuardia Airport became the last of the region's three major airports to reopen, yet a shortage of planes on the ground there forced the cancellation of about 100 outbound flights and an equal number of arrivals. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg called the northeaster, which began late Saturday and ended late Sunday, ''the biggest snowstorm in the city's history.'' Parts of the region, however, received much less snow than Central Park, where the snowfall was the deepest ever recorded, 26.9 inches. Since the storm left the region and warmer weather was returning, the city shifted its efforts from clearing major traffic arteries to tackling the mounds of snow that have arisen like pyramids at street corners. Some side streets, like Park Place in Lower Manhattan, were all but given over to hills of snow taken there by the city's trucks. The city's sanitation commissioner, John J. Doherty, said he was particularly concerned about removing the snow piles at 300,000 street corners and making sure that the adjacent sewer drains were clear. ''That's what I'm really concerned about, those catch basins,'' he said. ''As it gets warm, you're already seeing flooding on the corners. I mean, you've got to wear your high boots out there or be a great broad jumper. You can't get through the intersections right now, and that's frustrating.'' Mr. Doherty said his department gave building and property owners four hours after the end of the snowfall to clear their sidewalks. Only ''a very small number'' of summonses, if any, were issued to violators, he said, in part because his enforcement agents were being used to oversee squads of temporary workers hired to shovel snow for $10 an hour, or $15 after 40 hours. By late yesterday, more than 500 had been hired. The police said that a sanitation employee, Anatoly Zaborsky, 60, crashed his plow yesterday into two vehicles at 85th Street and 34th Avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens, and was charged with driving while intoxicated. Some hospitals reported taking in patients with storm-related injuries. St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan in Greenwich Village treated a man who was knocked unconscious when a snow-laden storefront awning collapsed on his head, said Dr. Yves M. Duroseau, director of urgent care. He said he also saw several slip-and-fall injuries. At Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, Dr. Joseph Feldman, chairman of the emergency department, said ''we had some partial finger amputations'' from snowblower accidents. The leftover snow snarled commutes for tens of thousands of riders. The Long Island Rail Road, which cut back service during the storm, did not resume carrying Manhattan-bound passengers into Pennsylvania Station until about 7:15 a.m., and full service was not restored on the Port Washington branch until 2:19 p.m. Two hours later, as the outbound rush began, signal problems in an East River tunnel caused the railroad to cancel three trains due to leave between 4:43 and 5:11. A fourth train, the 4:54 to Farmingdale, was taken out of service because of equipment problems at Jamaica, Queens. The snow also halted service between Ronkonkoma and Greenport, forcing the railroad to run shuttle buses until 5:17. For many, the storm's aftermath disrupted everyday routines. School attendance citywide yesterday was 62 percent, though it was 87 percent on the last three Mondays. Elementary school attendance yesterday was 66 percent, middle school 65 percent, and high school 52 percent. The city's decision to keep schools open angered some parents. ''I have no idea why it's open after the worst snowstorm New York City ever had,'' said Louisa Ruby, 46, whose twin girls are third graders at Public School 321 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where some parents pulled their children to school on sleds. ''What is the mayor trying to prove?'' Her daughter Emily chimed in, ''I would really rather be throwing snowballs and playing with my friends than going to school.'' At a news conference, Mayor Bloomberg said: ''There was no reason to close public schools today. What we're trying to do is to get our kids an education that they're going to need for the rest of their lives.'' He added that while ''the streets were certainly passable,'' it was ''probably a little bit annoying for some people, a little bit tougher to get to school on a day like today.'' Catholic schools in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island were closed yesterday. Local superintendents for each borough made their decisions separately on Sunday night, said Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York, adding that he expected the schools to be open today. At Catholic schools in Brooklyn and Queens, the decision was left to individual principals. Car owners are in luck. Alternate-side-of-the-street parking rules will be suspended today, but parking meter rules are being enforced and city officials urged people to dig out their cars from the snow. By certain measures, business activity in the city was slower than usual yesterday, a drop-off that may have been partly due to the observation of Lincoln's Birthday, which, while not a legal holiday, is treated as a day off by some employers. A Midtown tourism information center logged far fewer visitors than normal, and theaters reported that cancellations by out-of-town ticket holders were up, although some of the tickets were grabbed by bargain seekers. Courier services reported that the number of requests for deliveries from corporate offices, retail stores and other customers was down as much as 50 percent. Food distributors in the Bronx saw their delivery operations brought to a crawl because of the snow, but most remained open or were closed for only a short time, said Bruce Reingold, general manager of Hunts Point Cooperative Market, a wholesale meat market that serves about 200 tractor-trailers a day. ''Sunday is a heavy day for us, because everyone's inventory runs low at the end of the week and they need deliveries,'' he said yesterday. ''Every small street around here was blocked. It was taking trucks 45 minutes just to get down the street. But today, things are getting back to normal.'' Aftermath"
"The process of measuring snowfall accumulation relies on the work of trained volunteers who brave the cold to take strictly controlled measurements at exacting six-hour intervals, according to the National Weather Service. In New York and its suburbs, thousands of volunteers have been trained in the procedures, and hundreds provided readings from their backyards, parks or other locations during the storm yesterday, said Jeff Tongue, a meteorologist with the agency's Brookhaven office. The volunteers use a tool called a snowboard, which is a square piece of plywood that is placed flat on the ground before any snow falls. An aluminum rod similar to a yardstick but delineated at intervals of one-tenth of an inch is then inserted into the snow over the board to measure the depth of the snow, he said. Mr. Tongue said that the volunteers were instructed to take measurements at 7 a.m., 1 p.m., 7 p.m. and 1 a.m. These intervals are intended to compensate for the snow compressing as time passes, and accumulations appearing to decline over time. The volunteers take 10 separate readings over the snowboard at each reading time and then average the measurements. Typically, he said, volunteers send their findings by e-mail message to their regional National Weather Service offices, and meteorologists use the data to put together the first reports on accumulation. Those first reports, like the ones yesterday that found a record snowfall in New York City, are considered preliminary. Measurements compiled by a smaller and more highly trained group of observers, including people working at the region's airports and the Central Park Zoo, are used to calculate the final amount of snow that is entered in the record book. Those readings are calculated at the National Climatic Data Center Mr. Tongue said the data center would probably have the final amount of yesterday's snowfall ready in about two weeks. A RECORD SNOWFALL: ACCUMULATION"
"The biggest winter storm in New York City history -- destined for lionization as the Blizzard of '06 -- buried the region and much of the Northeast yesterday under blowing, drifting, thigh-high snows that crippled transportation and commerce, knocked out power and disrupted life for millions in 14 states. After two months of humbug winter, the region awoke to a milk-white morning and an awesome storm that exceeded all forecasts, with snowfalls that transformed straw-drab landscapes into February postcards and brought out skiers, sledders and other wonderlanders. Plows were out in force, too, and working around the clock. But there was so much snow that only major arteries were expected to be open for the start of the workweek today, and officials forecast sluggish commuting for anyone who failed to take mass transit. Schools will be open in New York City, but not in some other areas. The storm -- a great Crab nebula 1,200 miles long and 500 miles wide on satellite images and a ghostly apparition on the ground -- crawled up the Eastern Seaboard overnight with winds that gusted up to 60 miles an hour, and cloaked the cities and countrysides from North Carolina to coastal Maine with 12 to more than 27 inches of snow, which broke or challenged records in many locales. A total of 26.9 inches fell in Central Park, the most since record-keeping began in 1869, the National Weather Service reported. In what weather experts called a remarkable and relentless fall that began late Saturday afternoon and ended late yesterday, it eclipsed the legendary blow of Dec. 26-27, 1947, which dropped 26.4 inches and killed 77 people. It also easily surpassed the memorable No. 3 and No. 2 storms, of Jan. 6-7, 1996, which left 20.2 inches, and March 12-14, 1888, the notorious Blizzard of '88, which dropped 21 inches. Announcing itself at dawn over New York with theatrical claps of thunder and lightning that roused some people from sleep, the storm dropped snow at phenomenal rates of 3 to 5 inches an hour between dawn at 7 a.m. and early afternoon, obliterating the skyline and anything more than a few feet away. During that time, more than 14 inches fell in Central Park and 16 inches at La Guardia Airport, where the snow topped out at 25.4 inches, another record. ''That's about as hard as it can snow in New York City, and it's extremely rare,'' said Jeff Warner, a meteorologist with Pennsylvania State University. Across the region, the 24-hour accumulations were equally awesome: 24.5 inches in the Bronx and in New Rochelle in Westchester County, 21.3 inches in Newark, 20 inches in Saddle Brook, N.J., 19.9 inches in Islip, N.Y., 26 inches in Danbury, Conn., and 30.2 inches in Fairfield, Conn., the highest in the region. Elsewhere, accumulations were 19 inches in Robbinsville, N.C.; 12 inches in Leesburg, Va.; 8.8 inches in Washington; 15.5 inches in Hockessin, Del. and 22.5 inches in Columbia Hills, Md. Oddly, the record snowstorm in New York City was not technically a blizzard there, although it met the criteria on Long Island and elsewhere: winds of at least 35 miles an hour for three consecutive hours, and visibility of less than a quarter mile. Whatever its official status in Gotham, the storm, a classic northeaster, was so powerful and the snow so deep that it seemed all but certain to be remembered as a blizzard. ''We are talking about a technical definition,'' said Jeff Tongue, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service at Brookhaven, N.Y. While meteorologists and public officials called the timing fortunate, coming over the weekend when millions of residents had no need to commute to work and school, the storm nonetheless caused major disruptions across the New York region. Cutting visibility sharply and rendering travel treacherous or impossible, the storm shut down Kennedy International, La Guardia and Newark Liberty International Airports in the metropolitan area, and Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington. It also forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights into and out of the Northeast, and delayed thousands more flights from airports in Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore and other cities. Thousands of travelers were stranded for much of the day at airports, but by 7:30 p.m. the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the metropolitan area airports, said that Newark Liberty and Kennedy International Airports had reopened to limited flights, while La Guardia remained closed. At 9:20 p.m., a Turkish Airways flight skidded off a runway at Kennedy Airport, but none of the 198 passengers was hurt, a Port Authority spokesman said. The Long Island Rail Road canceled service into and out of Pennsylvania Station and on the Hempstead and Port Washington lines during the day, and Metro-North service to the northern suburbs and Connecticut was curtailed, as diesel trains replaced electric ones, but there were relatively few travelers. New Jersey Transit suspended all bus service statewide for several hours but resumed it late in the day, and Amtrak reported a few cancellations and delays but said most trains remained in service along the Northeast Corridor. Today, Metro North planned for single local trains with extra cars to replace local and express trains that are scheduled within 10 or 15 minutes of each other, and the Long Island Rail Road advised riders to expect cancellations, combined trains and 30-minute delays . New York City buses continued to run, with delays that varied with the snowiness of the route, and even some of New York City's diehard subway lines experienced service disruptions, especially those that run on outdoor tracks. In the city, buses and subways were expected to be run on or close to schedule this morning. Highways across the region were perilous, with whiteout conditions. Slick roads caused hundreds of traffic accidents, but there were no reports of deaths or serious injuries. Thousands of snowplows struggled to keep major highways open, and managed to clear the main arteries of New York, though many side streets remained choked with snow. ''Make no mistake about it: this is a very dangerous big storm,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at a news conference.. But the mayor said plows would work around the clock; the goal was to have all the main arteries open and every street plowed at least once by this morning's rush. He noted, though, that highway travel would be slow at best, and urged drivers to leave cars at home, if possible. The mayor also said that public schools would be open today. Private and parochial schools generally follow the lead of public schools. Districts throughout Massachusetts, including Boston, and Rhode Island canceled school for today. The storm knocked down electrical lines and disrupted power to more than 220,000 homes, most of them in the Washington-Baltimore area. More than 85,000 customers were reported blacked out in Maryland, and 60,000 more in Virginia. Thousands more were temporarily without power in Delaware, and isolated sections of New Jersey and Long Island. But despite the storm's ferocity, there were no power failures in New York City or Westchester County, Con Edison officials said, and utilities in New Jersey and Connecticut experienced disruptions that were relatively minor for a storm of this size. The reason: Temperatures in the mid-20's made the snow light and fluffy, not heavy with moisture, so it was blown off trees by winds and did not break off limbs and knock down power lines. Broadway theaters remained open, as did most movie theaters, but many restaurants and other small businesses closed for the day, and traffic at suburban malls fell off sharply as people stayed home to ride out, and to enjoy, the storm. For millions, it was a kind of midwinter holiday, a day to frolic in the drifts, to take to the hills on sleds and toboggans, or -- for the sheer pleasure of the labor -- to attack snow-covered driveways and sidewalks with shovels and blowers. In Massapequa, N.Y., Paul Riedman had the blower and his wife, Joan, had the shovel. ''It's not really a bonding thing, doing this,'' he said. ''Teamwork by necessity,'' she called it. ''But we think it's good exercise, right?'' he said, getting in the last word. The season's most popular sledding device is a something that looks like a beach toy -- an inflatable plastic donut with a liner on the bottom of the hole. ''These tubes are all the rage,'' said Mellissa Green, 39, of Brooklyn, who found her two young children after bedtime staring out the window at the snow. ''This is something I dreamed of,'' Michael Breen, 49, said as he paused on his cross country ski trek down Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn. ''I was able to put my skis on right outside the door. It's great!'' A few blocks away, Ralk Kanitz, 31, a law student, was jogging through the snow. How was it? ''It's actually great,'' he said, looking about at a white world of drifted streets and snowy rooftops, of buried cars under aerodynamic shapes and trees cast in silhouette. ''It looks like I'm running in a wilderness.'' Central Park was a setting from a storybook. Children dragging parents dragging snowboards and sleds converged on all sides in a daylong migration. Large dogs galloped through the drifted meadows of the Great Lawn, and cross-country skiers glided among joggers gallomping in snowshoes. For many indoors, it was a day to relax by a window, perhaps with a glass of wine and soft jazz on the radio, and take in the unreal loveliness of winter -- the panes frosted like glass from Murano, the sills drifted with flourishes of lacework, and, out in the storm, dreamscapes of snow blowing down a street, curtains of snow falling in great sweeps, snow settling like peace in the parks and skeletal woodlands. In an otherwise anemic winter filled with too many sunny days and too many clich√©s about spring, the storm elicited something more-or-less poetic from its admirers. ''This is one of the best snows I've ever seen,'' said Carlos Rivera of North Bergen, N.J., who took his daughter and four cousins on their first sledding expedition of the year. ''After having 50- and 60-degree days, it's nice to see winter,'' Philip Barone of West New York, N.J., said as he and a friend took photographs. Katie Karlovitz of Weehawken put it this way: ''Being out here in the peace and quiet is the best antidote to living here all the other times.'' And in West Hartford, Conn., Mack Reynolds subjected the storm to another test: catching snowflakes on his tongue. With a wool Washington Redskins cap pulled low over his forehead, the 5-year-old grinned and nodded that yes, he had found one that tasted like sugar. A RECORD SNOWFALL: OVERVIEW"
"The snowstorm started slow and wet, and as the night and the next day wore on, it did a lot of things -- it paused, it got stronger, it got weaker, it got stronger again. But one thing it didn't do, for 24 hours, was stop. It made its point in fits and starts, trading brief lulls for blinding whiteouts in minutes. It arrived late Saturday, and by the time most people woke up yesterday morning, the city was already cloaked in white. But the storm had barely begun. At times, it was impossible to see just one block, while at other moments the air cleared, revealing postcard-perfect street scenes. Fortunately, the storm did not come on a workday and the subways kept running, so getting around was less of a headache than in previous record-setting snowfalls. For most of the day, the storm provided a rare chance to see what New York is like when it is forced to settle down, take a deep breath and go suddenly quiet. ''It's so lovely,'' said Evan Stalk, 53, who lives in Kensington, Brooklyn. ''It's muffled and wonderful.'' With the rush of cars brought to a halt, the main roads were transformed into pedestrian thoroughfares. It felt like a window into New York of the 1800's, updated with digital cameras to capture the moment. A mother in Harlem pulling her youngest son on a sled so they could make it to church on time. Three workers at a bodega playfully arguing about whose turn it was to shovel. A child pushing on a tree, being hit on the head with falling snow, and then wondering how it happened. Tom Mulligan went out during the height of the storm, about 10 a.m., when Central Park was mostly quiet. He stood alone, knee deep in snow, staring up at the trees. ''Look up there,'' he said. Perched high on a snow-covered branch was one of the red-tailed hawks that call New York City home. ''It is just so beautiful,'' he said. ''It is amazing to have everything quiet.'' There were the acts of selflessness that come with shared discomfort and the irritation at thoughtless acts like shoveling the snow from one's own stoop and piling it in front of another. But the sheer amount of snow, the fact that this was a ''once-in-a-lifetime,'' 100-year record breaker of a storm did not sink in until late in the day. And even then some thought that previous storms had been worse. The National Weather Service said the storm was most likely not a true blizzard in New York City. It simply did not behave properly. Remember those fits and starts? The wind in a blizzard must stay above 35 miles per hour for three hours straight. This storm was too fickle, the experts said. But for those in its path, it still felt like a blizzard. In the early morning, the wind whipped so fiercely and the haze of white was so blinding that many of the children who would normally storm the parks to play in the snow were forced to wait. In Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, boys and girls could be seen with their noses to the window, looking longingly outside. Hundreds of airline flights were canceled and thousands of travelers were stranded -- with many undoubtedly enduring serious hardship -- but for many New Yorkers it simply made a lazy Sunday all that much more lazy. Steve Kent, 57, strapped on a pair of cross-country skis and glided down Park Avenue. The cars that would normally make that impossible were unrecognizable white heaps on the side of the road. ''The snow is going to end soon,'' Mr. Kent said. ''I am going to make the most of it.'' It was the first time that Mina Choi, 19 months old, had ever seen snow, said her father, Daniel Choi, 33. ''She is wondering what that stuff is,'' Mr. Choi said. ''It's a good thing to introduce her to the elements.'' As the day wore on, there were signs of impatience. City Hall issued a statement at 3:30 p.m. saying the Sanitation Department would not take complaints about snow and ice on the streets and sidewalks until two hours after the last flake fell. That moment came at dusk, by which time the city seemed to be functioning remarkably well. By evening, anyone who had anything that would slide, from fancy store-bought sleds to homemade creations, found their way onto the snow. And when it snows this much, New Yorkers head to the meadow, Sheep Meadow, to build more than just snowmen. Ben Stein, 27, who lives in the East Village, was building a dragon's tail to compete with the other sculptures. His was already 10 feet tall. ''If the other ones get too big,'' he said, ''we'll destroy them.'' The strength of the storm could also be measured by the size of the dogs that were out. This was a day for the big dogs. And they don't get much bigger than the Leonberger, Bogard, that Mandy Delbridge, 28, brought out to play in Central Park. ''He is right at home in this,'' Ms. Delbridge said. ''Not like us.'' Bita Amiri's little Chihuahua mix, Lola, was not faring quite as well, looking as if she could get easily blown away and buried. ''We keep very good track of her,'' she said, laughing, noting that the dog's blue jacket was easy to spot. Outside of the parks, on the streets, the snow had already begun to turn to a slushy muddle. Most people competed to walk the path more shoveled. But they generally did so with good cheer. On one Midtown corner, a stranger reached out his hand to steady a woman who had made the unwise choice to wear high heels. And at the corner of 43rd Street and Eighth Avenue, a group of men on foot rushed to the aid of a limousine stuck in the snow and pushed it free. Even Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly noted how bad weather seems to bring out our better angels. There were no homicides reported from Saturday afternoon to yesterday evening, compared with six during the same time period the previous week. ''People talk to each other on the street when it's snowing,'' he said. ''It's a dynamic that's hard to define, but it's out there.'' He added, ''I'd take at least six months of heavy snow every year. Or at least heavy rain.'' He was joking. Mostly. A RECORD SNOWFALL: THE SCENE"
"If a giant snowstorm is a kind of invasion, it makes sense that the official response yesterday had the scale -- if not the gravity -- of a military mobilization, with commanders in headquarters deciding tactics and dispatching people and vehicles by the thousands. Alongside the government forces, battalions of businesses and millions of civilians also fought the whipping, drifting snow, many armed with nothing more imposing than shovels and snow tires. From railroad workers clearing tracks with brooms and jet engines, to suburbanites hoping only to conquer their driveways, they made up a vast, intricate machinery, struggling not just to endure, but to prevail. From all those quarters came the sense that the New York region got lucky. Not the people stuck in disabled trains and in cars windshield-deep in snowbanks, of course, nor the merchants hunkered down on what should have been a busy shopping day. And, true, the wind made it all a bit nastier. But if you have to endure a record snowfall, there are ways it can turn out to hurt less: Have your near-blizzard on a weekend, mostly overnight and in the morning, when fewer people are out. Have it taper off with some daylight hours left for cleanup. Have it in the latter part of a mild winter, when your little-used equipment is in fine shape and your salt mounds are high. Oh, and be sure to get days of warning from forecasters who, for once, aren't exaggerating when they say things like ''storm of the century.'' ''This is a good storm for us,'' said the New York City sanitation commissioner, John J. Doherty. ''It's coming at a time when we have the ability, if people stay home, to get out there and plow the streets through the day and through the night.'' The city threw impressive resources at the task of clearing the 6,300 miles of city streets -- more than enough to stretch from coast to coast and back again. It deployed 2,200 sanitation trucks rigged as snow plows, 76 Department of Transportation plows, and 350 salt spreaders that doubled as plows and dropped more than 50,000 tons of salt. It also put 2,500 sanitation workers on 12-hour shifts and canceled vacation and personal days; hired temporary workers to shovel bus stops and crosswalks; added a fifth man to each Fire Department engine; and sent 25 front-end loaders and 30 dump trucks to scoop up snow and cart it away. ''The Sanitation Department was able to keep ahead of the problem all overnight, until about six o'clock this morning,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at a news conference at a salt storage center in the West Village. ''When the heaviest snow started falling, they really pulled a lot of the plows back from the secondary and tertiary streets to focus on the main streets. And that is the main priority, because you have to be able to get the emergency service vehicles into the neighborhoods.'' By mid-afternoon, the department had changed tactics again and resumed clearing the side streets. Remarkably, the streets remained passable enough that New York City Transit buses kept running all day -- albeit with many delays and detours. Anticipating the storm, airlines canceled hundreds of flights and, on Saturday, moved hundreds of jets that would ordinarily spend the night at airports around the Northeast, flying them without passengers to regions with better weather. ''You don't want to end up in a situation where you've got airplanes out in the open, sitting on the ground with two feet of snow on the wings,'' said David Messing, a spokesman for Continental Airlines, which has a hub at Newark Liberty International Airport. A similar maneuver was tried on Long Island at All Star Mazda in Hempstead: the staff moved cars from the outdoor lot into the shop -- but only about half would fit. ''I'm watching the rest of them still out there, getting buried in snow,'' said Lenny Lucarello, the sales manager. ''We'll have to come in early tomorrow, use a power washer that sprays hot water over the cars. Between that and plowing the lot and moving the other cars back outside, it'll take us at least half a day to get up and running.'' In Hoboken, N.J., using just his hands, Jose Gonzalez dug his 1992 Buick Skylark out from under more than a foot of snow at 4 a.m. yesterday, to give his wife, Margarita, a ride to her job at a Pathmark supermarket in Edgewater. But he neglected to buy a snow shovel while he was there, and before picking up his wife at noon he again had to clear the snow from his car with his hands. ''When I got back home this morning I thought, 'How stupid can I be?' '' Mr. Gonzalez said. ''A storm like this makes me not think right.'' The region's commuter railroads had their share of problems yesterday, but were able to work around most of them, in part by taking advantage of the light weekend schedule. They hoped to have near-normal service today. At Jamaica, Queens, where several lines of the Long Island Rail Road converge, the packed-down snow kept clogging more than 200 switches, which are short lengths of rail that slide from side to side and allow trains to change tracks. Gas-burning heaters are supposed to keep the switches clear, but wind kept blowing out the flames. So through Saturday night and all day yesterday, a small army of railroad workers trudged out onto the tracks with brooms, to sweep out the switches, and then relighted the gas jets. ''We staffed up starting yesterday, to have our antifreeze trains to spray an alcohol solution on the third rail to prevent snow and ice buildup,'' said Brian Dolan, a railroad vice president. Along with other executives, he spent Saturday night in the Jamaica headquarters rather than risk a dicey commute. Before the snow began, railroad mechanics changed the ''shoes'' that connect cars to the third rail, substituting more robust ones that can scrape away snow. Despite all the effort, by midday yesterday a few trains had stalled in snow drifts in Queens, shutting much of the railroad for several hours. New Jersey Transit stopped bus service statewide from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. and canceled some of its trains as well. ''We've been running ice-breaker trains, with a device that glides along the overhead power line to break the ice off it, and we've got a couple of vehicles with jet engines that we use in the yards to melt the ice and blow the snow,'' said Dan Stessel, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit. And like officials at other transit networks around the region, he said it was fortunate that the storm hit on the weekend, when most of the trains are not in use. ''When you expose mechanical equipment to conditions like this, you increase the risk of breakdowns, because the snow gets into the air intakes, the electrical components,'' he said. ''The less you run today, the better shape it's in tomorrow.'' A RECORD SNOWFALL: THE CLEANUP"
"Manmade snow allowed the Turin Olympics to proceed as scheduled last week, when bright sun, blue skies and brown bare spots defined the Alpine scenery in Sauze d'Oulx, Italy. When some of the real thing finally fell from the skies yesterday, the Olympics ground to a halt. With nearly a foot of snow blanketing the mountain competition sites, Olympic transport slowed to a crawl and spectators waited in vain for events to begin. Last night's scheduled preliminaries in the women's aerials were postponed until tomorrow. The women's super-G was postponed until today. MIXED FORTUNES FOR U.S. CURLERS -- The United States men's curling team had last night off after wrapping up a spot in the medal round in the morning. The United States beat Britain, 9-8, and Finland beat Italy, 7-4, moments later. That meant Finland, the United States and Britain were all 6-2, and only Canada could catch them. The United States women's curling team was eliminated from medal contention when Canada beat Italy, 11-4, leaving no room for the Americans in the semifinals. CZECH REPUBLIC FIRES COACH -- The Czech Republic fired its cross-country coach, Kvetoslav Zalcik, after he inadvertently submitted the wrong name for the final leg of the men's Olympic 40-kilometer relay race. Zalcik accidentally wrote in the sprint specialist Dusan Kozisek instead of Milan Sperl for the fourth and final leg. Kozisek, who does not normally ski distance events, arrived at the course about 30 minutes after the relay started. The Czechs were in third place after the third leg but finished ninth after Kozisek raced the final leg of the relay. GERMANS WIN BOBSLED -- Andre Lange and the brakeman Kevin Kuske of Germany won the gold medal in the two-man bobsled competition, finishing ahead of Canada's Pierre Lueders and his brakeman, Lascelles Brown. Switzerland captured bronze. The United States team of Todd Hays and Pavle Jovanovic finished seventh. 2006 OLYMPIC WINTER GAMES: NOTEBOOK"
"Having endured the big snow, 26.9 inches in 24 hours, New York endured something yesterday that created fresh headaches: the big melt. That was why pedestrians crossing the street had to do the long jump at the corner. On a day when the temperature climbed as much as nine degrees above freezing, puddles loomed like lakes. It was why blocks of snow the size of Ping-Pong tables broke free and sailed off rooftops, creating instant snow flurries, unless they landed on someone, creating an instant snowman. It was why street-level streams beneath elevated subways in Queens were fed by a daylong drizzle from the tracks and platforms. It was why cars seemed to spray a slushy, mucky mess wherever they went, and why people who just wanted to have one last snowball fight -- and wanted to have it on the street -- were splashed and splattered by buses whose drivers just wanted to keep to their schedules. ''It's disgusting,'' said Renee Young, a publicist in Manhattan. ''Water is pouring off the buildings, so if you walk too close to the buildings, you get drenched.'' And then there was what was underfoot, an unpredictable and potentially slippery coating on the pavement. ''You have to concentrate,'' said Evelyn Gatzonis, who owns a spa in Astoria, Queens, and walked to work in leather boots with 4 1/2-inch stiletto heels. (It was Valentine's Day, after all, she said.) There was a lot to concentrate on: avoiding potholes in the making, and avoiding the sludgy, brackish liquid that had already filled them. ''It's like a strawberry daiquiri that's been out for five minutes and the stuff has started to separate so the syrup's on the bottom and ice is on the top,'' said Adele Morrissette, an investment banker whose office is in Rockefeller Center. ''In this case, the syrup you don't want to know. The streets weren't clean before it snowed.'' There will probably be more syrup today, as the forecast calls for the temperature in Manhattan to rise to 52 degrees, and more grumbling. Gladis Wallace of the Bronx said she loved a good snowstorm, ''but the aftermath is a bit much.'' ''You've got big puddles of ice-cold melted snow,'' Ms. Wallace said. ''You've got to jump over them. I've been trying to find a way around them without having to step into a puddle that's past your ankle.'' For all the inconvenience, city officials said they did not expect the melting snow to be a burden to the sewer system. Sometimes sewer water is forced to bypass the city's 14 treatment plants after heavy rains. The treatment plants can handle 1.2 billion gallons of water a day. Charles G. Sturcken, a spokesman for the city's Department of Environmental Protection, posited that when melted, a foot of snow equals an inch of rain. ''So this is really like three inches of rain,'' he said. ''The sewers should be able to handle this. Had we gotten rain at 51 degrees, between the melt and the rain, you'd fill up the system and go overboard. But this looks like an easy melt.'' Not on the street, where the big melt changed the routines of those trying to get around. ''On Day 1, it was a mountain-climbing thing,'' said Lisa Kovitz, who commutes to Manhattan from Ossining, N.Y. ''You have to step in the footprints of the other person. ''By Day 2, someone has taken some sort of sharp object and cut the Khyber Pass in the mountain,'' she continued, ''but at the other end of the Khyber Pass is the lake.'' Ms. Morrissette, the investment banker, encountered a lake on the way to work, in ankle-high hiking boots, and water seeped in through the eyelets. For the rest of the day, she alternated between the sunny side of the street, with puddles, and the shady side, where the walkways were narrower because there was more snow. Judith Altreuter, the production director of the Modern Language Association in Manhattan, had the reason behind the lake problem figured out. ''Why don't they shovel the drains?'' she asked. ''It's so obvious that's the reason. The people who shovel, how hard would it be for them to learn where the drains were? In 25 years of living in New York, I've seen no advance on this learning curve.'' But Keith Mellis, a spokesman for the Sanitation Department, said workers were paying attention to the drains, which his agency calls catch basins. ''They need to be clear,'' he said. ''We're out there clearing them. We're getting the bulk of the snow out of the way, but when Mother Nature helps us even more with warmer weather, we want to make sure the catch basins are able to receive the receding water.'' People who did not excavate their cars on Monday faced a double headache yesterday: snow and water. Larry Flowers, who repairs and installs windows, discovered that to clear off his Ford Expedition he had to stand in a river of sludgy melted snow. ''It's sloppy,'' he said of East 162nd Street in the Bronx, near Teller Avenue, where his sport utility vehicle was parked. The city, which suspended alternate-side parking regulations yesterday and today, said the rules would be reinstated tomorrow. But parking meters will be in operation today."
"HAD he not become entranced with the idea of running a water park, Ken Leavitt would not be where he is today: checking the weather like a doctor monitoring a patient's vital signs, praying for snow, sounding like someone who has come to realize that an M.B.A. and a master's in international management are entirely insufficient training for the ultimate business challenge -- running a mom and pop ski center during this bipolar winter. But at least he's still in business, a week after balmy winter weather forced him to shut down the Powder Ridge ski area in central Connecticut and lay off its 300 employees. Three days later, last weekend's storm allowed him to turn on a dime and open it back up. ''What was it that John Lennon said, 'Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans?' '' Mr. Leavitt said in the blessed chill of his reopened ski center on Monday night, as snowblowers blasted out geysers of frigid mist. ''Before this, I co-founded a high-tech company that grew to $20 million in international sales in five years, and that was much easier than operating a ski area. Much easier.'' Mr. Leavitt's circuitous path to Alpine economics began after he and his brother sold their high-tech company, CGX Corporation, and he was on vacation with his family in Florida. Visiting Disney World in 1986, they realized everyone had more fun at half the price at a nearby water park, Wet 'n Wild. Soon he was traveling the country visiting water parks -- he has since gone to 90 or so -- with the idea of creating a natural park that is less towers and slides and more a natural attraction for a family outing built into a mountain. Eventually, he settled on a promising site in central Connecticut on the grounds of a beloved local ski area that the Zemel brothers, Herman and Louis, had started in 1959. With attractive demographics -- more people in a 15-mile radius than in the entire state of Vermont -- he figured he could run it as a ski center in the winter and a water park in the summer. And then things began to go awry. There was community opposition to building the water park and he was not prepared for the myriad complications of the process of getting permits. Ten years after buying the 300-acre property, less than 100 of it used for skiing, it's still just a ski area, though he finally has the approval to build the water park and is considering building houses as well. Still, in a good year, the ski area works -- as does his family. His wife and two daughters help run the place. Powder Ridge isn't like Killington or Stowe in Vermont. Its vertical drop is 500 feet, compared with 3,050 at Killington, and its annual attendance of 100,000 doesn't compare with the big boys with higher hills and better snow farther north. But that is also its appeal, and Powder Ridge, particularly on weekdays, functions as a local ski center in the best sense, where kids go after school, the Glastonbury Special Olympics ski team comes to practice, where high school students from Durham, Middletown or Middlefield sell hot dogs one day and snowboard the next. IN fact, that's part of what allowed him to reopen. He called it quits after the warmest January in history, when rain washed away the snow and strips of grass surfaced on the mountain. He said at the time it would take a foot of snow or more for him to reopen. When he got 18 inches last weekend, local officials and loyal customers formed a phone tree to get in touch with employees and season-ticket holders, and then many of them decided to fill in as workers for no pay. So on Monday the help included Bonny Fowler and Karen Fowler, sisters-in-law married to a chiropractor and an engineer, who bused tables, while Bonny Fowler's 9-year old son, Luke, skied with a friend. Aside from running a business, Mr. Leavitt's experience thus far has allowed him to formulate Leavitt's First Principal of Thermodynamics, which states that there is a correlation between the costly production of man-made snow and the certainty of rain, a formulation which may be proved again later in the week, with more rain predicted. Still, the weekend is supposed to be frigid, and if it stays cold for much of the busy week including Washington's birthday, the year could turn out to be reasonably productive after all. Mr. Leavitt snowboards and skis, but asked if he was one of those people imbued with the spirit of winter, who lives for each frigid moment on the slopes, he shrugged. ''I'd take the Caribbean any time,'' he said. Our Towns E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com"
"Three months after the devastating earthquake leveled every house in this mountain village in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, the newlyweds Zaheer and Shazia found themselves sleeping once more in the open, this time in the snow. Their cotton tent had collapsed on top of them in the night under a heavy snowfall, so for four nights, they huddled in the open on a rope bed by a fire. ''It was very cold, the snow fell on our faces,'' said Shazia, 19, with a shy smile. ''We need a shelter, food rations and bedding.'' Despite an enormous aid effort over the three months since the Oct. 8 earthquake, rescue workers are still finding new villages in need of the most basic assistance to hope to survive the harsh winter snows. Two heavy snowfalls in the last month have hampered the relief operation and tested the population of this mountainous area, still traumatized by the quake, which killed 73,338 people, seriously injured 69,000 and left an estimated 2.5 million homeless. ''We are very worried and are being very vigilant,'' said Jan Vandemoortele, coordinator chief of the United Nations mission in Pakistan, which is working with the Pakistani government in the relief effort. A long spell of very cold weather could imperil many lives, he said. ''We are aware that the weather could blow us off in a day,'' he said. ''We cannot let our heads rest until the spring.'' Only a tiny proportion of the homeless moved to unaffected cities to rent accommodations or stay with relatives. Nearly 2 million are living in tents in the valleys and can expect two more months of freezing temperatures, Mr. Vandemoortele said, while some 400,000 people remain above the snowline, cut off by snow and landslides and surviving on airlifts of food and other supplies. Of the 860,000 tents distributed in the rush after the earthquake, only 30,000 were adequate for winter conditions, said Maj. Gen. Farooq Ahmad Khan, Pakistan's federal relief commissioner. When the first snow came at the start of the year, reports flooded in of tents collapsing, and of some burning down when people tried to heat them. A second round of supplies was needed, of plastic sheeting, corrugated metal roofing and tools, to help villagers build better shelters that could be heated, he said. The cold weather has brought a rise in acute respiratory infections -- pneumonia in the worst form -- which are now the main cause of deaths recorded by health officials. Families have been struggling into the towns after desperate journeys through the snow to seek assistance after their makeshift homes or tents collapsed in the latest heavy snowfall. Yet the relief effort, now in full swing, seems to be winning against the formidable obstacles in one of the most inaccessible disaster areas aid workers have seen. Helicopters -- American Chinooks, Pakistani military aircraft and white-painted aircraft chartered by the United Nations and other organizations -- ply the skies incessantly to funnel relief supplies into the mountains. Colored tents dot the hillsides and camps spill over and around the main towns. ''Thank God, in the two bad spells of weather, there has been no panic among the 3.5 million affected,'' General Farooq said, adding into the count the many villages that survived the quake but have been cut off by landslides. The airlifts of food and shelter materials gave people the confidence that they could survive, and there has not been a large movement of people down to the towns, he said. The region has also avoided any major epidemics so far. An outbreak of cholera was quickly scotched in a camp in Muzaffarabad in November, according to Sacha Bootsma, spokeswoman for the World Health Organization in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. The increase in acute respiratory infections, which amount to 30 percent of all medical consultations, she described as ''definitely a concern,'' but so far there had been no health catastrophe. Teams of Cuban and Pakistani doctors are trekking and flying into remote villages. The first priority in the relief effort was to supply those stranded at higher elevations before the winter closed in, but aid workers are still finding families and whole villages that have not received any aid. Shawn Pomeroy, a Canadian mountain climber working for the International Organization for Migration, which has overall responsibility for the shelter program, made the six-hour hike up from the town of Muzaffarabad last week and found the surviving villagers of Qaziabad, 6,000 feet above sea level, camping out. ''They had not received anything to date,'' he said. ''We are still filling pockets that missed out in the distribution.'' He found more than 400 families in Qaziabad, surviving with cotton tents they had collected from the town below. Some had plastic sheeting to put over the tents, but the village had not received a single airdrop of food or supplies, he said. The road had been cut since the earthquake, and the footpath was treacherous from continuing landslides, he said. Still, he said, the aid effort is making strides. ''It was overwhelming to begin with, the size of the disaster, but we are winning,'' he said. But for many of the inhabitants of the earthquake area, the nightmare has not abated. Their faces no longer show the shock so evident in the days immediately after the quake, but fear and uncertainty remains. Villagers in Qaziabad said 250 people had died there and in surrounding hamlets in the earthquake. ''The children wake up at night -- they are scared of being buried,'' said Rashida, mother of eight, as she tended a fire in the tiny mud hut her husband had fashioned from the rubble of their home. Her 12-year-old daughter, Maria, who was buried in the rubble of her school by the earthquake but was pulled out unharmed, sat silently beside her. Her 12-year-old son, Talbir, said, ''I am scared to sleep in a tent and scared to sleep inside.'' Farther west in the town of Balakot, which was severely damaged in the earthquake, several families a day have been trickling in after trekking down from remote snowbound Kaghan Valley. ''We had so many difficulties, and then we had this snowfall,'' said Muhammad Asif, 21, who arrived a week ago with his wife, parents and brothers. They took turns carrying his two Asif boys, 2 and 4, for two days through knee-deep snow. ''We had no tent, just a tarpaulin,'' he said. ''My plan was to stay up there, but the snow was too much.'' ''I am frightened of the mountain,'' he added. ''When the snow started, the landslides started again, so we came here,'' said his mother, Bibi Sarwar Jan. ''The helicopters stopped also with the snow, and we had no more food.'' Many of the mountainsides are still unstable, and landslides have worsened with the recent snow and rain, villagers and aid officials said. Roads cleared by the Pakistani Army in the last two months have been blocked again, and supply trucks have not been able to get more than a few miles outside the main towns. Sajjad, 27, walked five hours from his village, Nuri, in the Kaghan Valley, with his four young children, his wife carrying the youngest, 2 1/2-month-old Waqas. He had built a wooden shack and covered it with plastic after the quake, but it had collapsed on the family one morning after a heavy snowfall. They are also running low on food, he said. ''No helicopters came to our village,'' he said. ''We were living on our own food supplies. Helicopters landed at a nearby village, but the villagers there would push us away.'' Worst of all, the land was unstable, he said. ''Now there is a big danger of another landslide, and our land is threatened,'' he said. ''Lots of boulders are coming down, especially when it rains or snows.'' On a warm, sunny day in Balakot, life can seem just bearable. Survivors of the quake are out picking over the rubble of their houses, breaking up concrete and salvaging wood and scrap metal. But when the weather turns, as it did one recent evening, and wind and rain start to lash the tented camps and the acres of rubble, the misery of life in the disaster zone is all too clear. Ignoring the rain, Muhammad Owais Khan, 19, who lost his mother, father, younger brother, grandmother, aunt and his 10-year-old cousin when their house collapsed that October morning, stood looking through a family photo album he had just found in the wreckage of his home. ''That's my father on his wedding day,'' he said, pointing to a man in a white suit, garlands of tinsel around his neck. ''And that's my mother,'' he said, flicking to a page of a woman in gold ornaments and red silk veil. He had also just found the family Koran in the rubble, and had wrapped it carefully and stowed it with other belongings in a tent he had set up. Then he carried over parts of a smashed washing machine. ''I feel very bad,'' he said in English, looking around at the destruction. The government had given every family $438, but it was not even enough to remove the first layer of concrete from the wreckage of his home, he said. ''Five thousand people lived up on this hill, and 70 percent were killed,'' he said. They had pulled his 6-month-old cousin from his dead mother's arms, after hearing him cry for two days, he said. His three sisters and uncle survived and are living together in rented accommodations in the nearby town of Mansehra, he said. They could never live again on the hilltop, but would rebuild on land below, he said. ''We will come back after this crushing blow,'' he said. ''We will come back. My parents are buried here.''"
"The roof of an ice-skating rink collapsed on Monday afternoon after a heavy snowfall in Bad Reichenhall, a resort in southern Germany. The collapse killed at least 10 people, a spokesman for the town council, Christoph Abriss, said early Tuesday, The Associated Press reported. The dead included two children, German television reported, citing local police officials. The chief of police in Traunstein, near Bad Reichenhall, said on television that some people were missing and were feared trapped. The chief, Fritz Braun, said no sounds were coming from the building, which rescue workers found difficult to enter because of the risk that the roof could collapse further. By early Tuesday, six of the dead had been removed and four other bodies had been located, Mr. Abriss said. The police said that with temperatures falling below 20 degrees, the greatest danger to anyone still trapped was the cold. With most schools off for the week, many Germans and Austrians were on vacation, and Bad Reichenhall, about two and a half hours southeast of Munich, is a popular sports destination in Bavaria. The collapse occurred only minutes before the rink's normal closing time of 4 p.m. on Monday. Two people were also killed in an avalanche earlier on Monday that struck in the mountains near Bad Reichenhall. One person was missing, and the search for him was hampered by the heavy snow, which grounded rescue helicopters. The continuing snowfall made it difficult for rescue workers, some from nearby Salzburg, Austria, to reach the skating rink. The German Automobile Association reported heavy traffic jams on the main road leading from Munich to the mountain area, while many smaller roads were impassable. Even so, by early in the evening some 700 rescue workers were on the scene. German television showed a heavy crane being trucked to the site in an effort to lift away portions of the collapsed roof, which was illuminated by searchlights. Dozens of Red Cross workers and firemen could be seen, some leading dogs trained to search for people buried in snow. Other workers tried to prop up portions of the building. According to Chief Braun, speaking in a television interview, a local youth ice hockey team that was due to practice at the rink late Monday afternoon was told not to come, so workers could sweep the snow from the roof as a precautionary measure. Local reports said 12 inches of snow had fallen overnight. But he said the snow on the roof had been measured earlier in the day and was not deemed to be a risk, so the normal closing hour of 4 p.m. was not changed. Chief Braun said the snowfall was not unusual, and speculated that a structural fault in the building rather than the snow might have been the cause of the collapse. He said the national police would begin a criminal investigation."
"After clambering out a second-story window on Saturday, Kimie Kuwahara, 80, stood atop the 10-foot-high wall of snow surrounding her house. She surveyed this region called the snow country -- the starkly white mountain range that spread out in the distance behind her, the record snowfall that had blanketed all but the triangle-shaped roofs in her neighborhood. Pushing a plowlike shovel with both hands, Ms. Kuwahara was busy clearing the fresh powder to a recessed pile several feet away under which, she swore, lay a pond with carp. Her husband, Naoji, also 80, had climbed a ladder onto the roof, where he deftly plied his shovel to send chunks tumbling down. ''It's a never-ending job!'' said Ms. Kuwahara, who had left a ''village on the other side of the mountain'' to come to this town as a bride a half-century ago. ''After you've cleared the snow, the place is covered with snow again two days later.'' Smiling from ear to ear, Ms. Kuwahara, who maintained that snow-clearing had kept her the ''fittest person in the neighborhood,'' said cheerfully: ''Ah! The snow country! What can you do?'' The snow country, ensconced between the Sea of Japan and the Japanese Alps, is one of the world's snowiest regions and typically lies under a dozen feet of snow for several months a year. But the coldest winter in decades has brought record snowfalls to the region in recent weeks. The snow has buried cars and houses and trifled with Japan's famed bullet trains. It has flanked plowed streets with 10-foot-high walls of snow and transformed towns into white labyrinths inside which human beings scurry as if they were mice. One of the hardest-hit areas, the town of Tsunan here in Niigata Prefecture, lay under nearly 13 feet of snow in recent days. Old-timers say it is the heaviest snowfall since 1945, a year remembered here as much as for its 23 feet of snow as for the end of World War II. To Seiji Kuwabara, 69, a neighbor of the Kuwaharas', life here in the snow country means ''to endure.'' Yet this winter's snow has revealed both the region's hardiness and fragility. In a region depleted of young people, like other rural areas in a rapidly graying country, septuagenarians and octogenarians have been toiling to save their roofs from collapsing and their homes from being entombed -- the husbands typically going up on the roof, with the wives staying below. Nearly 70 people nationwide, most of them older, have succumbed to the winter. In this town, where a third of the population is over age 65, an 81-year-old man clearing snow died after falling into a river; another man, in his late 70's, was buried by snow that fell off a roof. Snowbound and enveloped in dim light for months, the snow country is part of the less developed ''backside of Japan,'' as it is called, in contrast to its ''front side,'' which faces the Pacific. Yasunari Kawabata, in his novel ''Snow Country,'' chose this region's gloomy atmosphere as the setting for a doomed love affair at a hot spring in Yuzawa, not far from here. Until the advent of regular snow removal in the 1960's, roads became impassable to cars, and walking to Tokamachi, less than 10 miles away, took five hours. The snow was piled so high that people were forced to climb out of their homes. Shigeno Tamura, the owner of the Takaraya pork-cutlet restaurant, most vividly remembered seeing the boots of pedestrians at the top of her house's ground-floor windows. Still, not all the memories are of hardship. ''When we were young, we played by playing jump-rope over power lines,'' recalled Fumi Kazamaki, 66, who was shoveling the snow in front of her house as her husband, Michio, 65, labored, naturally, on the roof. ''We lived by using the positive aspects of snow,'' she said, adding that the snow bound the community together. Children nowadays stay indoors when it snows to play video games, she said, but in the past they made igloos. ''I remember the light of the candle inside the igloo. It was like a fairy tale.'' ''We lived in the snow itself in those days,'' she added. ''Now we live by conquering the snow.'' The snow country, or this corner of it at least, began conquering the snow in the late 1960's. Sprinklers were installed in the middle of streets, the first one here in 1972; electrical pumps nowadays send mild underground water to melt the snow all over Tsunan. Some streets, especially those near the train station, are heated. Snowplows clear the roads for the town's 12,000 residents, thanks to the $1 million the town spends on snow removal from its annual $50 million budget. ''These days we can walk outside in ordinary shoes,'' said Takaaki Takahashi, who was leading the snow removal efforts for the town office. Around the same time the battle against the snow began, Kakuei Tanaka, one of postwar Japan's most powerful prime ministers and a native of this region, brought highways and other huge public works projects here. Thanks to Mr. Tanaka, who was later forced from office because of the bribery scandal involving the Lockheed Corporation, even the bullet train reached this neglected region. ''People in the cities, in the front side of Japan, remember Tanaka for his corruption,'' said Fumio Kazamaki, 53, the owner of the Tomitaya Inn here. ''But we here in the backside of Japan remember him for changing our everyday lives.'' The lives were perhaps not that different any more from those on the other side of Japan, though this winter's snow was a reminder that snow could not be conquered completely. Harunobu Shiga, 74, was standing outside his house, waiting impatiently for the weekly Tsunan Newspaper. The delivery man came every Friday around 4 p.m., but it was already nearing 5 p.m. ''Maybe he's lost because of the snow,'' Mr. Shiga said, a worried look on his face. He looked with appreciation at the snow bank next to his house, built some eight decades ago when his mother, now 103, came here as a bride. Because the snow had piled up so quickly, he said, the bank did not contain the usual layers of crusted snow. ''I wonder if this will melt by April or remain until May,'' Mr. Shiga said. He preferred to look on the good side. It was thanks to the snow, he said, that the region had pure water to produce the country's best sakes and rice, Uonuma Koshihikari, of which a 22-pound bag sells for about $61. ''Maybe I shouldn't say this because of the people who are suffering right now,'' Mr. Shiga said, ''but the snow is our treasure.'' Tsunan Journal"
"The former director of the Mount Vernon Overall Development Corporation was sentenced yesterday in State Supreme Court to one to three years in state prison, prosecutors said. The former director, William Ewell, 34, of Herrels, N.C., pleaded guilty in August to grand larceny. Mr. Ewell was charged with stealing $48,563 from the agency, which disburses federal and state grant money to assist in Mount Vernon's economic development, said Janet DiFiore, the Westchester County district attorney. She said Mr. Ewell wrote checks to himself and forged the signatures of two other corporate officers. He fled to North Carolina and was arrested when he returned to Westchester in April, she said ."
"A fall storm hit parts of Colorado with as much as 25 inches of snow on Thursday, setting off avalanches and rockslides and closing roads and schools. ''It's been some time since we've had a storm of this nature, a blizzard, like this,'' said Lorne Kramer, city manager for Colorado Springs, one of the hardest-hit areas. ''Because of the advance warning, we were able to do a lot in preparation.'' The storm stretched across the state with varying intensity, hitting hardest in the southern part of the state, which experienced blizzard conditions and deep snow. Wind speeds in Colorado Springs were as high as 47 miles per hour, and temperatures there and in the Denver area were at freezing or near. While Denver only received a few inches of snow, Colorado Springs, about 60 miles to the south, was essentially shut down -- including the military bases around the city -- with snowdrifts of several feet reported in northern parts of town. Mr. Kramer said snowplows were struggling to reach some spots where wind and snow had made driving impossible. Power failures became a problem for those who had stayed home to be safe. Xcel Energy, the state's largest power provider, said over 50,000 customers lost power as trees still covered with green or fall-colored leaves became laden with snow and fell on power lines. ''One of the last things we saw on the television before the power went out was that there would be this emergency shelter,'' said Jay Tomlinson, a software engineer who came to the New Life Church's World Prayer Center in Colorado Springs where the Red Cross set up a shelter on Thursday. ''As many people as we saw stranded on the roads, there were tons of people helping them.'' Mr. Tomlinson said he woke up to a foot of snow and then watched as three more inches fell in one hour. According to the National Weather Service in Boulder, Colo., this was typical of the snowfall, which varied from 8 to 25 inches, with one to three inches per hour during the peak of the storm. Dave Barjeneruchj, a meteorologist, said the wet, heavy snow that was causing the power failures was actually a blessing to some because it was less likely to blow onto roads and reduce visibility. Dozens of flights were canceled and delayed at Denver International Airport in the morning, but its roads and runways remained open. A spokesman, Chuck Cannon, described it as ''just another snowstorm.'' The ski industry might disagree with that assessment, with some ski resorts opening earlier than ever. ''Actually, it's not unusual for us to get snowfalls at this time of year,'' said Molly Cuffe, director of communications for Colorado Ski Country U.S.A., a trade association in Denver for the state's 26 ski resorts. ''What is unusual is the amounts, and we are seeing record snowfall for the month of October.'' In Colorado, people often note how suddenly the weather can change, and this storm will be no different, with sunny skies and much warmer weather predicted for this weekend to melt away the snow. ''By Saturday, we probably won't even know we had a storm,'' Mr. Kramer said."
"An unusual early-fall snowstorm buried Buffalo and a broad swath of New York State reaching east to the Rochester suburbs late Thursday and early Friday, snarling traffic, snapping power lines and leaving almost 400,000 homes and businesses without electricity. Officials attributed three deaths to the storm. Two died in automobile accidents, and a third was struck by a falling branch. Even in Buffalo, where the ability to endure severe weather is a source of civic pride, few expected a snowstorm like this in mid-October -- including those who predict them. Don Paul, a meteorologist at WIVB-TV4 in Buffalo, has worked in the area for more than 20 years. ''Of all the events I've seen here, this storm involves the most widespread devastation in the most populated area,'' he said. ''It's absolutely an historic storm.'' According to the National Weather Service, 8.6 inches of snow fell Thursday, breaking the previous mark for the month, 6 inches, set on Oct. 31, 1917. About 14 inches fell on Friday, for a total of 22.6 inches at Buffalo Niagara International Airport. ''Our crews were wrapping up their workdays yesterday and the weather forecasters were still talking about rain,'' said Steve Brady, a spokesman for National Grid, which provides electricity to Buffalo as well as its largest suburbs. ''We've had windstorms in the fall and ice storms in the fall, but never a snowstorm like this, this early.'' After surveying the devastation from a helicopter Friday afternoon, Gov. George E. Pataki declared a state of emergency in four counties at the western end of the state. ''We know people are going to be without power for some time and presumably without heat for some time as well,'' Mr. Pataki said, noting that Mr. Brady said it could take until next weekend to restore power to nearly 400,000 homes and businesses in the region. ''It's never quick enough.'' Mr. Brady estimated that 261,000 National Grid homes and businesses -- about half of its customers -- as far east as Brockport, near Rochester, were without power. And about 125,000 customers served by New York State Electric and Gas were also without electricity as of Friday afternoon. The situation was especially severe in Buffalo, where Mayor Byron Brown said about 70 percent of the city's 285,000 residents were without electricity. Heavy wet snow started falling about 2 p.m. Thursday. Snow built up on the leaves and branches of trees, bending and breaking even the healthiest of trunks. Heightening the clash of seasons, lightning flashed through the night and loud claps of thunder mingled with the cracks and pops of trees giving way under the weight of the snow. ''It sounded like gunshots,'' said Percy Jackson, 18, who spent the day off from school shoveling sidewalks. The falling trees severed power lines, damaged cars and houses, and blocked countless streets. Besides closing area schools and most businesses, the storm disrupted schedules at area hospitals. All elective surgeries at Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo were postponed, said Cheryl Klass, president of the hospital, and staff members slept at the hospital between their 12-hour shifts. A 105-mile stretch of the New York State Thruway -- from Dunkirk northeast to Rochester -- was closed for much of the day as crews worked to clear the highway, said Sarah Kampf, a spokeswoman for the New York State Thruway Authority. ''There are some jackknifed tractor-trailers,'' Ms. Kampf said. ''Mostly, though, it just needs to be plowed.'' Many motorists were stranded along the snow-choked thruway, but personnel traveling on snowmobiles delivered food and water to them. ''Our Buffalo division was prepared for what they were reporting would fall,'' Ms. Kampf said. ''But it was quite a bit more than what was being reported.'' Despite the lack of electricity and the disruption of some phone service, Mayor Brown said order was maintained in the city. ''We have seen no spike at all in criminal activity,'' Mayor Brown said. But the warmth of the sun, which came out Friday morning, was a mixed blessing, because the mayor said the melting snow could lead to even more power failures. According to Mr. Brady, ''As the snow melts and trees start to stand back up, they can whack wires going back up in the other direction. And if the wind starts to blow pretty good, that could cause a problem for us.'' Residents and officials braced for the possibility of flooding caused by the combination of melting snow and rain that was forecast for the weekend. Temperatures are expected to stay in the 40's. Governor Pataki said it was too early to estimate how much it would cost to clear the highways and restore electricity. ''I'm not even going to think about the cost at this point,'' he said. ''The important thing is to make sure people are safe and get their lives back to normal.''"
"''I think it's letting up,'' said Eliot Spitzer, the attorney general. He pointed out the concourse window at Buffalo Niagara International Airport. ''It was coming down harder this afternoon, almost definitely.'' On Thursday night, this city was in the middle of its first snowfall of the season. It was a big one, and it coincided (same night, same city) with Mr. Spitzer's final debate against John Faso, who is running against Mr. Spitzer for governor. Mr. Spitzer may have a formidable campaign machine, but he and his staff -- about 15 were on hand -- were having some problems getting back to New York after the event. Mr. Faso, for his part, was spending the night at a motel in Buffalo, because he had plans upstate the next day. Mr. Spitzer's flight, on JetBlue, was to leave Buffalo at 10:40 p.m., but because the power had gone out at the airport in the afternoon, staff members were already placing bets on the length of a delay. His wife, Silda Wall Spitzer, raised the possibility of staying overnight more than once, and more than once it was discarded: there were no hotel rooms available near the airport. In any event, city roads were unsafe. Mr. Spitzer asked his wife to phone their daughters' baby sitter in Manhattan and ask her to get the girls ready for bed. ''But tell her we're on our way,'' he added, displaying an optimism and pragmatism that would rarely wane over a long night. ''Worst-case scenario is, the plane that's supposed to be taking us doesn't get in and they send us all out on a new flight, for which they said the crew is supposed to arrive by 1, which means we're on the plane at 1:30.'' ''Not sure I understood that, but O.K.,'' Ms. Wall Spitzer said. ''I have a lot of meetings in New York tomorrow morning,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''We'll be fine. Buffalo is good at weather.'' Mr. Spitzer's aides waited at Gate 8, while the attorney general and his wife sat alone at Gate 10. Mr. Spitzer was unable to keep still for very long, pacing toward his wife and back across the waiting area. He bought a couple of small bags of potato chips and took a laptop to a corner so he could watch a replay of his debate on the Internet. ''Faso did a good job,'' he said with the magnanimity that only a candidate with a 50-point lead in the polls could afford. ''He was a lot more comfortable up there this time than in the last debate.'' His wife, exhausted at this point, smiled and said, ''Eliot gets really hyper after these things.'' Midnight came and went, and planes remained idle. At 1:30 a.m., passengers -- including Mr. Spitzer -- were led into the snow and onto a plane. But more snow fell and kept the plane on the ground. And at 3:45 a.m., the captain announced that a bolt of lightning had taken out the airport's alternate source of power, rendering it impossible for the cockpit to communicate with the airport crew. That sent everyone back inside the airport. ''We'll get on the first flight out,'' Mr. Spitzer declared, that optimism still in place. ''Six-thirty a.m.'' Ms. Wall Spitzer took her husband's hand and gently rolled her eyes. Then came another announcement. The airport was closed until noon. But Mr. Spitzer had a plan. ''Get somebody to bring us to the Rochester airport,'' he told an aide, who contacted a member of the attorney general's staff and gave him instructions to pick up the Spitzers. The candidate and his wife, carrying a couple of polyfill blankets and pillows from the plane, wandered the airport halls until they found a reasonably secluded gate, where they were able to stretch out on two adjacent rows of seats. He took off his shoes and his suit jacket and pulled a crewneck sweater from his overnight bag, a gift from an upstate Rotary Club. The stitching on the bag had misspelled his name: ''Eliot Spitizer.'' Mr. Spitzer was able to shut his eyes. About 6:45, an S.U.V. arrived to take the entourage to Rochester. ''I slept about two hours, two and a half,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''I feel fine. Usually I get about five hours' sleep, from 12, 12:30, until 5 a.m. or so. The last night I pulled an all-nighter was a few years ago on a case. I didn't have to stay up, but a couple of guys working for me did, so, you know -- it's like law school: you stay up with the people on your team. I say 'all-nighter' even though I went home at 4 and slept for an hour. I count that as being up all night.'' As they set out for Rochester, the sun was coming up but the sky was essentially whited out by whirling clouds of snow. They tried Interstate 90, got stuck, turned around, then tried a local road, where they crossed paths with a fireman who advised them not to proceed. The S.U.V. got stuck again, so Mr. Spitzer got out to push. They tried I-90 once more and crept along at 20 miles per hour or so. Mr. Spitzer's crew came across a car that had fishtailed. He tried to push that car back onto the highway, but wasn't able to. As the group proceeded east toward Batavia, the road suddenly cleared and the sun was shining (''total lake effect,'' a campaign aide explained). The drive to Rochester -- about 60 miles -- took nearly three hours. The Spitzers managed to get standby seats on a 10:25 a.m. flight to La Guardia Airport. Rich Baum, a campaign adviser, handed the attorney general a morning newspaper, but Mr. Spitzer quickly nodded off. He dozed all the way back to New York."
"More than 100,000 homes and businesses remained without power here on Wednesday, nearly a week after a preseason snowstorm dumped almost two feet of snow and wreaked havoc on trees and power lines. Twelve deaths have been attributed to the storm, and schools are still closed. Officials say the cleanup could cost more than $30 million. And though the snow has all but melted away, frustration has been mounting among those without power as utility workers from throughout the Northeast worked to restore electricity, a task that may not be completed until Sunday, officials said. Nearly 400,000 residences and businesses initially lost power. ''The first couple of days, people are kind of cool,'' said Joel A. Giambra, the executive of Erie County, which includes Buffalo and most of the area most severely hit by the storm. ''They're helping each other and staying at each other's houses -- there's a camaraderie. But when you got to the fourth and fifth day, that coolness turns to anger and frustration, and that's where we're at now.'' Gov. George E. Pataki has asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency to declare the area a major disaster, which would make local governments and property owners eligible for federal aid to help cover storm-related costs. ''It wouldn't be responsible to put an exact number on it yet -- we just don't have enough information,'' Mr. Giambra said. ''But it's definitely going to exceed $30 million.'' More than 22 inches of heavy snow fell during a 16-hour period from late last Thursday through early Friday, according to the National Weather Service. The previous record for snowfall in a 24-hour period in October was six inches, on Oct. 31, 1917. The snow weighed down trees that had yet to shed their leaves, snapping off limbs that knocked down power lines. ''It looks like some of them have been put through a pencil sharpener,'' Sharon Webber, a horticulturist with Cornell Cooperative Extension, said of the trees. She estimated that as many as half of the Buffalo area's trees could be lost because of damage from the storm. The Catholic Health System, which has four hospitals in the region, has been unable to discharge some patients whose homes were still without power. ''There are dozens of cases like that,'' said Dennis McCarthy, a spokesman. He said the hospitals were overwhelmed with patients in the days after the storm. ''We saw lots of people with carbon monoxide problems from their generators, people hurt by falling trees and branches and getting injured trying to shovel out,'' Mr. McCarthy said. In all, Erie County officials have linked 12 deaths to the storm or its aftermath. One person was killed by a falling branch outside his home on Friday, while two others -- including an off-duty New York State trooper -- died in automobile accidents during the storm. An 87-year-old woman and her 91-year-old tenant died after being overcome by carbon monoxide from a gasoline-powered generator inside the house they shared, and another man fell down his basement stairs while on his way to relight a pilot light. The other deaths involved heart attacks or other health-related problems linked to the storm. An estimated 10 million tons of debris -- mostly fallen trees and branches -- line nearly every road. About 3,000 people are involved in the cleanup effort, including utility workers from as far away as West Virginia and equipment operators and laborers from around New York. About 300 National Guard members are also involved. Travel bans were lifted on Tuesday, but most school districts had already canceled classes for the week because of power failures and concern for getting students safely to class."
"It was sort of like the good old days as Nelson Armlin, mountain manager at the Windham Mountain ski resort in the Catskills, plowed his way toward the top of the 1,600-foot hill in a 15-ton Pisten Bully snow groomer. A blizzard pelted the windshield, and here and there were snow piles six feet high, which will be spread into two feet of eminently skiable base and powder when Windham reopens today. The ski center opened 10 days later than scheduled last month because of warm weather, then had to shut back down during last week's grand finale to our preternaturally warm, endless autumn. Of course all the snow was machine-made, its blizzard the result of an incessant frigid hiss from three kinds of blowers going full tilt on 11 of Windham's 46 trails. The other 35 had grass poking out from a dainty white frosting. And the good old days doesn't mean a time when a resort like Windham could depend on real blizzards. ''Natural snow for us is icing on the cake,'' said Tim Woods, Windham's general manager. ''It's great when we get it, but we don't rely on it.'' No, the good old days redefined is when it's cold enough to make snow in December, not last week's nightmare -- 60 degrees, torrential rain, thunder, lightning -- a ski resort catastrophe that shut down virtually everything in the Northeast, even mighty Killington in Vermont, where people assume they can ski from early November well into May. People have their own informal index of climate change, but for those who depend on cold weather and snow for their livelihood, the weather-watching is a good deal less casual than it is for the rest of us. So it turns out there will be good early-December skiing at Windham, at least on the trails that will open today. But of the many canaries in the mineshaft of climate change, some of the most attentive are people like Mr. Armlin and Mr. Woods, who watch the skies from October to March and are increasingly worried by what they see. Consider Mr. Woods, 41, who virtually grew up on snow -- the Woods Valley ski area that his parents owned in Westernville, north of Rome, N.Y. The center operated on natural snow from 1964 to 1980, but a few disastrous winters made it clear that something more reliable was needed. The center has had snow made by machine ever since, and could not have survived otherwise. Mr. Woods watches each too-mild winter at Windham and gets the same queasy feeling. ''The weather's definitely changed,'' he said. ''Every year now when we sit down at budget time, instead of planning cash flow for what would have been a typical year 10 years ago, we basically plan for having a couple of thaws at the very worst possible moments. In the past, the law of averages might say that 3 of 10 years would be lousy. Now our challenge is to remain profitable, figuring that possibly 6 or 7 of 10 will be.'' For Windham and other ski areas that means, first of all, investing in the best snowmaking equipment possible, and upgrading it every year to make more snow than ever, as quickly as possible in warmer temperatures. It means diversifying -- a new skating rink, snowboard attractions that can operate on less snow, a fancy new restaurant. There's consideration of a spa. ''We're trying to hedge our bets against winter being milder and shorter,'' Mr. Woods said, ''looking to give people things to do if the skiing isn't great.'' Of course, making snow on a mountain doesn't make one an expert on climate change. Mr. Armlin, who has the challenge of providing what nature doesn't, would like to think that it's part of a long natural cycle that will swing back the other way. ''Maybe I'm just being optimistic,'' he said. ''Optimism can get you a long way in the ski industry.'' Mr. Woods, who cites oxygen isotope levels and core samples from the polar ice caps, and what is happening with glaciers, is less sanguine. ''There's no question the general trend'' is higher temperatures, he said. ''It's pretty terrifying stuff.'' So will there be skiing in the Catskills in 50 years? And 100 years? Sure, he figures. There are places that now make snow, or ice that's sort of like snow, in June and July. Indoor ski attractions are cropping up in Los Angeles, England, Scotland and Dubai. That might not be winter as we know it. But our recent winters haven't been, either. So the skiing will be in pretty good shape today at Windham, five days after the temperature hit 60 degrees. Whether the planet is doing as well is a much more complicated discussion. OUR TOWNS E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com"
"With the second of two snowstorms in back-to-back weeks swirling through Colorado on Friday, everyone from city officials to holiday travelers was finding coping with the latest one incrementally easier. ''White-Christmas feelings went out the second day of the last blizzard,'' said Steve Snyder, a spokesman for Denver International Airport. ''When you start measuring in feet, the White Christmas doesn't really work.'' While the accumulating snow -- with more in the forecast through the weekend -- caused headaches for many, the second storm was far more manageable than the blizzard that struck on Dec. 20. ''We had 600 people here last night, is all,'' Mr. Snyder said of those who stayed in the airport from Thursday night to Friday. ''Planes were going in and out, so the people that stayed here chose to do so.'' During last week's blizzard, the airport was closed for nearly 48 hours and thousands of people were stranded, many for more than one night. This week, airlines began canceling hundreds of flights in advance of the storm, and offering passengers later flights at no additional cost. ''It's not ideal, but the airport's not closed,'' said Joe Hodas, a spokesman for Frontier Airlines in Denver. Mike Looney, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, said the latest storm system was producing rain and freezing rain into the Nebraska Panhandle and parts of Kansas and Oklahoma. It brought up to two feet of snow in the foothills west of Denver on Thursday and several inches to the south and east, with snow and intermittent increasing winds predicted through the weekend. Even before the second storm hit, Mayor John Hickenlooper was on the defensive about the city's handling of the first storm and took the offensive for the second, as the city realized its shortcomings -- especially in the number of plows on hand, which proved far fewer than needed to clear major roads and side streets adequately. ''It was the first time in the city's history that we had 20 inches of snow in 24 hours,'' Mayor Hickenlooper said. ''We've never had two major snowstorms within one week of each other,'' an occurrence that Mr. Looney called ''unusual.'' This week, Mayor Hickenlooper said, he helped to create a plan to borrow snowplows from organizations like the Denver public schools, rather than buy more. But he said the airport would need to buy more plows, adding, ''We will not get caught in that situation again next year.'' The snow that started falling here on Thursday was heavy and wet, unlike the light, blowing snow last week. ''We're seeing far less abandoned vehicles this time,'' said a Colorado Department of Transportation spokeswoman, Stacey Stegman. Drivers, she said, ''heeded the warnings to stay off the roads, and so our plows could do their jobs.'' Twenty highways were closed on Friday in eastern Colorado, where blizzard conditions limited visibility for drivers. While some travelers gave up on trying to salvage their holiday plans, others listened to each updated forecast as they tried to decide their next move. ''We had it all planned so well,'' said Sterling Cassel, a Denver Rolfer, who spent Christmas with his wife and 5-month-old daughter at a neighbor's house after their flight to Seattle was canceled during the first storm. The couple rescheduled their trip, but before they could leave, Mr. Cassel, 34, broke his leg while helping a friend shovel out his car. Nonetheless, the family flew out of Denver one day ahead of the second snowstorm, only to be told they might not be able to fly back on Sunday, as planned. ''It's one of those funny things,'' Mr. Cassel said. ''You just have to make the best of a bad situation.'' Although the brunt of both snowstorms hit the cities east of the Rockies, ski resorts also got significant snow. The Eldora Ski Resort outside Boulder got 20 inches on Thursday. ''It's beautiful up there right now with the snow on the trees,'' said Molly Cuffe, a spokeswoman for Colorado Ski Country U.S.A. in Denver. ''It's too soon to tell what it will mean for us, but most people start booking their ski trips after New Year's, and essentially the entire world knows we have snow now.''"
"ON Monday, Jan. 18, 1909, New Yorkers woke to a city transformed. A weekend storm of snow and sleet had left everything -- the biggest trees and the smallest bushes, the trolley wires and street lamps -- coated and gleaming with ice, as if made of glass. It was, wrote a reporter for The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, ''as if the fairy queen of childhood days had waved her magic wand and transported us to the kingdom of ice and snow.'' ''In Prospect Park,'' the reporter continued, ''the scenes witnessed were beyond description. Nothing like it has been seen for years, and thousands of persons walked through a perfect garden of wonder.'' We have a good idea what Prospect Park looked like that day because one of the thousands of Brooklynites who went there was a serious amateur photographer named Clinton Irving Jones. Using a 4-by-5 view camera, Mr. Jones took carefully composed photos of the scenes before him. They captured the ice sparkling on the trees like tiny holiday lights, the weaker trees bending under the burden of the ice on their branches, the tracks of the people who went to see it all. In these photographs, which are on display at the Underbridge Pictures gallery in Dumbo through Jan. 28, Mr. Jones recorded the friendlier aspect of a winter storm, its visual beauty in a pastoral place. But his photos did not, of course, reflect the larger reality of that storm. With the exception of the rare power blackout, nothing disrupts life in New York like a winter storm. This was especially true a century ago, long before conveniences like the Weather Channel and 24/7 takeout, and devices like computers and cellphones that make instant communication possible. In those years, even a relatively modest storm like the one that transformed Prospect Park into the proverbial wonderland -- several inches of snow and sleet, a little rain mixed in, followed by an ice-up -- might play havoc with the lives of New Yorkers. When a warm home depended not on the turn of a thermostat dial but on the availability of coal at the grocer's, and when milk was delivered each morning door to door, the inability of horse-drawn delivery vehicles to move about could mean days of hardship. Nor did it take much bad weather to disable the overhead wires that provided telephone and trolley service, or to seriously complicate the efforts of horse-drawn fire and rescue vehicles to reach people in need. DURING the storm in January 1909, for instance, beyond the peaceful confines of Prospect Park, ice-laden trolley wires collapsed in many parts of the city, badly interfering with streetcar traffic and clogging up the streets. Horse-drawn trucks kept getting stuck, further hindering the streetcars, because the horses couldn't advance in the ice and snow; at the Williamsburg Bridge, The Eagle reported, ''The horses attached to a truck fell down and the cars were blocked from 7:35 to 7:55.'' In Long Island City, Queens, telephone wires collapsed onto trolley lines, causing ''a big electrical display'' and a traffic jam. In Manhattan, ice on the third rail was believed to have caused a short circuit that set fire to a car on the Sixth Avenue el. Back in Brooklyn, according to The Eagle, the weather ''put almost the entire fire alarm system in the borough out of commission and created grave danger.'' Emanuel Brutto, a 30-year-old ship's cook from Barbados, was found frozen to death beneath a tarpaulin in a truck on South Street. The New York Times reported that a barge captain had died of ''apoplexy'' during the storm, a condition caused, his crew said, by ''anxiety for the safety of the barge.'' Then, as now, New York had a conspicuous population of homeless people, many hundreds of whom turned to the Department of Public Charities for shelter that weekend. ''Practically all the men and women who applied for shelter were poorly clad, some miserably,'' The Eagle said, ''and many of them were suffering with frostbitten feet and hands.'' All things considered, New York's winters are far from arduous, but the city has been struck by plenty of big storms over the years, many of them notable for one reason or another. The storm of last Feb. 11-12 brought the biggest official snowfall in the city's history, 26.9 inches. The storm of Feb. 9-10, 1969, almost cost Mayor John Lindsay the next election because of his failure to clear the streets of Queens. After the Blizzard of '61, Mayor Robert Wagner banned cars in New York for almost a week, sealing off the city with police checkpoints. During the Depression, storms like the Blizzard of '35 meant government-sponsored snow-removal jobs for thousands of unemployed men. The cleanup of the Blizzard of 1920 included the bizarre sight of soldiers from the chemical warfare service of the United States Army using fuel-spewing flamethrowers to melt snow and ice. Then, of course, there was the legendary Blizzard of '88. It is probable that no inhabitants of the area that is now New York, going all the way back to the Lenape Indians, ever had so hellacious an experience of winter as the New Yorkers of March 1888 did. It wasn't so much the 21 inches of snow, a total surpassed not just last February but also on Dec. 26-27, 1947 (26.4 inches). It was more the winds gusting as high as 85 miles an hour and the single-digit temperatures, and of course the fact that the late-19th-century metropolis simply wasn't sturdy enough to withstand the onslaught, the likes of which it could never have imagined. Given modern New York's far stronger infrastructure, mechanized snow removal and infinitely better communications, it is tempting to believe that no weather event could ever replace that one as the worst in New York history. But one effect of global warming, scientists say, may be more volatile weather, with storms that, if not greater in number, are more intense. So it is probably inadvisable to assume that the worst Mother Nature can inflict on New York has already occurred. WRITTEN accounts of the Blizzard of '88, which killed about 100 people in New York and 300 elsewhere, reveal a basic way in which people were different then. When New Yorkers woke up on the morning of Monday, March 12, and beheld what was clearly an awful and even dangerous day to go out -- snow rapidly accumulating in big drifts, winds gusting at gale force, temperature in the low 20s and dropping -- most of them seem not to have given much thought to staying home. They did not have radios, of course, and could not really have known how much worse things were going to get. Beyond that, though, job protection and workers' benefits were essentially unheard of. People were afraid, and rightly so, that if they didn't show up for work, they would lose not just a day's pay but their livelihood. By that afternoon, New York had become virtually cut off from the rest of the world. The telephone, telegraph, electrical and fire alarm wires strung so precariously above the streets tumbled down. Service on the four elevated train lines was all but knocked out, stranding thousands. Horse-drawn streetcars ground to a halt in the snow and were abandoned, a blessing to the homeless and the lost who took refuge in them. Horses got stuck in the massive drifts and froze to death, only their heads visible above the drifts. Large numbers of sparrows froze to death, too, their lifeless bodies dropping to the street or floating through the air on the wind. Pedestrians became disoriented and fatigued in the blinding snow. The wind was unbelievable, the streets littered with people's hats and headwear. James Algeo, who lived on East 84th Street near the East River, wrote years later about how he and two companions got caught bya gust of wind as they crossed the intersection of Dey Street and Broadway. ''I went sailing up Broadway and landed against the newsstand at Knox Hat Store,'' he recalled. ''One of my companions landed in the Western Union Building, the other went up Park Row and landed at the old World Building.'' New York's streets at the time were notoriously filthy, and the faces of many pedestrians were left blotched and scratched not just by the searing, horizontally blowing snow, itself like tiny particles of glass raked against the skin, but also by the grit and trash that had lain on the streets and was wedged between the cobblestones. Frostbite was a major problem. Police officers kept an eye on pedestrians' ears, and if they saw a pair that looked too white, they took the person aside and rubbed the suspect ears with snow, in the mistaken belief that such an action would prevent frostbite. Another old wives' tale of the time was that alcohol was a good way to fortify oneself against the extreme cold. The city's saloons were packed during the Blizzard of '88, and many a pickled townsman made the mistake of trying to negotiate the perilous streets, only to end up floundering in a snowdrift. Not all were lucky enough to be pulled out while they were alive. Clinton Irving Jones, the almost forgotten photographer of the New York ice storm of 1909, was a native of Tompkins County, far upstate, and it is not known if he was living in the city during the Blizzard of '88. But his photos of Prospect Park suggest that as devastating as the storm was, he would have liked to be around for it."
"Thousands of travelers were stranded at airports and shelters Thursday after a blizzard on Wednesday paralyzed Colorado and parts of other Western states. ''This is one of those storms that you tell your grandkids about,'' said Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Silver Spring, Md. Snowfall measured over 50 inches in the Rocky Mountain foothills, and drifts reached more than five feet on airport runways. Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado declared a state of emergency on Wednesday, calling in National Guard troops to help stranded motorists reach home, a hotel or Red Cross shelters. Denver International Airport, where nearly 5,000 people were stuck overnight on Wednesday, was to remain closed until noon Friday. Mr. Feltgen said the storm first hit parts of Arizona and New Mexico before bringing snow across Colorado and to parts of Kansas, Nebraska and Wyoming. ''There were 30- to 40-mile-per-hour winds with falling snow, which by definition is a blizzard,'' he said. ''The snow was accumulating too fast to keep up with it.'' Cities along Colorado's Front Range could not plow roads fast enough as the snow kept falling for over 24 hours, leaving 20 to 30 inches in Denver. Light-rail trains and bus service were canceled here through most of Thursday, and officials said it could be Saturday before side streets in Denver were plowed. Mail delivery was canceled and most businesses, including malls, were closed during the busiest shopping time of the year. With cars, trucks and buses abandoned on the roads, the cleanup from the storm is expected to take several days. On Wednesday morning, Ray Ragonese was one of many people who headed to work as usual. When he tried to drive home in the afternoon, he got stuck on a highway off-ramp for seven hours. He and a few other drivers decided to run the engine in just one car at a time and go from car to car to stay warm, using up all but one-quarter tank of gas in each car. ''We were in survival mode,'' Mr. Ragonese, 45, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. ''Here's what was going through our minds: If I run out of gas, I'm going to freeze to death, so we better do something about this.'' A plow finally came and Mr. Ragonese was able to make it to a hotel, where he shared a room with one of the drivers he had met on the exit ramp. ''Long story short, we managed to get to the hotel and we're alive,'' he said. At Denver International Airport, thousands of passengers were bused to hotels and many others slept on the floor. ''We hate to see it, especially at this time of year,'' said Chuck Cannon, an airport spokesman. ''We know these people are going to visit family and friends, and it's doubly tough to see kids who did not make it to Grandma's house. But people are making the best of it and understand it's Mother Nature; we can't do a lot about it.'' By Thursday morning, those not grounded at the airport or in a shelter began skiing, snowshoeing, sledding and snowboarding around their neighborhoods. ''Now it's fun because we are all together,'' said Andrea Flanagan, who had been worried when her husband, Matt, was walking home on Wednesday. ''We've been out sledding and building forts and just having so much fun today.'' The weakened storm moved east on Thursday with freezing rain in the Dakotas and Minnesota. Flooding Hits New Orleans NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 21 (AP) -- Heavy rains filled many streets in New Orleans and neighboring Jefferson Parish with a foot or more of water Thursday, snarling traffic, closing schools and raising concerns about the next hurricane season. ''Unbelievable,'' said Pamela Borne, who waded to her midtown New Orleans house through knee-high water with her daughter. The ground-level ''basement'' of her family's house, where she had stashed Christmas presents, had four inches of water before noon, Ms. Borne said. ''It's very disappointing, that just with an overnight rain of this magnitude, that the city is so ill-prepared,'' she said. Pumping stations, closely watched since the catastrophic flooding after Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, struggled to keep pace. All of the city's pumps were working, but some storm drains were clogged by debris, like tree leaves, said Robert Mendoza, director of the Public Works Department in New Orleans."
"It is the dead of winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and everyone in this part of the world knows what that means. Along with snowstorms, ice and glacial winds, there are sure to be thousands of trucks and cars stranded for days here at the choke point of commerce in South America, 12,671 feet up in the Andes. That has been the case again this winter. The majestic, snow-capped Andes run the full length of the border between Argentina and Chile, but it is on the road from Santiago to Mendoza, here where the Christ the Redeemer Tunnel cuts through the cordillera, that the bulk of the road traffic between the countries is concentrated -- and confusion and privation are most likely to occur. ''This is the most important cargo point on the entire continent, but we are subject to the vagaries of the weather,'' said Juan Abarca Cordero, the Chilean director of the busy border complex here. ''When the condors fly down from the heights to seek shelter and the fog closes in on the peaks, you can be certain that a bad storm is on the way and you are going to have to close the road.'' Less than a mile below the crossing is Portillo, one of South America's fanciest ski resorts, where some rooms run more than $500 a night. As the highway zigs and zags toward the summit, it passes several times under chairlifts that transport skiers from the slopes to the warmth of their hotel at day's end. Truckers, though, pride themselves on their toughness, and in any case cannot afford to stay at the resort. Every year a few of them die of exposure or heart attacks attributed to below-freezing temperatures, the stress of driving the route or being stuck for days at truck ''patios'' on both sides of the border. The terrain along the route is anything but hospitable. Aconcagua, which at an estimated 22,840 feet is the highest mountain peak in the world outside the Himalayas, lies just to the northeast, and as the road winds its way to this border post, there are precipitous drop-offs to gorges and canyons below. And when the crossing is closed because of snowstorms, as it was for more than a week in late July, as many as 5,000 trucks can back up on the frontier, waiting for the weather to clear. Along a roadside some 40 miles from the border, for example, a group of Brazilian truck drivers, some first-timers clad in shorts, had been stranded for 12 days and were fretting about the cold and the money and time they were losing. While they wait, the truckers sleep in the cabins of their trucks, many of which are equipped with simple cooking gear. They go days without a bath, and have to use the side of the road for their physical necessities. To keep warm during the day, they sip yerba mat√©, a bitter, caffeinated herbal tea widely consumed in the southern half of South America, and at night they resort to bonfires. ''Every time you cross the cordillera, it's a new adventure,'' said Vilmar Rocha, 40, a Brazilian and 22-year veteran of the route. ''But this time of year, it is also a suffering. You're cold, you're tired, you're hungry, you smell of diesel smoke and you'd give anything for a bar of soap, a warm shower and a clean bed.'' Truck traffic, cheaper than sea or air shipments, has increased here by an average of 10 percent a year over the past decade, Mr. Abarca said, with Brazil, the region's largest economy, accounting for nearly half the movement. On a busy day, as many as 1,200 trucks, many more than 60 feet long, pass through here. For years, both Argentina and Chile have sought alternatives to the treacherous roadway, which narrows to only two lanes in many of its most mountainous stretches. There has been talk, for instance, of spending $1.5 billion or more to build a longer tunnel to accommodate the mounting traffic, revamping a railway closed in 1979 and even installing heating coils in the roadbed, as some nations have done in the Alps. On average, bad weather forces this border crossing to close for 40 days in the winter months between May and September. Last year, though, that figure rose to 46 days because of 48 feet of snowfall and an avalanche that buried a dozen trucks, destroying some and sweeping others over a cliff. Remarkably, no one was killed, though the drivers know the threat of death is always there. ''Never lose your fear of the cordillera, that's what I've learned,'' said Adriano Pl√°cido, a 24-year-old Brazilian who said he had made the crossing 20 times since becoming a driver a little over a year ago. ''The fear keeps you alert and focused, with your adrenaline flowing. The minute you lose that fear and start to relax, you run the risk of losing your life.'' July may be the worst month on the route, not just because of the weather but because schools are closed for winter vacation and families are on the move. With the strong Chilean peso and a booming Argentine economy, tourism is thriving, which means plenty of inexperienced drivers on the road. ''They see something interesting and decide to stop to take a picture,'' complained Jos√© Luis Carrizo, an Argentine truck driver from Buenos Aires. ''They forget there are three trucks right in back of them, riding their brakes and dragging 50 tons of cargo behind.'' But a few truckers also bring along their wives and children during the winter school break. Marina Marques, 35, said that because she and her two sons, ages 11 and 8, had never seen snow, they decided to accompany her husband, Dirceu, 37, on one of his runs across the Andes from their home in southern Brazil. Ms. Marques said that by coming along she had gained new respect for her husband's work. But she also said she couldn't imagine returning. ''I don't ever want to see snow or ice again,'' she said. ''When I get home, I'm even going to sell my refrigerator.'' Paso Los Libertadores Journal"
"Carol Yerdon has no doubt that the snowstorm that hit Oswego County was a big one. From her living room windows, Mrs. Yerdon can see virtually nothing but white: the snow swallowed so much of her home that it resembles a giant marshmallow with a driveway. A field out back has accumulated 52 inches -- more than four feet -- and if she wanted to walk in her front yard she would need not just her snowshoes, but maybe a bulldozer. Mrs. Yerdon does not rely on visual evidence, however, even when it is overwhelming. She seeks hard numbers: the kind printed on her yardstick. As a volunteer observer for the National Weather Service, Mrs. Yerdon has been stepping onto her deck four times a day to measure the snowfall from the lake-effect storm burying parts of the county. When she added up the daily totals since Feb. 3, Mrs. Yerdon got an astounding number: 141 inches. Meteorologists at the Weather Service said on Sunday that a total approaching 12 feet might be a state record for snowfall in a single storm. Which placed Mrs. Yerdon, a 43-year-old substitute teacher, at the center of what qualified in this snow-covered county as high drama: How much snow really fell on Redfield? Patrons at Penny's Redfield General Store on County Route 17, the town's plowed thoroughfare, debated the 12-foot tally. Sitting on a chair at Penny's, Shirley Ouderkirk, 77, said it snowed harder in March 1947. ''We couldn't get out of Redfield for a week,'' recalled Ms. Ouderkirk, a native. ''They brought bread in by airplane.'' Officials at the Weather Service said on Sunday that the tally was unofficial, and they were dispatching experts to Redfield, reviewing how the measurements were taken and checking radar data. Mrs. Yerdon, who has been measuring snow for more than a decade, was busy Monday morning, calling Weather Service officials in Buffalo and defending her numbers to reporters. ''I'm not using any tricks,'' she said, apologizing for not having cooked something for her surprise guests. ''I got a yardstick.'' It is a simple wooden yardstick, from Deaton's Home Center, a hardware store in nearby Pulaski that was giving them away. When it is snowing, Mrs. Yerdon sticks it into the fresh snow on her deck, clears the snow and then jots the daily totals in a small journal that doubles as a diary. Since Saturday, when she and her husband shoveled a mound of snow from the roof onto the deck, she has been doing her measurements beside the deck, at a spot right outside her back door. The journal entry for Thursday showed 23 inches. Above it, she had scribbled: ''Worked on taxes.'' Mrs. Yerdon's method is old-fashioned, as is Redfield, a town of 647 residents in the woods east of Lake Ontario in upstate New York. Cellphone signals are nonexistent; the folks at Penny's point travelers to a pay phone next door. These days, Redfield looks and feels like Antarctica. There is a muffled silence, the only sound at times the clanking of the flagpole outside the red-brick building that houses the post office. So much snow sits on a basketball court that it nearly touches the rim on one backboard. Only the very tops of things are visible: street signs, barns, churches. Mrs. Yerdon, who is originally from Baldwinsville, near Syracuse, moved 13 years ago to Redfield, the hometown of her husband, Tim. By late morning Monday, she was not sure if the Weather Service would deem her numbers official, though she had followed its rules, measuring four times a day -- sometimes as late as midnight. Of the prospect of breaking the state record, she said, ''It would be exciting, but at this point, it's hard to say.'' By early evening, officials of the Weather Service said that Mrs. Yerdon's 141 inches was accurate. But, alas, Redfield would not make the record books. Tom Niziol, the meteorologist in charge at the Buffalo office of the Weather Service, said his colleagues misspoke on Sunday in describing Redfield's snowfall as a potential state record. He said his office did not recognize a state record for the most snowfall in a single storm. In 2001, he said, 127 inches of snow fell in Montague, a tiny town northeast of here, over five days; to compare that with this year's 10-day storm in Redfield, he said, would be like comparing apples and oranges. Or two snowflakes."
"For the sixth straight day, powerful squalls of snow pounded a string of towns and villages along eastern Lake Ontario yesterday, burying parts of upstate New York, shutting down highways, schools and government offices, and blanketing homes in layers of snow that at times came down as fast as five inches an hour. By last night, strong gusts of wind that had been blowing since Saturday had deposited more than six feet of snow in towns and villages throughout Oswego County, and weather forecasters were predicting that many of those areas would be hit by at least two more feet of snow by the end of this weekend. As emergency crews struggled yesterday to clear roads and dig out stranded motorists, Gov. Eliot Spitzer declared a state of emergency in and around Oswego County. One of the hardest-hit areas was the city of Oswego, a community of 17,800 people about 40 miles northwest of Syracuse that as of last night had been buried in more than 72 inches of snow. Schools were closed all week, the streets were lined with snowbanks 12 feet high, and whiteouts forced the state police to temporarily close a 15-mile stretch of Interstate 81. ''The problem is that anytime there's a lull in the action and we start cleaning it up, here it comes again,'' Mayor Randy Bateman said. ''We're just trying to keep up with it.'' Two people who had been trapped in their car were hospitalized for carbon monoxide poisoning, and several people suffered heart attacks related to shoveling snow, state officials and a spokeswoman for Oswego General Hospital said. But there were no reports of deaths or serious injuries directly related to the storm, officials said. A meteorologist with the National Weather Service, Tom Niziol, said that this storm differed from others because it has lasted so long. In general, lake-effect storms, which are caused by subzero winds that pick up heat and moisture as they blow over Lake Ontario, last for a couple of days in one area and then move elsewhere as the wind direction changes. But in this case, those winds have come from only one direction, west, depositing snow on a 10-mile-by-75-mile area downwind of Lake Ontario, Mr. Niziol said. ''It's like putting one end of a hose into the lake and then taking the nozzle and pointing it in one direction over Oswego County,'' he said. ''If you look at a satellite image showing the band of precipitation, there is literally a narrow band of snowfall with clear skies on either side.'' As the storm swept along the eastern edge of the lake yesterday, it created major delays and hazardous conditions. But the snowfall was still nowhere near records set by lake-effect storms. In 2001, the town of Montague, a few miles southeast of Watertown, received 127 inches in a five-day period, and some towns in Oswego County have had more than 200 inches of snow in a single year. In towns and villages along the eastern edge of Lake Ontario, residents watched in dismay as their travel plans were disrupted and their homes covered in snow. In the village of Mexico, about 15 miles east of Oswego, Josh Tillotson, 25, said he spent six hours yesterday shoveling snow in his driveway on Main Street, which was lined with piles of plowed snow at least 10 feet high. ''Sometimes it's just like trying to bail out the ocean,'' Mr. Tillotson said. ''It's impossible to keep up.'' By midday yesterday the snow had tapered off, but even as the sun began to break through, weather forecasters and state officials warned that the worst might still be ahead. Residents of Oswego and other towns just off the lake were cautioned that the snow could pick up again and deposit two more feet by Sunday. A spokeswoman for the State Department of Transportation, Jennifer Post, said the agency had dispatched about 115 workers from Albany with 35 plows, blowers and snow-clearing trucks to supplement the workers and equipment in 17 towns and villages throughout Oswego County. They are expected to reach their destinations by today. ''We've got crews working around the clock to ensure that state roads remain clear and open,'' Ms. Post said. ''But our focus right now is turning to local municipalities and their snow removal efforts.''"
"THE world is supposed to contract in the winter, to shrink inside a dark shell, to tighten like a drum. The sun retracts, the light drains, the warmth leaks away. A bony carapace grows over the land, and the soul. Everything soft and green deflates, hardens to a gray, stony core. This winter, though, the wires got crossed. Fishermen gassed up their boats, golfers dug their clubs out of the corners of their garages. Runners needed nothing but T-shirts and shorts. Farmers harvested leeks in January. Perennials debated whether it was time to bloom. The annual Florida diaspora began to look like a quaint anachronism from an era before global warming. Why bother migrating south when the south had migrated north? A penitential blast of cold finally descended, abruptly and belatedly, in mid-January, culminating with a Valentine's Day storm that locked our region in a substance that had begun to seem endangered: ice. It was the kind of ice that we hadn't seen for a while, the kind of ice that lasted. The pond is actually frozen? Where are those skates? Shards of ice, shed by coated vehicles, littered the roads last week, as if the air itself had shattered from the sudden hammer of winter. As bleak a scene as it was, though, there was promise in it. The cold came so fast that the false spring of earlier weeks was, we can only hope, flash-frozen beneath that brittle crust. A warm, soft, green world is already growing under there, impatient to emerge. We know it, because we saw it already, when we weren't supposed to. KEVIN COYNE"
"A day after telling New Yorkers to stop ''griping'' over parking tickets issued to snowbound cars, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg apologized yesterday and promised to waive all such tickets issued in the two days after the storm. It was a rare concession for Mr. Bloomberg, who has refused to back down in the face of past outcries over a smoking ban, a property tax increase and school bus problems, but it showed how Mother Nature can trip up even the most popular mayors. ''I'm sorry for the inconvenience to people, but you know you have to make decisions, and each of these storms is different,'' Mr. Bloomberg told listeners in his weekly radio program on WABC-AM (770). The apology was aimed at drivers across the city who raised a furor after receiving tickets for not moving cars trapped in rock-hard snowbanks by city plowing in accordance with alternate-side parking rules. City officials, who often suspend these rules after snowstorms, had said keeping them in place this time around was important to help speed the cleanup. ''In retrospect, in some parts of the city there was not that much snow, and in other parts it probably really was an imposition,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in the radio address. ''We did get a lot of calls and listened very carefully to what the Sanitation Department heard, to what our Community Assistance Unit heard, took a look at what calls came into 311.'' About 4,000 tickets were issued Thursday, and an unknown number were given out yesterday by officers who were unaware that the rules had been suspended, the mayor said. But he said the tickets would be wiped off the city's parking enforcement computer. Alternate-side parking enforcement, meanwhile, has been suspended through the holiday weekend and will resume Tuesday. ''If you received a ticket yesterday or today, you don't have to respond to it,'' the mayor said. The decision was a complete turnaround from Thursday, when the mayor, besieged by complaints, seemed to respond defensively. ''We want to get the snow and ice off the roads as quickly as possible so emergency vehicles can get through, so that you can get to work, so that the kids can get to school,'' he told reporters Thursday at a Sanitation Department garage in Queens. ''And if we all do it together rather than griping, we'll be better off.'' His earlier position was more in keeping with how he has responded to past criticisms of his actions. Most recently, when complaints erupted over the city's decision to cut more than 100 school bus routes, Mr. Bloomberg attacked his critics as do-nothing complainers who ''have no experience in doing anything.'' The mayor's initial response to the parking complaints also brought to mind the treacherous politics of snow, notably the 1969 blizzard that paralyzed Queens while city plows stayed away. The failure to clear Queens streets contributed to a sense that John V. Lindsay was a Manhattan-centric mayor out of touch with the concerns of other boroughs. Mayor Bloomberg's early refusal to suspend the parking rules has echoes of Mayor Lindsay's missteps, said Vincent J. Cannato, author of ''The Ungovernable City: John Lindsay and His Struggle to Save New York.'' ''It comes across as unbelievably arrogant, and that's just symbolic of larger things,'' Mr. Cannato said, adding that he did not think Mayor Bloomberg wanted to come across that way. Mayor Bloomberg's change of heart, however, did not dull all of the pain. People who had moved their cars harbored resentment for having to do so in the first place. Corrie A. Baum, a 31-year-old graphic designer who lives in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, said she struggled to move her four-wheel-drive vehicle from its ice-encrusted spot Thursday morning, then spent another 20 minutes trying to find a spot that was not sealed off by snowbanks. Told yesterday that it was all for naught because tickets had been canceled and the rules relaxed, she laughed and said, ''How nice.'' Because of term limits, Mr. Bloomberg is not facing re-election in 2009, so he does not have to worry about following in the footsteps of Michael Bilandic, the Chicago mayor who lost a re-election bid after a blizzard there in 1979. In that episode, ''the mayor ended up coming under extraordinary criticism, not only for failing to clear the snow off the streets, but also for changing the train schedule to skip by black neighborhoods in an effort to speed up delayed service,'' said Eric Klinenberg, an associate professor of sociology at New York University and author of ''Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago.'' Yesterday, Councilwoman Letitia James of Brooklyn praised Mr. Bloomberg for changing his mind, but she said parking tickets, which carry fines of $45 to $65, should also be suspended for Wednesday, when the mayor called on city drivers to take public transportation instead of risking treacherous roads. ''It is unconscionable to ticket drivers for being safe,'' she said in a statement. ''Dismissing the tickets is the right thing to do.'' Stu Loeser, a spokesman for the mayor, said tickets issued Wednesday would not be canceled because most cars were not trapped by snow or by plowing until Thursday. That did not sit well with some people who received tickets Wednesday. ''The first day was really more treacherous,'' said Suzanne Meehan, 43, a co-owner of the Crossroads Cafe in Brooklyn, who got a ticket while scraping ice and snow off the sidewalk. She had parked across the street, assuming the parking rules were suspended, as they had been in the past."
"Gov. Edward G. Rendell on Friday ordered a review of the state's ''unacceptable'' response to an ice and snow storm that left thousands of people stranded, some for more than a day, on long sections of three major Interstate highways in Central Pennsylvania. State Police and Department of Transportation officials blamed the storm that started on Wednesday; heavy traffic; accidents; and hilly, rural conditions for the mess, which reached its zenith on Thursday with a 50-mile traffic jam on Interstate 78. ''All those things are true,'' Governor Rendell said at a news conference, ''but all those things are no excuse for the response by the State of Pennsylvania.'' He said the review would be conducted by members of his staff and by a former director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, James Lee Witt, whom Mr. Rendell hired as a private consultant. The last of the stranded vehicles were finally removed from the three major east-west routes, Interstates 78, 80 and 81, early Friday morning, and the state's transportation secretary, Allen D. Biehler, said crews would work round-the-clock to clear the highways of up to six inches of ice. Large parts of each Interstate remained closed late Friday. About 200 tractor-trailers that had been diverted from Interstate 81 in Hamburg after it was closed nearly filled the parking lot of the Schuylkill Mall there on Friday night. Floyd Bossett, 55, a trucker from Pittsburgh, was hauling freight from McAllen, Tex., to Cheshire, Conn., when he was detoured into the parking lot at 9:30 p.m. on Thursday. He said he passed the time Thursday night into Friday reading paperback novels in his cab while some other truckers went to see the movie ''Norbit.'' ''The worst part is I'd really like to take a shower,'' Mr. Bossett said. After the authorities closed the three Interstates on Thursday evening, the state began waiving tolls on all major toll roads to keep traffic moving, especially on Interstate 76 (the Pennsylvania Turnpike) and 476 (the Turnpike's Northeast Extension). The waiver was still in effect Friday night, costing the state up to $1.5 million daily, said Bill Capone, a spokesman for the Turnpike Commission. On Friday morning, the Turnpike suffered its own weather-related headache when a sheet of ice flew off the top of a westbound tractor-trailer and went through the windshield of an eastbound tanker truck carrying xylene, a flammable liquid. There was no fire, but the Turnpike was closed east of Harrisburg until 5 p.m. ''It just made matters worse,'' Mr. Capone said. State officials said the problems began Wednesday when about a half-foot of snow fell on the three highways, which roll through the hills of Central Pennsylvania and are major commuter and truck routes to New York City. The snow was followed by rain and sleet, which formed a sheet of ice. Dozens of cars skidded into one another, tractor-trailers jack-knifed and vehicles stalled. ''It was really a perfect storm for bad driving conditions,'' said Steve Chizmar, a transportation department spokesman. Conditions were so bad that some of the 511 Army and Air National Guard troops called out to help had to use Humvees to get State Police officers to highway locations that had become almost inaccessible. Governor Rendell said there apparently was a communications breakdown among agencies responsible for dealing with such disasters. At a conference call at 5 p.m. Wednesday with emergency management officials, he said, no one mentioned that large numbers of motorists were stranded. Governor Rendell said he was alerted to that only at about 8 p.m., by a trooper who came to his residence in Harrisburg. The governor said he immediately mobilized the National Guard. Reggie Jackson, 36, a short-haul driver for U.P.S., said he could attest to the communications problems. Mr. Jackson said he was driving his double-tractor-trailer east on the Pennsylvania Turnpike about 2 p.m. on Wednesday. Thirty minutes after he left the Turnpike, Mr. Jackson said, he hit stalled traffic on I-78 near Strausstown. He did not move again for 211/2 hours. ''There were no signs that the highways were shut down, nothing,'' he said. ''And on the way out that morning, when you knew a big snowstorm was coming, I didn't see any state trucks along the highway waiting for the snow.'' Mr. Jackson said he was among many truckers who spent much of the time checking on people in cars and S.U.V.'s. Meanwhile, local residents on snowmobiles and four-wheelers began making trips out to the highways with food and water. ''It wasn't the state or the National Guard, it was the truck drivers and locals checking on everyone,'' Mr. Jackson said. Though the Pennsylvania National Guard said it began sending troops out at 4 p.m. Wednesday, Mr. Jackson said he did not see anyone from the Guard until 11 a.m. Thursday. After a night trying to stay warm in his cab and using his cellphone to speak with his three children and his wife, he was finally able to move at noon Thursday, but only to get his rig off the highway. With the roads still closed, he was still stranded Friday evening, plotting a route on local roads to deliver his two trailers full of packages to the U.P.S. depot in Parsippany, N.J. ''I just want to get home,'' he said. Correction: February 21, 2007, Wednesday An article on Saturday about an examination of Pennsylvania's response to a major snowstorm referred incorrectly to the part of the state where motorists were stranded on three major highways and misstated the direction of one of the highways, Interstate 81. The area was eastern Pennsylvania, not central Pennsylvania. Interstate 81 is designated north-south, not east-west."
"Laurence Earner said he had 108 feet of snow to shovel. That is 108 feet horizontally, the length of the sidewalk in front and along the side of his house in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn. Vertically, only an inch or so stood between him and a clear walk. And a lot of huffing and puffing. Yes, it snowed yesterday. The temptation is to acknowledge the arrival of weather that felt genuinely wintry by inserting the word ''finally'' into that sentence -- yes, it finally snowed yesterday in a city where people were wondering if they would see much more than another dusting before spring. It also sleeted and rained. The big, slow-moving storm delivered a nasty cocktail -- slushy underfoot, dirty the moment the first car rumbled through it, brackish if it melted. ''It's not rain, it's not snow -- I'm shoveling margaritas,'' said a man clearing the front steps at Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn. Whatever it was, it pelted windows and roofs on a day that seemed as haunting as a minor-key Beethoven bagatelle. The National Weather Service said it measured 2 inches of snow in Central Park and in New Canaan, Conn., and Wyckoff, N.J. It reported 2.5 inches in Yonkers and 1.5 inches in Fort Lee, N.J. Compounding the misery, the wind howled in umbrella-inverting gusts -- 51 miles per hour in White Plains at 4 p.m., 39 m.p.h. in Queens, the National Weather Service said. ''It was all the negatives: windy, blowing in your face,'' said Suzanne Meehan, the co-owner of a cafe in Brooklyn. ''I wished it was more of the puffy, powdery snow that stuck to the trees, more of a winter wonderland. By afternoon, it felt bleak.'' The culprit was a huge weather system that The Associated Press said was to blame for three deaths in Nebraska, two each in Indiana and Delaware, and one each in Missouri and Ohio. The storm gave schoolchildren a day off up and down the East Coast. It also left travelers stranded because hundreds of flights were canceled in the Northeast. And more than 129,000 customers were without power in the Washington and Baltimore areas. In the New York region, ice weighing down power lines led to a number of headaches, and not just about power failures. Wires that sagged over the Long Island Rail Road tracks between Wantagh and Seaford were blamed for an hourlong disruption on the railroad's Babylon branch. A tractor-trailer accident at a crossing on the Ronkonkoma branch also slowed commuters heading home. In New York City, as homeowners like Mr. Earner got out their shovels, the Sanitation Department dispatched 1,500 plows and trucks, but crews spent much of the day spreading salt while waiting to begin plowing. Matt LePanney, a spokesman for the department, said the fleet could not begin plowing until at least two inches of snow have fallen, and the crews were on the roads long before that much accumulated. Using the plows when there is less snow on the ground ''could damage the streets, damage the plow,'' he said. He said that trash and recycling pickups would resume today and that the department would catch up on collections missed yesterday. Thousands of homes lost power as ice weighed down electrical lines. In New Jersey, a spokeswoman for Public Service Electric and Gas, Karen Johnson, said about 18,900 customers were without service, mostly because of problems with two substations in Gloucester County. She said utility workers were checking the lines to locate the problem. On Long Island, power to 6,000 customers was knocked out, a spokeswoman for the Long Island Power Authority said. Drivers said roads throughout the metropolitan area were slick, and traffic officials warned of black ice. The New Jersey State Police reported 1,400 accidents between 5 p.m. Tuesday and 3 p.m. yesterday. Officials said four people were killed in separate accidents. Two of the victims were drivers standing beside their disabled cars who were hit by other vehicles, one on the Garden State Parkway in Little Egg Harbor Township and one on the New Jersey Turnpike in Newark. A third victim, a 15-year-old pedestrian, was killed in Estell Manor in Atlantic County. In addition, one person died in an two-car accident on Sunrise Highway in Baldwin on Long Island yesterday evening. At the airports, it was slow going. Pasquale DiFulco, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said 500 flights were canceled at Newark Liberty, La Guardia and Kennedy International. It was about 4 p.m. when 130 passengers on JetBlue's 8:15 a.m. flight to Canc√∫n got off the plane -- still at Kennedy. ''We've been out here so long the wheels have frozen into the slush,'' said one passenger, Carolyn Faucher of Tucson, who called news organizations from her cellphone as the day wore on. She said the plane had been without electricity and heat for part of the day. A spokeswoman for JetBlue said the airline had expected the weather to let up enough in midmorning for the plane to take off. But that did not happen. She called the situation ''unacceptable'' and apologized to the customers, saying they would be given refunds and tickets on JetBlue. The mail got through on Vanderbilt Street in Windsor Terrace because the letter carrier, Randy Kessler, dragged his mail cart down middle of the street -- he could not navigate the sidewalk. ''No one was shoveling,'' he said as he finished his rounds, an hour and a half behind schedule. ''The ice balls were hitting me in the face. It's cold.'' Maybe the mail got through, but some Valentine's Day flower deliveries did not. ''We've got one, two, three, four, six of them sitting here,'' said Deborah Zalondek, the owner of a flower shop in Schenectady, N.Y. She said that her father, who is one of her deliverers, could not get through, even though his sport utility vehicle has four-wheel drive. ''He keeps getting stuck in front of the store,'' she said."
"THE snowmaking conditions were terrific at the Heaven house a few Sundays ago: it was 17 degrees and very dry, a felicitous temperature-to-humidity ratio that would hold well into the following week. Marshall Heaven, a cheerful 53-year-old real estate developer in a red ski parka, had had his two snow guns running since the previous Friday; the 15-foot Dr. Seussian heap of snow that occupies the Heavens' sloping backyard each year from late November to early April was looking particularly impressive. Gabby, a 9-month-old cockapoo, was flopping about on and in it, her blond fur crusted with ice. Alexandra Heaven, 4 1/2, was bright pink in the face and just about to her limit; she had been sledding nonstop for two hours. Her mother, Mary Ann, 52, a former television reporter and producer who now works with her husband, scooped up both child and dog and hauled them inside for a warm-up. For some, Valentine's Day is much too late in the year for their first snow. Since Nature can no longer keep to her early deadlines, men like Mr. Heaven (snowmaking, like barbecuing, is still a gendered hobby) are taking matters into their own hands, and creating their own seasons, at least when it comes to winter. Snowmaking, since the mid-1960s the provenance of ski resorts and, more recently, some party planners, has gone domestic. Companies like Snow Economics, a maker and inventor of resort-quality snow machines in Natick, Mass. -- from which Mr. Heaven bought his two Backyard Blizzard snowmakers a few years ago -- have been selling home snowmakers since 2000. Snow at Home, a Cheshire, Conn., company run by Matt Pittman and Ken Jackie, has been shipping snowmakers for use in backyards from New Jersey to New Zealand for four years; sales are now ''in the hundreds,'' Mr. Pittman said. ''We've hit every state but Hawaii,'' he said last week. Mr. Pittman, who was speaking by cellphone, was with a client near Morristown, N.J., helping to put the finishing touches on what was essentially the client's personal resort, he said: a 200-foot-long slope behind the house with a warming hut at its foot and two snow machines at its peak. The previous summer, trees had been cleared and water and power lines buried below the soil's frost line, ready to hook up to two of Mr. Pittman's machines. ''New Jersey is a big area for us,'' Mr. Pittman said. ''There's no snow, and lots of disposable income.'' David Young, 38, who owns two Snow at Home machines, lives 15 minutes by car from Atlantic City; he has been making snow in his backyard for three years. Early last week he had two feet of snow; one day last week he took a personal day from his boat repair business to make snow all day, he said. ''It's hard to stop when the weather is right,'' he said. ''You can set the guns up and go to sleep, but I like to go and mess with them. My neighbors are going to work at the casinos at 3 a.m. and I'm out there, too, messing with the guns. I just like being out in it. It's really hard to turn the guns off; it looks so good piling up.'' When real snow falls, Mr. Young said, ''my daughter thinks I made it.'' When you mix real snow with machine snow, Mr. Heaven said, the real stuff, which is lighter and fluffier, falls to the side and creates a cushion. ''It's great for when the kids are playing king of the mountain,'' he said. ''They have this soft powder to fall in.'' Those who make snow are proud of their powder. They speak passionately about its stacking qualities (it is denser than snow that starts out in a cloud) and bandy about terms like nucleation and wet bulb temperature. Forums like snowguns.com, which has over 3,700 members, show a subculture as much into the process of snowmaking as the result of it. There are discussions about how to build your own rope tow and lengthy back-and-forths about the attributes of various snow wand nozzles. Still, size matters to a snowmaker. Mr. Young dreams of a ''bigger vertical,'' he said. ''Everyone who makes snow wants a larger hill.'' Mr. Heaven dreams of a commercial machine, an 18-nozzle gun that would make a hill like his in an hour, he said. ''It's a serious commitment,'' he said, and it would require a concrete platform to mount the thing, which costs about $30,000. ''It's a whole different story,'' he said, indicating that his wife was not yet on board with a system upgrade. ''It's his avocation,'' Ms. Heaven said. ''And I indulge him in it, the same way he indulges me by letting me have a pink house.'' The Heavens' house, a late-19th-century carriage house they doubled the size of last year, is a pink-and-white gingerbread-style confection that cries out for the sort of frosty ground and tree cover Mr. Heaven's machines can make. Inside, there are pink Aubusson rugs and gilded walls; a ceiling fresco featuring many fat putti is in the works for the front hall; and a pair of Italian gilded angel wings sits in a wall niche made just for them. ''Mount Heaven was a no-brainer,'' said Ms. Heaven, referring to her name for the snow hill her husband made, and pointing to the peak from her daughter's bedroom window upstairs. ''You've got a lot to work with when you have a name like ours.'' As global warming continues to wreak havoc with the weather, snowmakers impose a nostalgic order -- albeit one that does nothing to help the situation, since snowmaking runs on electricity (and water, of course, one and a half to six gallons a minute, depending on the size of the machine). Charles Santry, president of Snow Economics, said his Backyard Blizzard Sport machine, which has a 1.5 horsepower engine, can use up to 1,650 watts. A clothes dryer guzzles more power, but snowmaking is certainly not going to win any green awards. In fact, snowmaking requires ''traditional'' winter weather -- that is, temperatures well below freezing. And last year New York and Connecticut were two of the five states that posted their warmest Decembers on record. Mount Heaven melted twice that month, Mr. Heaven said ruefully. ''I love the cold,'' he said. ''I love winter.'' Indeed, Mr. Heaven loves all weather, whatever form it comes in. (In high school he wrote a weather column for the school newspaper called Heaven's Heaven.) He was happily monitoring this week's event. ''It's a complicated storm,'' he said yesterday, reporting no melting whatsoever on Mount Heaven. ''But even if it rains, we won't suffer any snowpack loss. The mound is so dense it will just firm it up more.'' Mr. Heaven turned his guns on again yesterday afternoon. He was eager to make more snow."
"First the fire hydrants vanished. Then the tombstones. Then went the mailboxes, parked cars, front doors, stop signs and the bottoms of roadside billboards. By the time the snow stopped falling this weekend over Oswego County in upstate New York, the streets were lined with snowbanks that obscured anyone walking behind them, shoveling crews were charging upward of $200 an hour to clear the tops of houses, and gawkers were driving in from hours away. ''This is the roof, right?'' Mark Fahnestock, 27, asked his companion, Jessica Stiffler, 26, both of Lancaster, Pa., Sunday after he climbed a snowbank so tall that it merged with the roof of a church in Scriba. She took a photograph of him holding their 2-year-old daughter, Jazmine. They had left home at 5:30 a.m. ''We don't get this kind of snow,'' Ms. Stiffler said. Oswego County, a rustic string of towns and villages on the southeastern rim of Lake Ontario, received 5 to 10 feet of snow over eight days. In one town, Redfield, the National Weather Service reported an unofficial total of 11 feet 8 inches, which would be a state record for snowfall from a single storm event. And the Weather Service said more snow was on the way. By contrast, the New York City record, set exactly one year ago today, was 26.9 inches as measured in Central Park. Life here took on an icy sort of absurdity. People posed for pictures on snowbanks as if they were atop Mount Everest. Someone turned a 25-foot mound of snow in the parking lot of Paul's Big M supermarket in Oswego into a billboard for their snow-blowing service. Someone else painted a different sort of message next to it: a declaration of love, from Brian to Brooke. A bouncer at Old City Hall bar in the city of Oswego cleared the steps outside by pouring salt from a beer pitcher. Workers at Novelis, an aluminum manufacturing plant, slept in an office to keep the factory running throughout the storm. Homeowners dug zigzag mazes to their back doors, to their cars, to their porches. Some were for business, others for pleasure. Tom Boney, 41, built one in his backyard to keep his three children entertained. ''It's good to get out of the house,'' said Mr. Boney, who recently moved to Oswego from Wisconsin with his wife and children. Last week, Gov. Eliot Spitzer declared a state of emergency for the area, sending in extra road-clearing crews and other help, and most of the major thoroughfares had been cleared by Sunday. The authorities said there had been some injuries related to snow removal in the county, but no deaths. ''We have, up to this point, considered ourselves very fortunate that the human-needs aspect has been minimal,'' said Patricia Egan, Oswego County's director of emergency management. Considering their geography and past history of storms, the cities and towns near Lake Ontario were not unprepared. Anthony Leotta, Oswego's longtime city engineer, said that its roads were built an average of about 50 percent wider than in other communities, to allow plows to navigate the streets easily and prevent snowbanks from stopping traffic. Some residents shrugged off the snow the way San Franciscans shrug off earthquakes. They recited inch totals of previous lake-effect storms with pride, often recalling some time when it snowed harder. Kevin Dwyer of Parish, who spent six hours carving a pathway to his back door out of five feet of snow, said he was not overly impressed by the storm. ''This is the second-worst one,'' he said, comparing it unfavorably to one a few years ago. Still, the sheer quantity seemed to catch many others off guard. The State University of New York at Oswego, the alma mater of the television weatherman Al Roker and typically one of the last to give in to conditions, was forced to cancel classes for three days last week. ''We don't know that we have ever done that,'' said Tim Nekritz, a college spokesman. Armed with shovels and the phone numbers of roof clearers who advertised high on the lampposts, people went to work, plowing, blowing, scooping, pushing. On Sunday, a seven-man crew from Ithaca removed the snow from the roof of a house in the village of Mexico. They charged $215 an hour, for a three-hour job. Others lent their labor. ''Everybody pitches in,'' said Steve Canale, 53, owner of the Press Box bar and restaurant on First Street in Oswego. ''If somebody drives by with a plow, they'll stop and help you.'' Restaurants, gas stations and supermarkets were doing a brisk business -- slower than normal, merchants said, but steady. Dipak Patel, the owner of a gas station in Parish, said he was running out of milk, bread and beer. Lori Lillie, who runs Lillie's diner on Main Street in Parish, watched Sunday as table after table ordered bowl after bowl of cream of broccoli soup. St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church on Cayuga Street also had a crowd. ''A lot of people walked all the way across town just to get here,'' said Phillip Kehoe, 51, a deacon. Despite a reprieve for most of Sunday, forecasters said they expected more snow late last night as well as Monday and Tuesday. A lake-effect snowstorm, in which cold, dry winds sweep across bodies of warmer lake water, was the cause of the powerful blast of snow, forecasters said, and is the usual cause of some of the area's heaviest snowfall. The official state record for snowfall from a single event is 10 feet 7 inches in Montague, in Lewis County, northeast of Oswego, from Dec. 26, 2001, to Jan. 1, 2002, said John Rozbicki, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Buffalo. He said that on Monday the Weather Service would begin a check of snowfall data from Redfield, including a review of radar results, before deciding whether the record had been broken. ''It could be that the snowfall total came from two separate events,'' Mr. Rozbicki said. ''We also have to check how often the person who took the measurements took the measurements, and how they were done.'' In Scriba, which received almost eight feet of snow, Joe Scozzari, 63, a lifelong resident, was clearing a path on the roof of his garage Sunday. ''I'm retired,'' he said with a shrug, holding his shovel. ''The exercise will do me good.'' He worked happily, but quickly. ''There's more snow coming,'' he said."
"As drivers dug themselves out from Wednesday's modest but messy snowstorm, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg found himself on the defensive over the city's decision not to suspend alternate-side parking rules. That move had residents complaining that their cars were ticketed after plows buried them in snow. The mayor was at times curt, testy and defensive as he answered questions from reporters at a Sanitation Department garage in Woodside, Queens, yesterday, even suggesting that New Yorkers stop ''griping'' about the situation. Mr. Bloomberg said the Sanitation Department had done ''a spectacular job'' of clearing the streets. There were ''a lot of fender-benders,'' he said, but no major accidents. ''We want to get the snow and ice off the roads as quickly as possible so emergency vehicles can get through, so that you can get to work, so that the kids can get to school,'' he said. ''And if we all do it together rather than griping, we'll be better off.'' But asking New Yorkers not to gripe is like asking for mayonnaise on a pastrami sandwich -- highly unlikely. Even if the situation did not approach the furor of February 1969, when parts of Queens were left unplowed for nearly a week after a crippling blizzard and Mayor John V. Lindsay bore the brunt of angry ridicule, complaints were prevalent yesterday, when the temperature ranged from 15 to 24 degrees. ''I have to dig out the car, and where am I going to put it?'' Carol Jolley, 50, asked in frustration. A stay-at-home mother in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, she used a garden shovel to excavate her Volvo sedan from a two-foot snow mound. ''Take a look around,'' she said. ''I have no place to put it. And then when I come back, this spot will be gone. All my good work for nothing.'' In prior years, Ms. Jolley maintained, the city usually relaxed parking rules the day after a storm. ''This is cruel and unusual punishment,'' she said. ''I've lived here all my life, and I don't remember them doing this so soon after a snow.'' Nearby, Eric Feldman, 50, a sound editor who was moving his Ford Explorer, said that enforcement of the rules served little purpose. ''It's going to make the roads more dangerous,'' he said, ''because you've got cars double-parked and some staying in place.'' In Forest Hills, Queens, Paul Goldfarb, 29, who works at Columbia University, said he woke up at 5:30 a.m. hoping the parking rules would be suspended. ''I was sort of incredulous that they hadn't been,'' he said. Another driver, Lois C. Schwartz, said, ''I'm 71 years old and I did somehow manage to extricate my car today, but not without great effort, thanks to the snowbank left by a plow.'' She said that ''travel was treacherous"" from her home in the West Village to Lincoln Center. ''And where were the plows yesterday afternoon?'' After a storm, the Sanitation and Transportation Departments jointly decide whether to suspend parking rules, and the mayor said that officials, seeking to expedite cleaning, ''deliberately did not suspend'' them for the two inches of snow. Asked about irritated drivers, Mr. Bloomberg said: ''They're going to enjoy it tomorrow when the streets are cleaner than they would have otherwise been. And this was not a lot of snow. It was easy to move your car. I don't like to get up early in the morning and have to do anything, either. I'd like to sleep in, too. But it was the right thing to do.'' The mayor, who typically takes the subway to work from his Upper East Side town house, dismissed complaints about the difficulty of moving cars. ''It wasn't like you had a couple of feet of snow, where you really couldn't physically move your car,'' he said. ''You had to put on galoshes and go out there and move it.'' Michael T. Delfin, 24, a photographer in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, said it was not so easy. It took him 20 minutes to move his Ford Explorer across the street. ''I cannot imagine what kind of city official would tell its residents, especially senior citizens and people with children, to go out on those unplowed ice sheets and move the car,'' he said. ''For street cleaning? Somebody call 311.'' Many did, flooding the city's 311 help line yesterday with questions about parking rules and school closings. (The city's schools were open.) The situation may ease with temperatures rising to the low 30s by tomorrow and no more snow in the immediate forecast. Every street with alternate-side rules was to be plowed twice, the mayor said. Along with its fleet of vehicles, the Sanitation Department used workers with shovels to clear the areas around crosswalks and bus stops. ''The department, I think, once again showed that it can handle anything Old Man Winter can throw at us,'' the mayor said, praising the sanitation workers behind him. By yesterday afternoon, the department had placed workers on 12-hour shifts, sent out more than 2,000 pieces of equipment, plowed all of the city's more than 5,000 miles of streets at least once and used about 50,000 of the 185,000 tons of salt on hand. ''Salt has been spread on 100 percent of the major roads, 96 percent of the secondary streets and 76 percent of the tertiary streets,'' the mayor declared. Mr. Bloomberg conceded that the patterns of the storm -- mild snow followed by freezing sleet and rain -- made the cleanup harder than usual. The plows are most effective, officials said, when at least two inches have accumulated. ''It probably would have been easier, actually, if we had six inches of snow,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''We probably could have plowed it right away.''"
"If a weather system can have impeccable timing, the one that brought more than two feet of snow to parts of northern New England this week arrived with the precision of an atomic clock. Owners of bed and breakfast inns, cross-country ski centers, snowmobile clubs and ski resorts that have been struggling from a dearth of snow this winter and last were ecstatic about having snow that was measurable in feet for the first time this season. That it happened just in time for the busiest week of the year was a bonus. ''The timing is absolutely perfect,'' said Jeff Wise, a spokesman at Stowe Mountain Resort in Stowe, Vt., which is expecting packed slopes this weekend. ''It comes on the fringe of Presidents' week, which is traditionally the busiest week of the whole winter.'' Bed and breakfast inns were also filling up quickly, with calls coming in Thursday as people dug themselves out. Scott and Carol Gould, owners of the Bethel Hill Bed and Breakfast in Bethel, Me., were stocking up on eggs for Scott's cinnamon-raisin French toast and quiche Lorraine, as their bed and breakfast was fully booked with winter sports enthusiasts for the first time this season. ''We're happy; we're thrilled,'' Ms. Gould said. ''I took a call at 10:30 last night, and now I'm completely booked for next week. When it snows, people pick up the phone.'' Doug Garland, owner of the Bear Notch Ski Touring Center in Bartlett, N.H., said that business at his center was down 40 percent this year and that he hoped this storm would salvage the season. The phones were ringing on Wednesday and Thursday with people checking on the snow accumulation. Snowmobilers who had become accustomed to looking at rocky, dirt-strewn trails this winter were gassing up their vehicles. ''The phone hasn't stopped ringing,'' said Bob Meyers, executive director of the Maine Snowmobile Association. ''Everybody on the planet is descending upon Maine this weekend.'' ''This is the best news for all kinds of folks in a long time,'' Mr. Meyers added. ''You can literally hop on a snowmobile in southern Maine and ride to the northern tip with excellent conditions everywhere. It's been several years since you could do that.'' Meteorologists at the National Weather Service in Gray, Me., were not sure when was the last time there was such a large storm. But Mr. Wise at the Stowe resort remembers Feb. 14, 2001, six years to the day of Wednesday's storm. ''I had it all planned out to get engaged to my wife,'' he said, ''and I got stranded at work, at the mountain.'' But Mr. Wise made it home in time to propose while it was still Valentine's Day."
"The lodge here at what bills itself as the world's highest ski resort has fraying black-and-white photos evoking memories of the years when this country had an Olympic ski team. Bolivia's die-hard skiers still boast about the place, asking where else one can ski above the clouds at a dizzying 17,388 feet with a view of Lake Titicaca on the horizon. Where else, they ask, would the apr√®s-ski tradition include coca tea and soup made from the grain of the quinoa plant? Their pride in the ski resort here, the only one in Bolivia, soon gives way to a grim acceptance that the glacier that once surrounded the lodge with copious amounts of snow and ice is melting fast. Attributing the melting to the growing emission of greenhouse gases causing global warming, scientists say Bolivia's skiing tradition could be extinguished when Chacaltaya's modest ski run disappears forever in a few years. ''This is a tragedy I can hardly bear to witness,'' said Franz Guti√©rrez, 65, who has been a member of the Bolivian Andean Club, which operates Chacaltaya, since he was a teenager. Guiding a group of about a dozen skiers on the opening day of this year's season, Mr. Guti√©rrez reminisced about how he skied nearly every weekend until Chacaltaya's glacier began melting significantly a decade ago. ''It is magical,'' he said, ''to ski at an altitude at which planes don't fly in parts of the world.'' Chacaltaya, of course, never had the glamour of a Vail or a Zermatt. Founded in the late 1930s by a dreamer named Ra√∫l Posnansky Lipmann, it can be reached only by a dirt road winding through the chaotic markets of El Alto, a sprawling city of slums above La Paz, and with nail-biting-inducing switchbacks that lack guardrails. Though ski resorts in Chile and Argentina thrive during the South American winter, from July to September, the best skiing at Chacaltaya is -- or rather, was -- from about January through March, when snow and hail are somewhat more common here. After Mr. Posnansky died in an avalanche in the 1940s little was done to alter Chacaltaya's spartan operations. Its lift, which stopped working recently, was powered by an old automobile engine. Now skiers must hike 30 minutes to Chacaltaya's only run. For those not acclimated to La Paz, the capital, much less to Chacaltaya, which is about a mile higher, that effort intensifies the splitting headaches and shortness of breath that afflict visitors to such heights. ''I thought training at this altitude would offer some advantages,'' said Jos√© Manuel Bejarano Carvajal, 50, a member of the team that competed in the Winter Olympics in Sarajevo in 1984. ''But I finished last.'' Mr. Bejarano said Bolivia was represented in the Olympics as recently as 1992, before its team was disbanded. He and other members of the Bolivian Andean Club, which operates from a building in downtown La Paz whose facades are sprayed with graffiti, have followed the studies of their disappearing snow with alarm. Scientists say that glaciers are increasingly receding throughout the Andes, but that Chacaltaya's melting has been especially quick. More than 80 percent of the glacier has been lost in 20 years, said Jaime Argollo Bautista, director of the Institute of Geological Investigation at the University of San Andr√©s, in La Paz. ''I would give Chacaltaya three more years,'' said Mr. Argollo, adding that the relatively small size of the glacier and the abundance of rocks under its ice, which easily absorb heat, have quickened its retreat. Beyond the impact on skiing, the pastime of only a small elite in Bolivia, Mr. Argollo said, the country's receding glaciers threaten drinking water supplies and water for hydroelectric plants that supply power to La Paz and El Alto. ''Chacaltaya is but a preview of what's to happen to our other glaciers,'' Mr. Argollo said. Bolivia's skiers seem to approach the impending end at Chacaltaya with a mixture of denial and resignation. Some members of the Andean Club talk of transforming their lodge into a gymnasium where mountain climbers and other athletes could adapt to high altitudes. This would involve redesigning the club's proud emblem, a condor on skis. Others dream of bringing in artificial snow, a prohibitively expensive solution here in South America's poorest country, or of building a new lodge on nearby Mount Mururata, which still has ample snow so far, an idea limited by terrible road access. Humor helps those who have frequented Chacaltaya most of their adult life. Alfredo Mart√≠nez, 72, a sprightly former skier and mountain climber, said global warming had nothing to do with the snow's disappearance. Mr. Mart√≠nez said it was because ''Bolivia's women have grown too mischievous.'' He did not explain his joke further, and the younger women who had come for the first day of skiing this year were not amused. Some skiers continue trekking to the only remaining ski slope here to get a few runs in before Chacaltaya surrenders its claim to being the world's highest ski area to peaks like Jade Dragon Snow Mountain in China, Gulmarg in the Indian Himalayas or Tochal in Iran. ''Let's just say this place is unique,'' Darrel Nitshe, 41, a Canadian who works for a skiing outfit that brings people to the tops of ski runs in British Columbia by helicopter, said as he stopped to catch his breath on the trek to the summit here, which is surrounded by the snowcapped peaks of the Andes. But there are some who seemingly refuse to admit that the end is near. Angelo Mart√≠nez, 22, a dentistry student in La Paz, took no fewer than four runs on his snowboard on Sunday, climbing to the top after each descent as if he were ascending a flight of stairs at sea level. ''There's no place I'd rather be,'' Mr. Mart√≠nez said, squinting as the sun beat down on the lonely slope. ''At least Chacaltaya is ours.'' CHACALTAYA JOURNAL"
"Like Albert Einstein, like Isaac Newton, like Thomas Edison, Mark Noonan had an idea. Actually, like them, he had lots of ideas, though most of them never got past his sketchbooks. But one of them might, in its own small way, make history. So before the snow melts away, while we bid winter adieu here on the first full day of spring, let us praise Mr. Noonan. A throwback to the glory days of American ingenuity, a swimmer against the tide, he's the inventor of the Wovel, the iPod of snow shovels. The Wovel (rhymes with shovel), looks like one of those high-wheeled 19th-century bicycles incongruously transported to that pile of snow in the driveway. It relies on two simple principles of physics, the wheel and the lever, to revolutionize the humble art of shoveling snow -- at least the part that hasn't been revolutionized out of existence by the plow guy who does it for you. For those of us who actually take pride in getting rid of snow ourselves, the Wovel really is something new. It acts as a lever using as its fulcrum the axis of a wheel three feet in diameter. A shovel blade 26 inches wide and 18 inches deep and a handle extend in opposite directions from the wheel's hub. Rather than bending down and using your back to lift and throw 30 pounds of snow, you simply push the snow along, as if pushing a baby carriage, and then push the handle down, throwing the snow wherever you like. Think of pushing down on a seesaw with snow on the other end. A study at the University of Massachusetts found back strain from the Wovel is roughly akin to walking, reducing the risk of lower-back injury from shoveling snow by 85 percent. This is not insignificant in that the Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that nearly 76,000 people a year are treated for injuries from shoveling and blowing snow, not to mention the deaths from heart attacks. And it's a way to get rid of snow without burning fossil fuel. (It's available at the Web site Wovel.com and online from retailers like Hammacher Schlemmer and Home Depot.) ''It's the most amazing machine,'' said Richard Lechner, 53, a dentist in New Britain, Conn., who spent much of the winter cursing the blue sky and wishing for snow so he could use his new Wovel. ''The most astonishing thing is that someone didn't come up with this 50 years ago. All it is is a wheel, a handle and a snow shovel, but it makes shoveling snow at least 10 times easier.'' Mr. Noonan's march to Woveldom began with a bad back. A tinkerer as a kid, he was a physics major in college who then switched to economics in search of something more ''practical.'' But even after going to work on Wall Street, he continued to come up with ideas for tangible products. In 2000, while nursing a bad back, pushing his shovel with his knee rather than lifting, he began thinking of the physics of snow shoveling. How could you create leverage, he thought. After contemplating and abandoning a two-wheeled approach, he built a one-wheel prototype out of sheet metal, sheet metal screws and (what else?) duct tape. He took it to the backyard and was stunned how well it worked. At first, Mr. Noonan's notion was just to have something to clear the skating rink he built in his backyard, but soon he began to think of the Wovel as a commercial product. A serious bout of cancer a year later put that off, and partly because of that, he eventually figured, why not act on this one? In 2003, he quit his job on Wall Street churning out abstruse financial products and decided to see if he could churn out real ones instead. Will the Wovel change the world? Who knows? It looks weird, it requires people to try something new and it must be assembled. For some -- not all -- users it takes a little of practice, like learning to ride a bicycle. At about $120 it's a lot less than a snow blower, but a lot more than the average shovel. Still, Time magazine named it one of its best inventions of 2006, it's been praised by Popular Mechanics and was named one of the Top 10 picks at the International Hardware Show in 2006. Mr. Noonan has sold about 15,000 so far, a number that surely would have been higher had there been more snow the past two winters. He just needs to hope climate change doesn't put him out of business. OUR TOWNS E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com"
"THE WHITE CASCADE The Great Northern Railway Disaster and America's Deadliest Avalanche. By Gary Krist. Illustrated. 315 pp. Henry Holt & Company. $26. Natural disasters follow a script in America, a maddening, though some might argue reassuring, drama that taps into our puritanical righteousness, our legacy of entitlement and our compulsion to right wrongs with regulatory legislation. Whether a hurricane is to blame or a blizzard, as in ''The White Cascade: The Great Northern Railway Disaster and America's Deadliest Avalanche,'' by Gary Krist, our outrage in retrospect seems matched only by our lack of foresight at the time. Set in 1910 on elegant Pullmans and drab boxcars held hostage by snow in the Cascade mountains, Krist's account of an avalanche -- which struck early on the morning of March 1 and killed 96 men, women and children -- resonates because the particulars of such national tragedies have not, in fact, changed much. The Great Northern Railway's Cascade line, completed in 1893, was considered a marvel. The switchbacks and tunnels that cut through the snowiest region in the lower 48 were the handiwork of John F. Stevens, who would later become chief engineer of the Panama Canal. For the first time, Seattle, Spokane and Everett were efficiently connected to the rest of the country, allowing mail and other goods to travel from St. Paul to Seattle in just under 48 hours. Watching over this line was James O'Neill, a 37-year-old golden boy whose career on the rails started at age 13. He became a favorite of the Great Northern's owner, James J. Hill, a tycoon who once said, ''Give me enough Swedes and whiskey and I'll build a railroad to hell.'' O'Neill had been superintendent of the division for three years when, at the end of February 1910, an enormous snowstorm socked in the mountains, and he was forced to shut down the line until the weather improved. Six trains were on the tracks, but O'Neill's main concern quickly became the two already deep in the Cascades, the time-sensitive Fast Mail train and the stately Seattle Express. Weather, Krist notes, was not the only villain here. As the hours and days passed, telegraph lines snapped and coal supplies dwindled. There were honest miscalculations, good intentions gone awry and corporate hubris aplenty, giving the story complexity and relevance. Krist was fortunate with the cast of characters aboard these trains -- stogie-smoking gents, an imperious dowager, a young and fashionable hair-care entrepreneur, an intrepid female journalist, a handful of adorable children -- but he doesn't use them to full effect. He's a novelist and short-story writer, but in this, his first nonfiction book, he restrains his imaginative powers somewhat. He is hesitant to recreate scenes even when the story's lagging pace begs for a bit of embellishment, and even though his source material -- diaries, passengers' letters and transcripts from the coroner's official report -- would seem to support some license. Krist rarely budges from his admirable detachment, and, as a result, portions of the narrative drag. Wisely, though, Krist puts O'Neill at the center of the story: a man of swift and earnest action and company loyalty. Still, this is a case of disaster compounded by bad choices, and one that brought to light hidden agendas among the powerful, as well as the diffuse anxieties and suspicions Americans felt toward the industry titans of their time. Class warfare and bigotry emerged in the avalanche's wake. Newspapers stoked gruesome rumors, one involved starving crew members killing and eating a cat. Years later, events were rehashed in lawsuits. But for all the emotional familiarity of the tragedy and its aftermath, the victims are anachronisms. They are evidence that Americans have devolved in terms of civility, stoicism and patience. Most were too polite, too adaptable to make too much fuss. Though, one group did gather signatures for a petition requesting a meeting with O'Neill, who was too busy dickering with snowplows to oblige. And some passengers managed to hike down off the mountain before the avalanche struck. O'Neill tried to shoulder the burden himself, but his commendable work ethic prevented him from evacuating the trains. Everyone on the mountain that week had a faith in man and machine so complete that they were willing to endure days in claustrophobic quarters among toddlers and the infirm and drinking polluted snow water. Paradoxically, it is precisely our modern propensity for impatience and aggression, our tendency to freak out and then blame others, that could have saved these well-behaved men, women and children. Aren't we too rude and cynical to stand for such shenanigans from Amtrak? Certainly the hundreds who died waiting bravely for assistance in New Orleans could belie that point. Or prove it, perhaps. Louise Jarvis Flynn has written about adventure and sports for Women's Sports & Fitness and other magazines."
"A harsh winter storm marked by a mixture of snow, sleet and freezing rain descended on the Northeast early yesterday, burying parts of the region in damp snow, halting air traffic at many airports and stranding thousands of travelers. The storm, which began late Thursday with freezing rain that turned into snow, caught the region off guard, arriving after several days of unseasonably warm weather. As temperatures fell yesterday, as much as 7 inches of wet snow was deposited in parts of New Jersey, while parts of Connecticut got 6 inches, and 1.5 inches fell in Central Park. The wintry assault frustrated efforts to stay on schedule at airports in the New York metropolitan area and prompted nearly every major airline to delay or cancel flights. By late yesterday, more than 2,500 flights had been canceled throughout the Northeast, with JetBlue scrapping all of its flights out of Newark, La Guardia and Kennedy International Airports. Other major airlines halted several hundred each. Many were scrapped for precautionary reasons, but the cancellations brought the three airports to a near standstill and forced passengers to watch in dismay as their travel plans were disrupted. Many of the airlines began slashing flights early yesterday and notifying passengers in advance. ''It's a pain,'' said Eli Gold, 17, a high school student from Piedmont, Calif., who was staying in New York with 16 other students for a conference and was told early yesterday morning that his 8 p.m. flight had been canceled. ''We were supposed to fly back today and our flight got canceled until Saturday night,'' he said. ''Even though it's kind of awful that we're stranded, we're taking advantage of it and trying to see New York and enjoy ourselves.'' The precipitation prompted the National Weather Service to issue storm warnings for every part of the region except for Suffolk County, on Long Island, and parts of Connecticut, where warm air currents from the Atlantic Ocean prevented any snow accumulation. As the storm swept through the region yesterday, it created major road delays. The hazardous conditions were blamed for the deaths of at least five people in traffic accidents in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The weather also forced school cancellations , prompted government agencies to send workers home early and led some highway agencies to warn motorists not to drive above 35 miles per hour. The National Weather Service said yesterday that the brunt of the storm would hit the region last night and that precipitation would end by this evening. By late last night, US Airways said it had scrapped 1,217 of its scheduled 3,700 flights, Delta Air Lines had canceled 600 of its 4,100 flights and Continental had canceled 175 of about 1,100 flights on its bigger jets. Jenny Dervin, a spokeswoman for JetBlue, said that, for this storm, the airline had canceled flights early. On Feb. 14, JetBlue was widely criticized as having waited too long to do so amid an ice storm, leaving passengers stranded on planes on the tarmac at Kennedy Airport. ''We contacted customers at home,'' she said. ''Today is how you do it.'' At Newark Airport, Karen Opdyke, 48, was trying to get to Miami for a cruise with her husband, three young children and mother after their 9 a.m. flight was canceled. ''We got on the plane, we got off the plane,'' she told The Associated Press. ''We got on the plane and off the plane.'' As she balanced a crying child next to a pile of luggage, Ms. Opdyke said that she could not book another flight and that JetBlue agents were unable to help her make a reservation on a different airline. ''There's nothing available all week,'' she said. At Philadelphia International Airport, 95 percent of flights were canceled after ice pellets forced several airlines to ground their planes, said Phyllis Van Istendal, a spokeswoman for the airport. Thousands of passengers were stranded at several Philadelphia terminals, and officials at the airport began distributing pillows and blankets to passengers who planned to spend the night. With all the hotels around the airport completely booked by yesterday afternoon, Ms. Van Istendal said she was expecting several hundred stranded passengers to camp out. There were also aggravations on the runways. Passengers on nine US Airways planes were trapped on board for as many as five hours after the planes failed to take off because of the weather and got stuck on the tarmac. Valerie Wunder, a US Airways spokeswoman, said the passengers had been trapped because of the severe congestion at the airport. ''We didn't have any place to put the airplanes,'' she said."
"Since at least the 19th century, people have periodically claimed to see giant snowflakes falling from the sky -- big ones the size of saucers and plates or even larger, their edges turned up, their heaviness making them descend faster than small flakes. But the evidence was always sketchy and, because of the fragile nature of snowflakes, fleeting. The giant flakes were not quite in the category of sea monsters or U.F.O.'s. Even so, skeptics noted the human fondness for exaggeration, as well as the lack of convincing photographs. And the organizations that compile weather records never made tracking big flakes an observational requirement. So the giants languished in a twilight world of science, their existence claimed but seldom documented. Now, theorists, weather historians and field observers are concluding that most of the reports are true and that unusually large snowflakes two to six inches wide and perhaps wider fall regularly around the globe, surprisingly big and fluffy, if seldom witnessed or celebrated. Guinness World Records lists the largest snowflakes as having fallen during a storm in January 1887 at Fort Keogh, in Montana. A rancher nearby, the book says, called them ''larger than milk pans'' and measured one at 15 inches wide. But no corroborating evidence supports the claim. ''Who of us has seen a hailstone the size of a golf ball or a baseball?'' asked Kenneth G. Libbrecht, a snowflake devotee at the California Institute of Technology who runs the physics department there in his spare time. ''But, clearly, they exist, because people pull them out of their freezers. Some of these things can be very, very rare, but not impossible.'' So too with giant snowflakes, Dr. Libbrecht said. ''As big as a basketball?'' he asked. ''Who knows? It's not out of the question.'' The laws of physics, he said, suggest no obvious restrictions on the size of very large flakes. But in the real world, Dr. Libbrecht added, wind might break up the fragile compilations, putting an effective size limit on what flutters down from the sky. Some of the new interest stems from weather historians who have scrutinized old reports and found recurring claims of giant snowflakes. At times, they say, independent observers of the same storm have corroborated the extraordinary falls. William S. Pike, a British weather observer for the Royal Meteorological Society, found 11 poorly known reports, which he described in The Journal of Meteorology in January 1988. He wrote that reliable observers of big flakes estimated their diameters at anywhere from two to six inches. ''There is every reason to suppose that such instances might occur almost every day during winter somewhere in Europe or the maritime fringes of North America and Asia,'' he said. But, he added, such extraordinary snowfalls ''are seldom reported or authenticated.'' In an interview, Mr. Pike said he got into the topic partly because he himself watched in amazement one day in Vancouver, British Columbia, as giant snowflakes began to transform the winter landscape. ''They were two or three inches across,'' he recalled. ''So I became a believer, having once witnessed it myself.'' He added that scientists were starting to understand the atmospheric conditions that give rise to big flakes and that this knowledge presented an opportunity for enthusiastic amateurs. ''Any kid with a ruler and a camera can make a contribution,'' he said. ''If they see something special, it's worth recording and talking about. After all, records are meant to be broken.'' More by accident than design, scientific field studies in recent years have begun to document the existence of very large flakes with laser probes that can make precise measurements. Two expeditions in the Canadian wilds have done so from airplanes flying through heavy winter storms. In the future, NASA and its international partners are to join the hunt for giant snowflakes with satellites that measure global precipitation, including snowfall. The work is seen as crucial for climate studies. The first satellite is to fly in 2013, at an overall mission cost of roughly $1 billion. ''For the fist time, we'll be able to make a good estimate of the snowfall rate and potentially of snowflake sizes, including the presence of very large flakes,'' said Walter A. Petersen, a senior research scientist at the University of Alabama, Huntsville, who is working on what is known as the Global Precipitation Measurement mission. ''It's a big deal.'' Dr. Petersen said understanding snowflake sizes and shapes was important because big ones, if unaccounted for in the global measurements, could fool space sensors into overestimating the amount of precipitation. The usual image of a snowflake -- a perfect star with six arms, the kind found on ski sweaters and holiday cards -- is actually a single snow crystal. As Dr. Libbrecht of Caltech notes in his book ''The Snowflake'' (Voyageur Press, 2003), the word snowflake is a general term that can refer to a single ice crystal, a small cluster of them or a large aggregation that forms when crystals ''collide and stick in midair, falling to earth in a flimsy puffball.'' Hundreds or perhaps thousands of crystals will come together to form a giant snowflake, scientists say. But it turns out that even a single crystal can be surprisingly large. Dr. Libbrecht, who grew up on a farm in North Dakota and fell in love with snow at an early age, now specializes in studying and photographing snow crystals. In an interview, he mentioned how in his 2003 book he described the biggest snow crystals found in nature as about the size of a pea. After that, he said, he was on field study in northern Ontario when he found himself surrounded by star-shaped crystals falling from the sky that were the size of dimes. ''They were huge,'' he recalled. ''It was very impressive.'' Dr. Libbrecht features one of the giants in ''Ken Libbrecht's Field Guild to Snowflakes'' (Voyageur Press, 2006). ''It's quite a sight,'' he wrote, ''to see such enormous ice flowers drifting through the air and landing on your sleeve!'' (In his laboratory, he has managed to grow single crystals even larger, up to an inch wide.) Snow crystals, despite their legendary diversity, come in a relatively small number of general shapes, including prisms, columns, stars, cups, plates, bullets and needles. Technically, the big crystals that Dr. Libbrecht observed in Canada are known as dendrites, from the Greek word for tree, because their arms are quite elaborate, like branches thick with leaves or flower stems rich in petals. Dendrites are the largest snow crystals. Scientists have found that dendrites have a tendency to join together faster than their simpler relatives. Their complicated arms, it appears, more easily form bonds. ''As the branches interlock,'' said Dr. Petersen of the University of Alabama, ''you get these huge aggregates.'' Scientists have also found that particularly large dendrites, like the ones Dr. Libbrecht observed, can become the ''seeds'' or ''nuclei'' from which big flakes grow. Mr. Pike's article in The Journal of Meteorology mentions the rancher's giant Montana flakes, but finds that report questionable. The rest of his cases tend to be better documented and corroborated, often by meteorologists. For instance, weather officials in Berlin reported a winter storm of January 1915 that produced snowflakes up to four inches wide. The big flakes, German officials said in The Meteorologischen Zeitschrift, ''not only fell more rapidly than the small flakes, but also did not swirl about to the same extent.'' The officials added that ''most were shaped like round or oval bowls or dishes with upturned rims. They did rock to and fro in the wind but at no time were they observed to turn over completely so that the concave side would face downward.'' Mr. Pike also reports on a winter storm that hit Laramie, Wyo., in September 1970, producing flakes up to three inches wide. A witness watched two relatively small flakes collide and merge to form a large snowflake. Using a stopwatch, the observer also found that the big flakes fell more than twice as fast as smaller ones. Mr. Pike, generalizing from the reports, concluded that the big flakes tended to form when the temperature was just above freezing, making them wet and sticky. ''Ideally,'' he wrote, ''winds should also be relatively light to avoid 'bunches' disintegrating.'' The agglomerations seem to start relatively high in the atmosphere, Mr. Pike added. When flakes of modest size form, he said, ''there is a fair likelihood that these will continue to grow by collision and merger, especially at the expense of smaller flakes and crystals falling in their paths at two-thirds or half the speed.'' An airborne expedition near St. John's, Newfoundland, went further in illuminating the origin of the big flakes. The work began during a fierce storm in February 1992 as scientists of the Canadian Atlantic Storms Program tried to understand the nature of winter gales that lash the coast. Suddenly, a laser on the side of the plane began to track the presence of snow crystals up to a fifth of an inch wide -- about the size of a pea. The team made measurements all over the region and then, back on the ground, found that large snowflakes up to two inches wide were falling and collected samples. After compiling all the weather data and doing extensive computer modeling, the team came up with a detailed explanation. The drama had begun more than three miles up -- unusually high -- when large dendrites formed in moist winds that blew slightly upward, keeping the crystals aloft. ''That gave them time to grow,'' recalled R. Paul Lawson, a team scientist then working at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, in Boulder, Colo. ''And it let them fall for a long time.'' Eventually, the big crystals fell through a region of regular snowfall, Dr. Lawson said, bumping into smaller dendrites and needles along the way, gathering them up to form increasingly large clusters. ''As they fell, they tended to accumulate,'' he said. ''Everything has to come together for it to work.'' The team published its findings, ''Observations and Numerical Simulations of the Origin and Development of Very Large Snowflakes,'' in the November 1998 issue of The Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences. Herbert H. Close Jr., an amateur weather observer in Manchester, Md., knows the magic up close. One night last winter, amid bolts of blue lightning and peals of thunder, he watched in astonishment as giant flakes began to fall around him. They were so big that the surrounding snow cover turned lumpy. ''It's a matter of being at the right place at the right time,'' Mr. Close said of the unusual show. ''Sometimes you get lucky.''"
"IT was the inaugural meeting of the Westchester Global Warming Task Force, and there was clearly no need to schedule a snow day. As the 34-member committee gathered to discuss climate change, the temperature kept creeping up. By afternoon, when the mercury registered 70, the record was set for the warmest January day in Westchester since 1895, when records were first kept. While the group -- made up of local government officials, educators, environmentalists and representatives from the business community -- set to work in a White Plains conference room on Jan. 6, other local residents hit the golf courses, biked around the Kensico Dam, picnicked and otherwise enjoyed the balmy weather. I had just returned from a vacation in the tropics and was bracing myself for winter's chill. Instead, I pulled my shorts out of the suitcase and went hiking. Even if you are no fan of snow and ice, this elongated break from winter weather is giving most of us an uneasy feeling. You cannot quite enjoy it because you know something is up. No matter where you fall on the Michael Crichton-Al Gore scale (global warming is not real, versus batten down the hatches, we are in serious trouble), you cannot argue that this has been a normal winter so far. The numbers do not lie. On Wednesday, the Hudson Valley Weather Observers, a group that has recorded local temperatures every day for decades, held its bimonthly meeting to report its findings. Not only was December nine degrees above normal on average, but there was no measurable snowfall and not one day that the temperature dipped into the single digits, said Dr. Jerome Thaler, who has been monitoring temperatures in Yorktown for more than 40 years. Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute estimate that 2006 was the fifth-warmest year on earth since modern records have been kept. And those experts do not waffle as to the cause: a buildup of man-made carbon dioxide. So you might wonder why a small county like Westchester thinks it can make a dent in the problem of rising temperatures across the globe. Can a town supervisor in North Castle (that is Reese Berman, the co-chairwoman of the task force) actually end up having an impact on whether polar bears in the Arctic have enough ice to maintain their habitat? Well, this may be one of those times when the expression ''Think globally, act locally'' actually does resonate. Certainly the county's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions cannot hurt. The task force, whose first meeting was organizational, plans to identify practical steps that can be taken on a local level to address the problem. One of its first efforts will be to update exactly how much greenhouse gas Westchester has produced. In 1999, the county produced almost 12 million tons of carbon dioxide. ''This is an enormous amount,'' County Executive Andrew Spano said. ''While it is lower than estimates for some other New York counties in the same period, it is higher than the state average at the time of 11.8 tons. And even that state average is way too high.'' Transportation accounted for about 51 percent of the 12 million tons, residential use was roughly 30 percent and the commercial sector about 19 percent. The task force will set goals to reduce those emissions over the next decade and develop strategies on how to get there. They also plan on recommending a sustainable development program for Westchester. This includes everything from ''green'' (environmentally friendly) construction, using alternative energy sources, converting to more energy-efficient uses, reducing waste and water consumption, recycling, focusing on transportation and fuel alternatives, and looking at land-use plans and legislation. ''People need to take this seriously,'' Mr. Spano said. ''There are local governments across the whole country that are involved in this, because the federal government isn't showing any leadership.'' John Hall, the newly elected congressman who represents the Hudson Valley, said that he and his colleagues were startled to see the cherry blossoms in bloom during their recent inauguration, and that global warming was the talk of the new freshman class. But even without direction from Washington, if local governments switch to hybrid cars, and local businesses use less heating oil, and schools install energy-efficient light bulbs, and hundreds of other small steps are taken in thousands of municipalities, it would be a start. Of course, despite warming trends, the daytime temperature did dip into the 30's last week and we could still get snow this week. I think most of us are ready. ''I took a walk last Saturday and it felt like spring,'' Ms. Berman said. ''But it was an odd sort of day. People felt happy it was so warm and scared at the same time. It's not like you feel about spring after a long winter. That's joyous. This is a different feeling.''"
"Yesterday, Jan. 10, a date that will live in meteorological history, snow flurries were glimpsed in Central Park for the first time this winter. The previous record for the latest recorded snowfall was Jan. 4, 1878, when President Rutherford B. Hayes discussed with his Cabinet the possible minting of silver dollars. The first snow yesterday, a chilly, blustery day, follows a period of unusual warmth throughout the Northeast and especially in New York City. A shift in the jet stream, which carries frigid air from the Arctic Circle, appears to have spared the region the usual winter storms so far, meteorologists say. For the record, flurries fell in the park at 9:55 a.m., when the temperature was 33 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. It was over in less than 15 minutes. New Jersey got more snow, with Newark Liberty International Airport reporting a total of 0.1 inch. Brian Ciemnecki, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's station in Upton, on Long Island, said, ''You can still get snow flurries at 33, even 34 and 35 degrees.'' No snow is in the forecast, until perhaps Tuesday, he said. Were there any instances yesterday of toddlers sticking their tongues out and letting snow flakes melt? ''Not that I know of,'' he said."
"New England's fickle weather has been the subject of many jokes, and it seemed to be playing one last week on Yankee magazine, the longtime chronicler of all things quaint and folksy in the region. Yankee introduced a new format in its latest issue, which arrived on newsstands Jan. 9 with a big cover story about the glories of snow. The wintry scene depicted was all the more prominent because the magazine, which shrank to digest size during World War II to conserve paper, had grown to full size. But New England has been outright warm this winter, along with most of the Northeast. It was a record 67 degrees on Jan. 6 in Portland, Me., for example, and even the snowiest parts of northern Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire have seen relatively little of the stuff, according to the National Weather Service. In a telephone interview Thursday, Mel Allen, the recently named editor of Yankee, pre-empted the question. ''You're going to kid with me about not having any snow,'' he said. The cover photo and story package were selected last summer, Mr. Allen said. ''Who would have suggested Jan. 11 we wouldn't have had a significant snowfall yet?'' he said. The current Yankee was the January/February issue, he pointed out, adding that there was still time for plenty of blizzards. ''I'm betting that we're going to get socked,'' he said. Still, at a recent planning meeting for next year's winter issue, some story ideas were rejiggered to be mindful of the fact that the winter of 2008 could be mild, too, Mr. Allen said. As for readers, Yankee has been swamped by letters, phone calls and e-mail messages -- the vast majority of them about the publication's new format. ''Yankee has been passed down like an heirloom from generation to generation, and it's always had this idiosyncratic size,'' Mr. Allen said. Yankee wasn't the only magazine to introduce design changes this month and trip slightly over long lead times. The Atlantic -- which, like Yankee, is placing new emphasis on photography -- ran a calendar item noting that Saddam Hussein might hang in February (it happened in late December). James Bennet, editor of The Atlantic, said by telephone Friday, ''There is a degree of prophecy that's involved in this kind of work.'' JENNIFER A. KINGSON MEDIA TALK"
"The last recorded time the snowfall in Central Park came so late in the season, the date was Jan. 4, 1878. Rutherford B. Hayes was president, the tallest building in the city was Trinity Church (281 feet), and there was no Statue of Liberty. (It was erected in 1886.) In a sense, there was no New York, either. The boroughs consolidated in 1898. Before then, the Bronx was called the Annexed District, Queens was farms, Staten Island was nearly empty, and Brooklyn was the nation's third-largest city. Yesterday, with parts of the nation shivering and the Rockies and the Midwest pummeled by another snowstorm, the record for the latest appearance of snow in New York City was broken with little fanfare. For now, not even a flurry is in the immediate forecast. Indeed, today the temperature might reach 71 degrees, which would be another record. According to the National Weather Service, it will not even come close to freezing until Tuesday night, when the temperature could go down to 30 degrees. For many people interviewed yesterday -- a warm day of mist and gray skies -- the city without snow was both a bewilderment and a delight. There was scarcely a fedora, a knit cap or a hoodie to be seen. Therese Kahn, an interior decorator on the Upper East Side, was wearing what she described as ''comfortable'' Stuart Weitzman patent-leather boots, rather than Gore-Tex snow boots. ''It's amazing that it's so nice,'' said Ms. Kahn, 50, who also had on a thin white parka, unzipped. ''I have two teenage daughters and I'm always worried that they're not dressed warmly enough, so this lifts the pressure.'' Jan Khan, 53, has been a doorman at 88 Central Park West for 21 years. ''This is the first year I see no snow coming down,'' he said. ''I don't like it. It's not normal.'' Mr. Khan, originally from Mansehra, in northern Pakistan, said winter was invading usually warmer countries of Asia. On Thursday, more than 30 people were reported dead in Madhya Pradesh, in central India, and at least 20 in Bihar, in northeastern India, because of a severe cold snap. ''In Pakistan that is the problem now,'' Mr. Khan said. ''Two feet, three feet of snow. The Arctic is happening in my country, and India and Bangladesh and Nepal and China, all under snow.'' In East Harlem, at the Three Kings Day Parade, which commemorates the arrival of the Magi in Bethlehem, Carlos Canales, 36, from Glendale, Queens, worried about the weather. ''People aren't really ready for the winter anymore,'' he said. ''We're going to get caught off guard when winter finally hits us and a lot of people are going to get sick.'' Nearby, in Central Park, Patrick Denehan, 36, a furniture mover from Washington Heights, sipped coffee and watched geese waddle near an ice-free Harlem Meer. ''It feels,'' Mr. Denehan said, ''like the Twilight Zone.'' There is one positive aspect to the warm weather: the pothole situation. The city's Department of Transportation said that work crews paved 17,357 potholes last month, about a quarter fewer than the 22,685 during the much snowier December of 2005. In December 1877, when The New York Times took note of the snowless Christmas, the day was described as crisp and sunny. The headline said, ''A MILD CHRISTMAS DAY -- THOUSANDS OF PERSONS IN THE CENTRAL PARK.'' The Times account read, ''It is estimated, and the estimate is thought to be moderate, that fully 50,000 persons were in the Park during the afternoon, nearly all of whom visited the new Museum, opened by the President on Saturday.'' The Times noted, however, that the weather did hurt certain businesses. ''Dry-goods houses, clothiers and coal dealers have been the heaviest sufferers,'' the newspaper said. ''They have seen their Winter's supplies lie on their hands almost undiminished.'' When snow finally fell for the first time that winter in Central Park on Jan. 4, 1878, The Times did not report it. The newspaper did say that Poughkeepsie had four inches of snow. The National Weather Service was cautious yesterday about how snowless is snowless. Jeffrey Tongue, science and operations officer at the service's Upton office on Long Island, said the Jan. 4, 1878, date is based on the best available records. ''When we're talking about a snow flurry that might last 10 minutes,'' Mr. Tongue said, ''there's a question whether those were fully documented. We believe the 1878 date is accurate, but of course there's nobody alive to actually ask about it.'' Stephen Fybish, an amateur weather historian, contends that the record for late snow in Central Park occurred far later than 1878, indeed nearly a century later, on Jan. 29, 1973. ''This is also true,'' said Mr. Tongue of the weather service. ''The 1878 date is for a trace of snow, which doesn't stick to the ground, and the 1973 date is for measurable snow, which was 1.8 inches.'' So, whether the start date for the snowless record should be Jan. 5 or Jan. 30 is a matter of keen scholarly interest. But, please, the weather service urges, no wagering."
"No children screeching on toboggans. No thwack against a friend's head. No melting on tongues. No snow. November. December, too. For the last two months, no snow has fallen on Central Park, and it probably won't fall anytime soon, forecasters say. Indeed, not since April 8 has there been even a flurry. The National Weather Service said that last month appeared to be the first December without a snowflake here since 1877, when Rutherford B. Hayes was president. Moreover, New York City is not alone. Warsaw, Budapest, Berlin, Vienna and Stockholm report little or no snow this season. It has been so warm in Yaroslavl, a city about 150 miles northeast of Moscow, that Masha the bear, a resident of the city zoo, woke up last month from his hibernation after only a week. In Central Park on Saturday, where children were gliding along on roller skates and rumbling around on three-wheelers, Rob Flanagan, 35, a general contractor from Hoboken, N.J., was peeved. ''Global warming!'' he said. ''Al might be right!'' Mr. Flanagan was referring to Al Gore, the former vice president and crusader against greenhouse gases. The mild weather stinks, he said. ''I like the snow!'' Stuart Welburn, a lawyer who lives on the Upper West Side, disagreed on behalf of his 9-month-old son, Owen, whom he was carrying on his shoulder. ''This guy is happier without the biting cold,'' Mr. Welburn said, adding that Owen's mother, Melissa, was the same way. On the other hand, Mr. Welburn and his older son, Will, 21/2, love the snow and tobogganing. ''We play in the snow right there, on that mound in particular,'' Mr. Welburn said, motioning toward a small hill just off the West 72nd Street entrance to Central Park. ''This whole area is well populated with sleds in the winter.'' Jason Krantz, 38, another lawyer who lives on the Upper West Side, said he didn't miss the snow. His two toddlers and a nephew were busy clambering up a big boulder, yelling ''123!'' and then jumping down into Mr. Krantz's outstretched arms. ''I enjoy the snow when it's here,'' Mr. Krantz said as he watched for flying children. ''But I'm just as happy when there's no snow here as well, because you don't have to cover the kids in scarves and gloves and mittens.'' Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University, said mild temperatures were likely to persist in the New York metropolitan region for the next week or so. If there is no snow by Friday, he said, it will break a record established on Jan. 4, 1878, for the latest winter appearance of snow. Mr. Miner said it was not quite clear why snow had failed to appear. ''The northern branch of the jet stream -- the delivery system of arctic air -- has hunkered down near the Arctic Circle,'' he said. It may be because of a complex interaction between ocean temperatures and snow cover in Canada, Mr. Miner said. He cautioned that it would be easy to read too much into the lack of snow so far. The previous four winters, Mr. Miner said, each produced more than 40 inches of snow in New York City, nearly double the annual average of 22.4 inches. Still, Julianne Warren, 40, a conservation biologist visiting New York from Lexington, Va., is concerned. She said she heard a white-throated sparrow in Central Park and saw an azalea blooming. ''Things seem a little --'' she said, and then wiggled her outstretched right hand as if it were an airplane in turbulence. ''It may mean the flowers don't bloom at the right time and birds may not know to migrate at the right time.''"
"Rick Pratt used a 12-inch chain saw to give Millard Fillmore his version of the presidential treatment. Quick, precise jabs sheared chunks from a length of century-old silver maple, followed by several long strokes and another round of short slices. As the sawdust settled, the cheeks, nose and chin of America's 13th president were revealed. It would take Mr. Pratt another week of carving, sanding and staining before the 10-foot version of the mostly forgettable Fillmore joined the growing wooden pantheon of Buffalo icons, including Frederick Law Olmsted; Frank Lloyd Wright, who built a series of houses here; and, of course, a buffalo. Several dozen trunks sat near his shed in the shadow of an abandoned mill, waiting to be transformed into, among other figures, Marlin Perkins of ''Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom,'' Tim Russert of ''Meet the Press'' on NBC and Bob McAdoo, a star on the old Buffalo Braves basketball team. Making so many totems of Buffalo's beloved is a chain saw artist's dream, especially for Mr. Pratt, who grew up in western New York and spent 14 years cutting down trees for a living. But the task is tinged with sadness, since the trees are some of the nearly 4,000 of Buffalo's finest felled in last October's freakish snowstorm. By letting the dead elms, oaks and maples live on as monuments to nearby natives and significant figures like the author Joyce Carol Oates and the actor James Whitmore, Mr. Pratt and the organizers of Carvings for a Cause, who hired him, are trying in some small way to make this battered city whole again. ''With tree work, you make a big empty spot, but with carving, you're creating something,'' said Mr. Pratt, 44, who is as soft-spoken as his chain saw is noisy. ''These trees are being resurrected not just as trees. You're giving them another life.'' Therese Forton-Barnes, a Buffalo native who started Carvings for a Cause soon after the storm, is charging businesses $7,500 to display these one-ton statues in front of their offices. (She accepts requests for subject matter; a local power company, for example, is considering a Thomas Edison carving.) The money will help pay Mr. Pratt -- who charges $3,000 per statue, about 60 percent of his normal rate for carving bears, eagles and American Indians -- and buy new trees to plant throughout the city. ''I just couldn't see 200-year-old trunks going to the dump,'' Ms. Forton-Barnes said. ''These trees are like everyone's babies. They are like the roots of the families who live here.'' The to-be-carved list is a work in progress: Buffalo Bob Smith, host of ''The Howdy Doody Show,'' made it, but O. J. Simpson, the longtime Buffalo Bills running back, was skipped to avoid controversy. Some potential subjects have admittedly tenuous connections to the Queen City. William McKinley, the 25th president, is included because he was shot by an anarchist assassin while visiting the Buffalo Pan-American Exposition; Gov. DeWitt Clinton, because he was the father of the Erie Canal, which dumps out here. The monuments are just one of the ways Buffalo, known for decades as the City of Trees, is trying to salve the deep scars the storm left in the local landscape and civic psyche. City leaders have donated tens of thousands of dollars to replanting efforts, and hundreds of residents have volunteered to plant bare-root trees starting this month. As those efforts get under way, the sound of chain saws and chippers is filling the still-chilly air. Dozens of crews have fanned out across Buffalo and surrounding towns to remove trees that remain hazards to homes and utility lines. On many streets, stumps are interspersed with trees that were strong enough to withstand the blizzard that broke some of their brethren down the middle. The storm, which dropped more than 22 inches of snow in 16 hours, was particularly devastating because it hit before most trees had lost their leaves, which added significant weight. Many residents assumed that any tree that survived the winter would be spared, but as the crews have gone after trees marked for removal with orange ribbons tied around their trunks or X's spray-painted on their bark, neighbors are realizing that they will soon be without many of their leafy old friends. One recent morning, Thomas Jones emerged from his house in the University District to find a five-man team from Schneck's Tree Removal cutting down a maple across the street. The city's forest manager, Arthur V. Traver III, pulled up an aerial map of the block on his laptop and showed Mr. Jones that the tree was among six on the street to be toppled that day, explaining that even though buds were poking from its branches, the tree would ultimately wither because so much of its canopy had been lost. ''You kind of persuaded me, but I'm still going to miss it,'' Mr. Jones said. ''I was thinking that at least I still have a little shade.'' Residents citywide are getting this kind of crash course in arboriculture -- one they have not had since Dutch elm disease wiped out nearly 100,000 of Buffalo's trees in the 1960s and '70s. This time, about 4,000 trees are to be removed from the city's rights of way; thousands more are being cut down in parks, on private property and in surrounding towns. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will pay to remove many of the trees, but not their stumps, which are sometimes as expensive to grind or uproot. Several groups have sprouted to train volunteers -- one, Re-Tree WNY, plans to plant 30,000 trees over five years -- and donations have poured in from foundations, companies and citizens of all stripes. But since many trees grow only about a foot a year, those lost will take decades to really replace, adding urgency to Mr. Pratt's efforts. His trunks-to-totems project will remind Buffalo residents how large some of their lost trees were. Like the trees themselves, the chain saw sculptures are seen as a tangible link to the city's past: Among the local heroes waiting to be carved are Harold Arlen, who wrote songs like ''Stormy Weather'' and ''Over the Rainbow''; the aviation pioneer Glenn H. Curtiss; and Grover Cleveland, mayor of Buffalo, governor of New York and president of the United States. ''Energy never dies, it just transforms into a different shape,'' Mr. Pratt said. ''We hope people will slow down for a minute and look at things differently.''"
"Slider, the Cleveland Indians' furry mascot, hung ''K'' signs from Bernie Brewer's perch above the left-field bleachers and slid down his slide after a Kelly Shoppach home run. John Adams, the Indians' famed drummer for more than 30 years, pounded out his familiar cadence in the right-field bleachers. And when the ubiquitous sausages raced around Miller Park after the sixth inning Tuesday night, the man who usually portrays the Italian sausage sat in the stands in a white Cleveland Indians jersey and tattered cap. John Lowther, 24, grew up in Youngstown, Ohio. He asked for the night off so he could cheer on his favorite American League team with his girlfriend, Erika Thompson. Another worker replaced him. All this because frigid conditions and the aftermath of a snowstorm at Jacobs Field necessitated a change of venue for the Indians' three-game series with the Los Angeles Angels. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, it was Major League Baseball's first neutral-site shift due to weather since Montreal and Florida played two games at U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago on Sept. 13 and 14, 2004, because of Hurricane Ivan. Almost a foot of snow remained at Jacobs Field on Monday, when the Indians failed for the third consecutive day to play a single inning against Seattle. Friday's home opener against the Mariners had to be postponed because of snow with the game one out from becoming official. ''I've seen enough snow already for a year, maybe for a lifetime,'' said Indians reliever Roberto Hern√°ndez, the former Met. The weather here wasn't springlike either. But the closed roof kept conditions dry and playable, and the Indians won their first official game in five days, beating the Angels, 7-6. The outside temperature was 42 degrees at game time, with snow -- what else? -- in the forecast. ''It felt good to just play,'' Indians center fielder Grady Sizemore said. Some Indians fans felt playing a home game in Milwaukee was appropriate. Miller Park is adjacent to the former site of County Stadium, the Indians' ''home'' field for several scenes in the movie ''Major League.'' The Indians lost all three games they previously played at Miller Park as visitors, an interleague series last year. How well this series would draw was a point of conjecture. Brewers officials, with one day's notice, expected about 10,000 Tuesday night. The lure of something unusual, and inexpensive tickets -- all seats were $10, or $6 less than the Brewers usually charge for their best bleacher seats -- proved a far bigger attraction that anyone could have guessed. A crowd of 19,031 filled the lower two decks and spilled over into the bleachers. Lines were exceptionally long at the concessions stands. Cleveland Manager Eric Wedge called the turnout ''nothing short of outstanding.'' The crowd appeared mixed with Wisconsinites, Indians fans and the curious. Most greeted the Indians warmly when they took the field. During the game, they booed the Angels' Gary Matthews Jr., whose name has surfaced in connection with a nationwide drug distribution ring, and Shea Hillenbrand, who began a home run trot on a ball that hit the left-field wall in the fourth and only reached first base. Fans lined up at the gates more than two hours before the first pitch. Among the first was Al Fekety, a 45-year-old health care worker from Staten Island who used frequent flyer miles to make a spur-of-the-moment trip. Joe and Robert Madison, brothers who are Indians fans, drove seven hours from Cleveland. Both work for U.P.S., and Robert, 26, is recovering from a back injury. ''We just figured we'd come check it out,'' said Joe, 24. ''Long drive for a home game.'' Mark Uffner, a 48-year-old laborer from Chicago, sat on a bench outside the stadium in an Indians cap, his ticket already in his pocket. ''Fifth row behind the plate, an $85 seat for 10 bucks, and a chance to see C. C.,'' said Uffner, meaning Indians starter C. C. Sabathia. In the parking lot, Brewers fan Mike Meinzer and four friends watched the wind-whipped flames from a small charcoal grill. Meinzer, a chef at the Capital Grille in Milwaukee, was in charge of the burgers and brats. The chance to see the Angels' Vladimir Guerrero proved an irresistible attraction to these Brewers fans despite the weather. ''We're experts at coming here in the freezing cold,'' Meinzer said. ''Every opening day, it's either raining or 20 degrees.'' Then there was Lowther, a social worker who is such a diehard Indians fan he made Thompson watch ''Major League'' on their second date. ''I'm a big Brewers fan, too,'' he said. For this night, he did not have to be. BASEBALL"
"After a Major Wildfire, It Seems, Some Forests Are Better Left Alone What to do with a forest after an extensive fire? The answer has often been to harvest the dead trees (in part to try to make up for economic losses caused by the fire) and plant seedlings to re-establish the forest. But there has been a growing debate as to whether salvage logging and replanting is the best post-fire approach. A study in southwestern Oregon suggests one reason it might not be: areas that are managed in this way tend to burn more severely the next time the forest catches fire. Jonathan R. Thompson of Oregon State University and colleagues studied an area in the Siskiyou Mountains near the coast. The area burned in 1987, and parts of it were logged and replanted with conifers. In August 2002 the area burned again in a huge blaze known as the Biscuit Fire. Using satellite images and forest management data, the researchers created a model to calculate the severity of fire in randomly selected plots. Their findings are published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In general, areas that burned severely in 1987 burned severely again 15 years later. But among these, the researchers found, areas that were left unmanaged had less devastation. Salvage logging leaves behind debris like treetops and branches that are a ready source of fuel, as are young conifer plantations, with their uniform growth. In unmanaged areas, the researchers say, regrowth is more diverse, and there are likely to be gaps that reduce fire severity. Froggy Went A-Raftin' From South America, Millions of Years Ago Scientists at Penn State have penciled in the branches of the evolutionary tree of a major group of frogs, the eleutherodactylines, in the process making a surprising discovery: the species dispersed from South America to Central America and the Caribbean over water, not land. There are roughly 800 species of eleutherodactylines, small frogs that, unlike many frogs found in temperate climates, lay their eggs on land. Scientists have not known how the species got from South America to the West Indies and Latin America and Mexico, but the prevailing theory was that they traveled across an ancient land mass between North and South America. Then about 70 or 80 million years ago this land mass moved eastward, taking some frogs with it (into what is now the Caribbean) and isolating the frogs to the north. But the new research, a genetic analysis of 300 species directed by S. Blair Hedges, a Penn State professor, shows that the Caribbean frogs diverged from a common South American ancestor much later than that -- in a single event 47 million to 29 million years ago. And the eleutherodactylines in Latin America and Mexico diverged from a South American ancestor 42 million to 31 million years ago. The findings, reported in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggest that in both cases frogs from South America traveled across the water, probably hitching a ride on floating vegetation. Warming in the Arctic? Blame the Snow. The Dirty Snow, That Is. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases get most of the blame for climate change. And rightly so, as they are by far the most dominant influence globally. But don't forget dirt. Building on research from earlier in the decade, scientists at the University of California, Irvine, have calculated the warming effect of soot falling on Arctic snow. And the result may come as a surprise: in the Arctic, dirty snow may be responsible for more warming than greenhouse gases. ''It turns out that nothing is more efficient at increasing the Earth's temperature than soot in snow,'' said Charles S. Zender, a professor of Earth system science at the university. Soot, from coal burning, inefficient cookstoves and forest and agricultural fires, falls in the Arctic, darkening snow. Dark colors absorb more sunlight than lighter colors and radiate more heat in return. Previous studies had looked at this basic effect and found that it contributed to regional warming. ''But they had probably underestimated the impact,'' Dr. Zender said. The new work, published in The Journal of Geophysical Research, takes a more detailed look at the effects of soot. Among other things, Dr. Zender said, it accelerates the ''aging'' of snow, as fine crystals turn into larger grains and the snow turns darker. (City dwellers are quite familiar with this phenomenon, as a bright white blanket turns to gray within days.) With this and other effects built into their model, the researchers found that over the past 200 years, dirty snow has been responsible for 0.5 to 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming in the Arctic. Over all, the region has warmed 1.6 degrees in that time. Dr. Zender said that several steps could be taken to reduce the impact. One is a matter of timing. If farmers must burn fields, for example, it's better to do it in the late summer and fall, when the impact on the snow cover will be less. More efficient cookstoves for villagers across Asia would also help. By burning cleaner, they would produce less soot. Conversely they would produce more carbon dioxide, ''but in this case emitting CO2 is the lesser of two evils,'' Dr. Zender said. Observatory Correction: June 14, 2007, Thursday An illustration with a short article in Science Times on Tuesday about the effect that soot in snow has on warming in the Arctic incorrectly included a penguin. Penguins do not live in the Arctic; the northernmost penguins are those on the Gal√°pagos Islands, around the Equator."
"Here is a fact: Snow falls in winter. Here is another fact: Snow fell yesterday, Day 70 of this particular winter. It was expected to be a decent amount -- 6 to 10 inches, the weather people said -- more than a dusting, but less than the Apocalypse. Streets were salted, snowplows mobilized and schoolchildren sent home early. At the end of the day, however, it was not the end of time. Mostly, it was a pain. As Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg put it, ''When you have snow, it is annoying.'' As of 10:40 p.m., 3.7 inches of snow had landed in Central Park and 4 inches at La Guardia Airport, said Bill Goodman, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Brookhaven, on Long Island. Danbury, Conn., reported 3.8 inches at 10 p.m., and Nutley, N.J., reported 4.5 inches at 9:30 p.m. At a news conference yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg did mention that New York had gotten 32 inches of snow so far this winter, not including last night's storm. Seeing as the Department of Sanitation had budgeted $26 million to remove it -- at roughly $1 million an inch -- the snow removal fund, he said, is in the red. ''We have used up the city's budget,'' Mr. Bloomberg confessed. (Later, however, city officials said the budget shortfall would be made up easily out of the city's general fund.) Snow is not sulfuric acid. Or toxic waste. Or anthrax. It isn't even ugly until the poodles come around. Nonetheless, the snow made people work for their paychecks yesterday, including John J. Doherty, the city's sanitation commissioner. ''We're getting a little tired of it,'' Mr. Doherty said, which only made sense. Every time it snows, Mr. Doherty has to make sure his entire fleet of garbage trucks has plows. The storm moved into the New York region about 11 a.m., said Jeff Warner, a meteorologist from Pennsylvania State University. Lest anyone think that snow is odd in March, Mr. Warner said two major blizzards have arrived in the third month of the year. There was the ''superstorm'' of 1993, he said, which dropped a foot of snow on New York from March 12 to March 14. Then there was the Blizzard of 1888, which set the record for snowfall on a single day, March 12, at 16.5 inches. According to Steve Fybish, an amateur weather historian with a habit of calling reporters on deadline with interesting weather facts, this winter is the first since the late 19th century that has produced three snowstorms of five inches or more within a nine-day period. From Feb. 20 to 21, he said, five inches of snow fell; from Feb. 24 to 25, six inches fell. Mr. Fybish said he was hoping that at least five inches would fall this time. ''To get three in this period is, I think, unprecedented,'' he said. ''That's kind of fun.'' New Jersey was the first to be hit by the storm. The speed limit on some parts of the New Jersey Turnpike was reduced and there were flight delays of as long as three hours at Newark Liberty International Airport. In Cherry Hill and other places in South Jersey, school officials sent their students home early. ''The road conditions aren't that bad right now,'' Susan Bastnagel, a spokeswoman for the Cherry Hill public schools, said in the late afternoon. But heavy snowfall was expected just when the elementary schools would be dismissing their students. ''We typically don't dismiss students early,'' Ms. Bastnagel admitted. ''We've had a lot of calls from parents complaining.'' Even Jack Lettiere, the New Jersey transportation commissioner, did not sound overly concerned. ''A storm like this, of 6 to 10 inches,'' he said, ''we can handle quite well.'' At a real estate office in Park Slope, Brooklyn, Steven Rutter, 46, was asked about the storm. ''What storm?'' he said. ''We've had much worse winters. All we've had are these three- or four-inch snows that melt in a day.'' Down the block at a D'Agostino grocery store, a manager said he had not seen the kind of spurt in business that comes when customers lay in supplies. Meanwhile, Wesley Weissberg, 40, stood at the register with 18 bags of food. Supplies for the snow? Sort of. ''I was on vacation,'' Ms. Weissberg said. ''There's no food in the house and there's a storm coming.'' The storm hit much of the East Coast. More than half the schools in Virginia were closed, for example, as the storm sliced through the state. The mountainous areas of North Carolina had as much as nine inches of soft, white, crystalline flakes by early evening. Back in Brooklyn, there were bags of rock salt and bags of topsoil outside Tarzian True Value Hardware on Seventh Avenue. ''The season is almost done for the winter, so we're preparing for spring,'' said James Cofield, the assistant manager. One of the store's customers, Ohad Talmore, 34, was sizing up a shovel. Perhaps he was concerned about the storm? ''I'm originally from Switzerland,'' Mr. Talmore said. ''It's not a big deal.''"
"One temptation yesterday, when hands without gloves were in danger of becoming as scaly as a reptile's, was to say that April is only hours away. April is only hours away -- 504 hours, give or take a few. Another temptation, once April had found its way into the conversation, was to bend T.S. Eliot's line about the cruelest month to fit the wackiness of mid-March. What could be more cruel than a 63-degree day on Monday, a 1 1/2-inches-of-snow day on Tuesday and a 30-degree day yesterday? But why twist Eliot? It would be simpler to be straightforward: March just cannot make up its mind. Warm? Cold? Snow? Rain? March is trying everything, and the consensus yesterday was that it should have stuck with Monday. ''Monday, everybody was happy, in a better mood, like spring came and everybody said, 'I'm sick and tired of that difficult winter,''' said Ares Mavropoulos, a taxi driver who was threading his way up Eighth Avenue yesterday. ''Now everybody's miserable.'' And Tuesday? He said the best evidence of how disconcerting the snow and wind were was the behavior of his fellow taxi drivers. ''Nobody was blowing their horns,'' he said. ''It was so unrealistic, they couldn't believe it.'' The meteorologists said it was not so unrealistic, though. New Yorkers peeled off their coats on Monday because the jet stream had retreated to Canada, clearing the way for warm air to cruise in. Jeff Warner, a forecaster with Pennsylvania State University, said that was not unusual for March. Nor is it unusual for cold air to return as unexpectedly as it left. ''It's a not-so-subtle reminder that winter is still here,'' Mr. Warner said. Stephen Fybish, who tracks weather statistics from his apartment on the Upper West Side, said the change between Monday's warmth and Tuesday's snow was not even close to the steepest one-day drop in temperature on record. That happened on March 28, 1921, with a high of 82. The temperature fell to 34 by midnight, he said, and by the next morning the reading in Central Park was 26. But the combination of falling temperatures and, well, snow appeared to be the most drastic in almost five years, Mr. Fybish said. On April 8, 2000, he said, the temperature leveled off at 71 degrees about 2 p.m. By midnight, it had fallen to 51. The snow started around daybreak, he said, and by 10 a.m., the temperature was down to 30. The snowfall measured 1.2 inches, he said. But back to yesterday, when New York slipped and slid and shivered. Taciturn fishermen in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, said it was too cold to go out -- the fish were still hibernating, one asserted from the warmth of the Stella Maris bait-and-tackle store on Emmons Avenue. Dog walkers in Manhattan were out, though -- and their dogs wore protective booties. ''It's not supposed to be like this,'' said Attah Frimpong, a dog walker in Riverside Park. ''It's almost the middle of March.'' Yes, and it was, once again, bundle-up weather. Mr. Frimpong said he had three or four shirts on under his puffy jacket. A few blocks away, on the Broadway median at 87th Street, Patrick Tavernia, a retired stage director at the Metropolitan Opera, was undaunted. His jacket was open. ''I like the sunshine,'' Mr. Tavernia said, adding that he would not mind a suntan. ''Man, I'm tired of this weather,'' he said, his mind skipping past spring as it fast-forwarded to summer. He paused, then added: ''I love New York in the summer. But I'm hardly ever here. I spend my summers in Italy.''"
"A day after spring seemed to burst out of hiding, winter came charging back to the New York region yesterday with a storm that brought plunging temperatures and wind-whipped snow that appeared strangely immune to gravity -- blowing up and sideways as well as down. From street corners, office windows and front porches, many watched in dismay as the blizzard-like storm raged with intensity. Some said it seemed like a cruel joke on those who only hours earlier had doffed jackets and looked eagerly for crocus shoots. ''It's completely unacceptable,'' said Louisa DeRose, a 24-year-old student at New York Law School, as she sipped coffee during a break outside on Worth Street. ''I would rather that yesterday didn't happen. It was like a false ray of hope.'' The storm created hazardous conditions and resulted in major delays and frustration for thousands of drivers leaving work yesterday afternoon, just as standing water and slush on streets and highways was turning to ice. Last night, strong winds battered the region, pushing pedestrians off sidewalks in Midtown and toppling trees. There were delays and cancellations at all three New York area airports, with wind gusts posing more of a problem than snow on the runways. Several planes were diverted to Baltimore and Washington, but the decisions were made by pilots, not air traffic controllers, said James Peters, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. A Hawker aircraft that was landing at Teterboro Airport skidded 200 to 300 feet off a runway around 10:15 p.m., Tony Ciavolella, a spokesman for the airport, said. None of the two passengers and two crew members were injured, he said. It was not clear if weather was a factor, he said, but the airport was closed overnight. The state and local police reported numerous accidents and traffic tie-ups on icy roadways. On Route 3 in Clifton, N.J., traffic was backed up for several miles in both directions because of spinouts and fender-benders, as well as a jackknifed tractor-trailer. All eastbound lanes of the Long Island Expressway were shut down at Exit 49 just before 6 p.m. because of another jackknifed trailer. In Westchester County, 72 disabled vehicles and 19 accidents had been reported as of 6:30 p.m. ''People are traveling in packs, and if one person panics and applies the brakes, you'll have several cars running into each other,'' said Lt. Michael J. Palumbo of the Westchester County police. Traffic on some avenues in Manhattan was nearly halted by 5 p.m. At Amsterdam Avenue and 122nd Street, where drivers must negotiate a hill, cars were spinning their wheels. Not far away, at Broadway and 110th Street, a pedestrian trying to cross the street was seen making a near perfect belly flop on the pavement. In Farmingdale, on Long Island, there was a three-hour backlog of calls to the state police for accidents and stranded vehicles. The storm started out as rain but turned to snow throughout much of the region as temperatures fell. Between 7 a.m. and 3 p.m. in Central Park, the thermometer dropped to 24 degrees from 51 degrees. There were sustained winds of 15 to 25 miles per hour, and gusts of up to 48 miles per hour in White Plains and at Kennedy International Airport. Over all, the snowfall was relatively modest, with most places getting a few inches. By late afternoon, as the storm was winding down, 4 inches were recorded in Islip on Long Island; 4 inches in New Fairfield, Conn.; 2 inches in Bergenfield, N.J.; and 1.5 inches in Central Park. But a huge amount of snow fell in other areas, and the storm lingered longer over Long Island and eastern Connecticut. Averill Park, near Albany, received 18 inches, 5 of them in a single hour. ''When it did come down, it came down pretty heavy and quick, and sometimes that can be just as disruptive as a storm that produces more snow but over a longer duration,'' said Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. Many schools and organizations canceled afternoon and evening activates, while even some major retailers closed early. Power companies said they experienced scattered but mostly minor failures caused by high winds, as well as by cars that had crashed into utility poles. One exception was on Long Island, where 6,800 customers lost power, primarily in Manhasset, Merrick and East Meadow, the Long Island Power Authority reported. The snow arrived like a final dollop on top of an especially snowy winter, with 37 inches recorded in Central Park before yesterday's storm, according to Jeff Warner, a Penn State meteorologist. Normal snowfall through March 7 in the park is 19 inches, he said. Some parents and children seemed frustrated that the snow meant extra chores but little winter romping, what with the high winds and mainly skimpy accumulation. Walking in Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn, Xavier Marechaux, a teacher, took off his fedora and plopped it on the head of his 6-year-old son, David. ''I'm starting to get a little fed up,'' Mr. Marechaux said. ''It was nice at the beginning, but I have to clean my sidewalk and my car, and it's still not enough for a really good snow day.'' But others seemed almost pleased to have been caught off guard. ''I think it's a good thing,'' said Richard Diener, a retired social studies teacher who was in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn. ''Life still has to have mystery and surprise.'' And perhaps no one was as wistful as Andrew Walter, for whom it was moving day. Mr. Walter, a 35-year-old advertising executive bound for San Francisco, was clearing his sidewalk in Carroll Gardens, so the movers would not slip. ''Today is the last time I'll see snow for a long time,'' he said, ''so I'm happy about it.''"
"The low yesterday morning was 5 degrees in Central Park, a single degree for every mitten-covered digit on one hand. The January nadir came at the end of a workweek of jumping across slush, slipping on ice and enduring transit distress. The week began with a fire that hobbled one New York subway line and closed another. It ended with downed power lines that slowed New Jersey commuter trains. Forecasters say today begins a week of thawing temperatures with a chance of reaching 40 degrees. In February. For New Jersey Transit passengers yesterday, the morning began with a break in the wires that run above the rails east of Secaucus, shutting down one of the two tracks into Manhattan. Twenty-three trains were rerouted to Hoboken and five others were canceled. Nineteen other trains that reached Pennsylvania Station ran up to 35 minutes late. Peter Dancy, a banker who lives in Glen Ridge, N.J., said that on Monday, rerouted trains caused his usual 65-minute commute, including the train ride to Penn Station and a subway ride to Lexington Avenue and 53rd Street, to stretch to two hours. Yesterday, the rerouted trains slowed his commute again. And it was cold. How cold was it? Actually, not as cold as many thought -- relatively speaking. As of yesterday, this January, as measured by temperatures in Central Park, has so far ranked as only the 66th coldest on record, according to Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. At an average of 31.6 degrees, this January doesn't even begin to approach the record of 21.7 degrees, set in 1918. The lowest temperature that January, when Woodrow Wilson delivered his Fourteen Points speech, was minus 4 degrees. This month tied as the 16th snowiest so far, at 15.1 inches. But the lowest temperature recorded this January, 5 degrees yesterday, was far from the lowest temperature of minus 2 degrees recorded in the last 30 years (set in the Januarys of 1977, 1985 and 1994). The lowest temperature ever in Central Park was minus 15 degrees, on Feb. 9, 1934. So were any records set? Yes, and it is one explanation for why there has been so much kvetching about the weather recently. The first half of the month was unusually warm (11 degrees above normal) and the second half unusually cold (12 degrees below normal). Stephen Fybish, 68, an amateur weather enthusiast in Manhattan, said that if New Yorkers felt whipsawed, it was because the temperature swung a dizzying 61 degrees, the third biggest difference from the highest to lowest temperatures recorded in a month since 1869. Stanley Gedzelman, executive editor of Weatherwise, a magazine for weather enthusiasts, cited other reasons New Yorkers complain about the weather: short memories and television weathermen. ''Isn't it stormier now with global warming than ever before, I'm always asked,'' said Mr. Gedzelman, 60, an earth and atmospheric sciences professor at City College of New York. ''And the answer is pretty much, no. When you listen to TV forecasts, it's not cold enough so they have to throw in the wind-chill factor. It adds drama.'' Also, transit and other problems tend to multiply in the cold, he said. ''Winter shuts the system down,'' Mr. Gedzelman said. ''If you're entranced at all by power, which the whole human race is entranced by, then you get swept away by the weather. Snowstorms shut down the rat race in New York City.'' And for sheer dilapidated absurdity, today's winters don't rank with the fierce winters of the 1960's, Mr. Gedzelman said. One frigid night as an undergraduate at City College, the professor recalled, the doors to his subway car failed to close. ''And there they were,'' he said. ''Snowdrifts in the A train.''"
"A month across the abyss of winter, the season's first major storm buried New York and much of the Northeast yesterday, stifling travel, slowing the pace of life for millions and recasting the landscapes of 12 states. The storm, touted as a probable blizzard, roared in from the Midwest and turned into a classic northeaster, with 30-to-50-mile-an-hour winds and nebular arms revolving counterclockwise. It moved up the East Coast, gathering ocean moisture and hurling it back at the land as snow that blanketed cities and towns, closed airports, canceled hundreds of flights, choked railways and highways and filled the air with crystalline impressions. It began quietly in the New York metropolitan area before noon, a gentle whispering fall in the pale January light. But by evening, it had become a driving force of windblown snow, with gusts that hissed against the windows and mounting accumulations that, meteorologists said, only hinted at the depths to come. By late this morning, those accumulations were expected to top out at 12 to 18 inches in Central Park and 18 to 24 inches in parts of Northern New Jersey, Eastern Long Island, Southern Connecticut and shore areas of Rhode Island. Cape Cod and Southeastern Massachusetts were expected to be hit hardest, with more than two feet of snow blown by winds that gusted up to 60 miles an hour. Lesser totals were expected in the Washington area and in Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania and southern sections of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. The Northeast was hardly alone in wintry misery. Heavy snows pounded parts of the Midwest, with the Chicago area getting its biggest snowfall of the season: more than 8 inches by yesterday afternoon with more to come. At O'Hare International Airport, flight delays averaged seven and a half hours and hundreds of stranded passengers slept on cots near baggage claim areas. In Connecticut, Gov. M. Jodi Rell ordered a state emergency operations center to open yesterday as forecasters predicted coastal flooding in parts of New London and Middlesex Counties. Blizzard warnings were posted for most of New York State. The mid-Hudson Valley was expected to get 20 inches of snow, and up to a foot was forecast for Albany, the Mohawk Valley and parts of western New York. Three weather-related deaths were reported in Ohio, where a man fell through ice on a pond and two people suffered heart attacks shoveling snow. In Wisconsin, the Milwaukee suburb of West Allis had 12 inches of snow and up to 5 inches more was expected overnight. Southern Michigan had 6 to 14 inches of snow yesterday, and three-foot drifts were common. In the pantheon of winter storms in New York, it did not compare with the all-time record blizzard of Dec. 26-27, 1947, which interred the city in 26.4 inches of snow, and was also expected to fall short of the blizzard of Jan. 7-8, 1996, which left 20.2 inches in Central Park. But Todd J. Miner, a meteorologist with Pennsylvania State University, said it could rival the President's Day storm last year, which left 19.8 inches. ''This is a big, nasty snowstorm,'' Mr. Miner said early yesterday afternoon. ''It's possible we will be heading toward well over a foot of snow in Central Park. We're not going to get two feet, but heading toward 18 inches is not a bad signpost, bringing this into the upper echelons of storms. Of the top 12 city snowstorms on record -- 16 inches or higher -- we've probably got a good shot at that.'' Mr. Miner said that in the overnight hours, the storm would almost certainly meet the National Weather Service's criteria for a blizzard -- winds of at least 35 m.p.h., falling or blowing snow and visibility of less than a quarter-mile for three consecutive hours. But whatever the technicalities, you could hardly tell neighbors shoveling huge drifts from their driveway that it was not a blizzard. And it was cold, bitter cold. It was 29 below zero in Massena, N.Y., 28 below at Saranac Lake, N.Y., 14 below in Syracuse and 10 below in Albany. In New York City it was a relatively balmy; 10 above early yesterday morning and over 20 early last night. That was frigid enough to keep the customary tourist hordes away from Times Square, which looked more like a ghost town in the swirling snow, and it was obvious that restaurants, theaters and other attractions had a terrible day. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the three major metropolitan airports -- Kennedy International, La Guardia and Newark Liberty International -- as well as bridges, tunnels and the Port Authority Trans Hudson (PATH) rail system, went into a full mobilization of personnel and equipment, bracing for a rough weekend. All three airports remained open, but 175 flights were canceled at Kennedy, 120 more were canceled at Newark, and 200 were canceled at La Guardia, where delays ran up to two hours. A cargo plane overshot a runway at Kennedy at about 3:30 p.m. in an accident that appeared weather-related, but the Port Authority said it remained under investigation last night. Only a three-person crew was on board, and there were no injuries. Traffic was moving on the George Washington Bridge and the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, but there were 35 mile-an-hour speed limits on Staten Island bridges. With whiteout conditions on runways, the intensifying storm closed the Philadelphia airport at 3:30 p.m. and Bradley International Airport near Hartford at 6:30 p.m. and would possibly shut down those in Boston, Albany and other cities, stranding thousands of passengers. Acting Gov. Richard Codey of New Jersey announced that a state of emergency would be in effect from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. today, allowing the police to close roads, if necessary, to ensure public safety. On Long Island, Suffolk County declared a state of emergency as well. Up and down the Northeast Corridor, driving was treacherous on icy, snow-blown highways, roads and neighborhood streets. There were countless minor accidents, though no deaths or serious injuries were reported, and motorists were advised to stay home or use public transportation. But trains and buses were also delayed by the storm, and getting around, for those who had to, was an ordeal. Many residents heeded the warnings to stay home and many businesses closed for the weekend. The Long Island Rail Road, which operates 450 trains on 11 branches on a typical weekend, reported only two train cancellations, both on the Greenport line, and only minor delays on the rest of the system. ''But that could change as the storm worsens and the wind increases,'' said Brian P. Dolan, a spokesman. ''They're predicting drifts of snow. If we get 2 to 3 inches an hour, that challenges us to keep pace with the storm.'' In the meantime, he said special trains were spraying antifreeze on power rails and activating electric and gas-powered heaters to keep switches moving. Even before the snow began falling, the Metro-North Railroad had a signal problem on its upper Hudson line between Croton and Poughkeepsie that delayed about 8 trains for up to 30 minutes. Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman, said that railroad officials were meeting in the afternoon to decide whether to cut back service because it appeared that many passengers were staying home. But Dan Brucker, another spokesman, said late in the afternoon that service remained on or close to schedule on all its lines, although there were plans to sharply cut service today. New Jersey Transit, which operates 11 rail lines, 3 light rail systems and 240 bus routes around the state and into Manhattan, reduced its service schedule yesterday afternoon until midnight tonight. Later in the day, New Jersey Transit suspended its South Jersey bus service as of 5 p.m., and its North Jersey buses as of 7:30 p.m. It also reported delays of 15 to 20 minutes on its Northeast Corridor line. Dan Stessel, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit, said that express trains on the Northeast Corridor line had been canceled, although local trains continued to run. The Midtown Direct line between Penn Station and Dover, N.J., in Morris County was rerouted to Hoboken, where passengers could switch to PATH trains running to 33rd Street in Manhattan. Forewarned, cities and counties across the region had readied armies of equipment and sent out fleets of salt spreaders and snowplows to counterattack as the snow began falling. In New Jersey, state transportation officials and the New Jersey Turnpike Authority had more than 2,000 trucks on the roads to plow and spread salt. The Port Authority also had hundreds of pieces of equipment out, and more than 200,000 gallons of liquid de-icing chemicals for use on wings and other surfaces. In New York, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg went to the department's Queens repair shop and said 2,500 sanitation workers -- using 1,450 garbage trucks with plows, 82 dump trucks with plows and 350 salt spreaders -- would work around the clock in two shifts to keep major arteries and streets open. He said he expected that all of the city's 6,300 miles of streets would be plowed at least once by the start of the workweek tomorrow morning. Mr. Bloomberg also issued a few words of caution. ''The streets even after they are plowed will be slippery, so you should take caution,'' he said. ''The streets will be narrower, the snow has to go some place.'' He also urged residents to dress warmly, check on neighbors, take mass transit to work and keep cars off the streets so the plows can get through. Many schools with Saturday classes closed. Aqueduct and the Meadowlands Racetrack canceled their Saturday racing programs, and many college basketball games were postponed. National Football League conference championship games in Philadelphia (Eagles-Atlanta Falcons) and Pittsburgh (Steelers-New England Patriots) were still on track for today and, with the snow over by game times, only bitter cold and high winds were expected to be factors. The storm's timing significantly diminished its impact. For millions of suburban commuters and students home for the weekend, the snow was not a great hardship, except for the ordeal of shoveling a driveway or sidewalk, which leads every winter to many heart attacks. But for many residents of the metropolitan area, the storm provided an opportunity -- one of the few in a relatively mild winter that has recorded a total of only 4.3 inches of snow since autumn -- to get out with sleds, skis or snowshoes and to frolic in the drifts. And for those so inclined, it was a chance to relax indoors, snowed in with Bach, Brubeck or a good book, cozy behind panes embroidered with frost. For those who ventured out to play -- hooded, booted, muffled to the eyes -- the storm offered glimpses of nature's beauty: empty streets turned into white meadows, black-and-white woodlands painted in moonlight, snowflakes glittering like confections in a bakery -- frosted, glazed, powdered, sugary -- and in the parks children, romping, padded like armadillos. There were many last-minute shoppers yesterday, even as the snow began falling. Doreen and Neal Erps, of North Brunswick, N.J., wheeled a cart out of a Home Depot on Route 1 in Edison with cabinet shelves. ''I figure we'll be in the house all weekend long,'' said Mr. Erps. ''We might as well do something productive, and remodeling the bathroom beats shoveling snow.'' Nearby, Howard Myers, of New Brunswick, N.J., was loading up his S.U.V. with groceries and firewood. ''My next stop is the liquor store,'' he said. ''I'm going to get a nice bottle of Scotch, put the logs on the fire and let the storm rage outside while I read my book.'' At a Home Depot on 23rd Street in Manhattan, shovels, salt buckets, windshield scrapers and other storm equipment flew off the shelves. By 12:30 p.m., only four of the 40 snowblowers delivered on Friday -- some fetching $729 -- were left, and the shovels were gone. ''Where are the shovels?'' asked an anxious customer, one of a cluster. ''They are unloading them right now,'' an employee said. ''C'mon, let's go,'' another patron said as the group hurried downstairs to meet the delivery truck."
"RECENTLY, after a long, midstorm ski session at Mammoth Mountain, Calif., Dan Molnar glided home along a steep route that locals call the Condo Chute. From there, it's usually a short walk back to his two-story house. But there was so much snow, he said, that he was able to walk from the hill right onto the top of his roof -- ''and then skied off it,'' he said, ''right to the back of my house.'' For Mr. Molnar, a 36-year-old lifelong skier, having that much snow was a new, enjoyable experience. But can there be too much of a good thing? That's what some ski resorts out West are wondering after near-record snowfall totals these past few weeks -- including more than 16 feet of snow since Dec. 26 -- have created ideal skiing conditions on many slopes, but have made roads impassable and paralyzed transportation systems. Indeed, during the height of the California storms' fury, Interstate 80 and Highway 50, the main routes into Lake Tahoe, and Highway 395 into Mammoth Mountain, were closed for several hours, and nearly 200 people were stranded in their cars in deep snow in the San Bernardino Mountains above Los Angeles. On Jan. 6, in Mammoth Lakes, a couple died in a snow-buried car. In an avalanche near the Canyons in Utah on Jan. 14, at least one skier was killed, buried under four feet of snow, and at least two others were feared dead as rescuers continued to search on Monday. The massive avalanche occurred in an area that was popular with extreme skiers and snowboarders, but was designated off-limits because of the danger of avalanches. In mid-January, snow cleanup crews from Colorado to California were still uncovering buried cars and having trouble finding space to dump tons of freshly plowed snow. Brian O'Hara, a forecaster at the National Weather Service office in Reno, said that while the snowfall totals for these storms were impressive, they didn't set records for a single storm. But Mr. Molnar said that these storms outdumped even the deepest snows of California's '97-98 El Ni√±o winter, when his dog could sit on the snow and chew on a branch in his yard that is 12 feet off the ground. Now, he said, that branch is buried. ''Even the locals who pride themselves on being kind of glib and nonchalant are saying that it's been a long time since they've seen this much snow,'' he said. Indeed, as in Lake Tahoe to the north, Park City, Utah, and Crested Butte, Colo., to the east, a drive through parts of Mammoth is akin to a trip through the snow-buried shrubbery maze in the movie ''The Shining.'' Along Main Street, 20-foot-high walls of plowed snow completely obscure local businesses and hotels, while on the residential back streets, cars, and even the first stories of homes, have vanished. ''You can't see the signs, you can't see the streets,'' said Carlos Maldonado, a former Mammoth resident who was up from Del Mar in San Diego County. ''I've never seen it so deep.'' On Jan. 12, the last of 15 feet of new snow since late December had finally come to rest on Mammoth's slopes. Under a windless, cobalt-blue sky, powder hounds were feasting on the newly opened runs and dropping off cornices into waist-deep powder. Through the woods below chairlifts, cheers rose regularly as snowboarders and skiers laid fresh tracks among the fat pinyon pines. Michael Byers, a resident of Laguna Beach, Calif., had recently returned to California after graduating from the French Culinary Institute in Manhattan. ''I've skied Aspen and Vail,'' he said, ''but this is the haute cuisine of snow skiing. The amount of snow here -- it's just shocking.'' Officially, Mammoth Mountain had received 331 inches (more than 27 feet) of snow since the ski season had opened in early October. This is an early season record for a resort that averages 400 inches in an entire season. During the peak of the powerful storms that blasted California like a fire hose, a weather station at Mammoth Crest reported a wind gust of 180 miles per hour, and whiteout conditions at times closed down most of the lifts. ''What we typically get,'' said Dana Vander Houwen, a resort spokeswoman, ''is big dumps that last three to four days and then sunshine. This was 16 days of just constant every day snowing and blowing. There was great skiing to be had, but it wasn't the sunny skies we were used to. People were kind of waiting for it to be over. Now we have this great snowpack -- a 13- to 15-foot base. I would expect that we'll be open until June, if not longer.'' Elsewhere in the West, many ski areas -- particularly those at more central and southern latitudes -- are reporting banner seasons as well. At the Arizona Snowbowl 14 miles northwest of Flagstaff, Dave Smith, a spokesman, said that the storms of late December and early January ''hammered'' the area. The upside is that the area has already seen 240 inches of snow, just 20 inches shy of its annual average, and its 32 trails are all open. ''When we opened on Nov. 26,'' said Mr. Smith, ''we were actually ranked eighth in the world for base depth. That's here in good old dry, desert Arizona. We had 42 inches in October, 55 in November, 44 in December, and we've already had 99 inches in January.'' On Jan. 4, the Pacific system that slammed California, pushed hard into the Flagstaff area, creating blizzard conditions, leading local officials to declare a state of emergency, and forcing the Snowbowl to close for a day. Since that time though, the roads have been plowed, and the weather has settled. ''Today's absolutely beautiful,'' said Mr. Smith. ''It's just incredible -- and our snowiest months are yet to come.'' Farther east in the south-central Colorado resort of Crested Butte, the resort spokeswoman, April Prout, reported 90 inches of new snow from the most recent storm and all of its 1,073 skiable acres open. ''We haven't seen this much snow in decades,'' she said. ''You look down Elk Avenue and there are just piles of snow all the way down the street.'' She added that ecstatic residents were even taking buried cars in stride. ''They're actually having trouble moving snow and finding places to put it,'' she said. But with the storm track easing up, she said visitors should have little problem getting to the town. While Canada's megaresort Whistler Blackcomb usually sits directly in the winter jet stream's storm track, this winter's more southerly blasts have left the Great White North slightly less blanketed. As of Jan. 17, the resort, which usually has base snow depths of more than 78 inches in January, was reporting unusually cold weather, lots of snowmaking, 155 of its 200 trails open and a 51-inch base, but a series of storms were expected to slam British Columbia later in the week. ''Historically at Christmas we get dumped on,'' said Sarah Aldrich, a spokeswoman, ''and we did this year, but we just haven't had as much snow since. But the groomers are awesome and the coverage is excellent.'' In some of the back bowl areas at Squaw Valley, near Lake Tahoe, snow depths are up to 30 feet. According to the resort marketing director, Eric Brandt, the mountainwide average snowpack was around 16 feet, and all of the resort's 4,000 acres were open for skiing. ''For about 15 days,'' he said of the recent storms, ''it snowed every day and averaged about a foot a day.'' While there were closures on I-80 during the storms, Mr. Brandt said that getting around town was not a big problem. ''The bottom line,'' he said, ''is that we're used to living with this sort of storm situation.'' Today, all the main streets in and around Lake Tahoe are cleared, and the weather has warmed dramatically. Since so much snow fell in the parking lot at Squaw Valley, Mr. Brandt said that the resort had created a 40-foot-tall Ayres Rock of snow in an unused corner of the resort, where workers had been piling the powder 24 hours a day. In the Wasatch Range, Park City, Utah, is flirting with record snow depth totals and is 100 percent open. ''The day after Christmas, up to this past week, it snowed two weeks without stopping,'' said the Park City spokeswoman Krista Rowles Parry. ''We've had 138 inches in that time.'' While main thoroughfares are now clear, she said, Park City has resorted to hauling away its snow and paying a company to melt it. ''Snowbanks are 20 to 25 feet high around town,'' she added. ''It's crazy, because it's like driving around in snow tunnels.'' Also unusual, she said, was that because of the southerly flow from the most recent storms, the base snow depths in Park City and at the nearby Canyons ski areas rivaled those of the legendarily inundated ski areas of Alta and Snowbird on Little Cottonwood Canyon. And, oddly, there is currently little or no snow on the ground in nearby Salt Lake City. ''People get shocked,'' said Ms. Parry, ''because they're driving up from Salt Lake, and suddenly they cross Parleys Summit and it's a winter wonderland.''"
"The travelers who went to La Guardia Airport yesterday afternoon could see the storm, but thought they could beat it. Their goal was to get out of New York City before the snow got really bad, even if it meant boarding flights that were scheduled to go to places that were not their final destinations. As the ''canceled'' notices flashed red on computer monitors at Delta Airlines and white at monitors at Northwest, there were still small teasing windows of escape. One flight to Minneapolis. One flight to Savannah, Ga. One to Atlanta. One to Columbus, Ohio. Richard Wilke, a 42-year-old consultant with Lippincott Mercer, was originally scheduled to fly to Seoul, South Korea, from Kennedy International Airport today. But with an eye on the approaching storm, he tried to fly from La Guardia to Atlanta yesterday and then on to Seoul. His Atlanta flight, scheduled to leave at 2 p.m., made it all the way to the runway. ''We thought we were going to be the last one out,'' he said. ''It was not to be.'' The flight was eventually canceled. Erum Siddiqi, 24, of Elmont, N.Y., had been scheduled to fly to Orlando, Fla., today but she rescheduled for a flight yesterday in an effort to beat the storm. That flight was canceled after she arrived at the airport and had passed through security. She then tried to get on a flight to Savannah, only to be told it was completely booked by people who had had the same idea. Matt and Jaime Borgman were trying to return home to Springfield, Mo. yesterday. Their 11:30 a.m. flight to Kansas City, Mo., on Midwest Airlines was canceled, even though there was not a snowflake in sight yet. So they went to the Delta counter in an attempt to get on a flight to Atlanta. There was room on a 3 p.m. flight, but then that, too, was canceled. ''We didn't make it,'' said Mrs. Borgman, a doctor, who said she had to be at work by 6 a.m. tomorrow. Still, to an undiscerning eye, the airport looked very much like it was operating. Planes pulled up to gates. Passengers got off with suitcases and duffel bags in tow. They retrieved their luggage at the baggage claim and lined up for taxis. But they were not coming off arriving flights; they were getting off departing flights that had made it to the runway only to be called back. Meredith Gowad Le Doff, 42, who was trying to get to Jackson, Miss., for her 79-year-old mother's wedding, was also on a flight that was canceled after it was on the runway. Mrs. Le Doff, a lawyer who works in Paris, tried to make the best of the situation. ''I'll keep myself distracted by working,'' she said. ''Maybe I'll find some billable hours.''"
"They entered the cavernous Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary Roman Catholic Church in Red Hook, Brooklyn, quietly, and never took off their coats. Indeed, a sense of frozen shock seemed to pervade yesterday's funeral Mass for Markita Jimenez Weaver, 10, who was dragged to her death from a snowbank last Sunday, apparently by a city plow. ''This terrible tragedy, this accident, this loss -- it's not what God wanted,'' said Auxiliary Bishop Rene A. Valero of Brooklyn. ''It's what happened.'' The girl's mother, Maria Jimenez, sat in one of the front pews, flanked by her son, Jesse, and Markita's father, Ronald Weaver. Markita's two younger sisters, Ronasia, 6, and Rakeema, 9, looked on nearby, while her older sister, Fuquanna Weaver, 17, fled in tears to the back before the Mass ended. The police have yet to explain what occurred at Wolcott and Richards Streets in Red Hook, where Markita was playing in the snow before the accident. Officer Chris Filippazzo, a police spokesman, said only that the investigation was continuing. Kathy Dawkins, a spokeswoman for the Department of Sanitation, said yesterday that the police interviewed several of the agency's snowplow drivers last week. She declined to say whether the department or the police have identified the driver. Mable McConey, who lives a few floors below the Weaver family in the Red Hook Houses on Richards Street, said that the driver responsible for Markita's death should come forward. ''If somebody got his license plate number, if they got something on tape -- I'm sure he knew afterwards,'' she said. Beth Schlossman, the Weaver family's lawyer, said yesterday said that Markita's parents would file a lawsuit against the city if the police determined that the driver worked for the Sanitation Department. She said that Rakeema witnessed the accident and is still struggling with its aftermath. Their mother, Ms. Schlossman added, can barely speak. ''This is very hard for her,'' she said. ''There is nothing that can bring her daughter back.''"
"BEFORE Allen Fossbender, the superintendent of schools for Easton and Redding, went to bed Tuesday night, he set his alarm for 4 a.m. Weather forecasters had been predicting it would start snowing Wednesday morning, and while children around the state were asleep, probably dreaming of a snow day, it was up to Mr. Fossbender and superintendents like him to get up early to gather data to make that decision. It is a process that is a bit scientific, involves guesswork, teamwork and is far from perfect, which is why some districts, even those close to each other, can reach different decisions. Greenwich, for example, called a two-hour delay on Wednesday, while its nearby neighbor, Darien, closed schools entirely. ''Sometimes you win and sometimes you don't, but I make the call in the best interest of the students,'' said David Snead, superintendent of Waterbury's schools, who will sometimes go out at 2 a.m. to drive the city's hills, figuring that if his sedan can't maneuver them, neither can anyone else's. His schools were closed both Monday and Wednesday. These decisions have to be made quickly, before the machinery of the school day starts, before teachers begin heading to work and the school buses head out. For many superintendents, the deadline is about 5 a.m., giving them little time to decide. On these mornings, they are very busy. The first thing Mr. Fossbender does is call the schools' director of finance and operations, Keith McLiverty, and wake him up. The two confer, and Mr. McLiverty places two calls, one to the Redding police and one to the Easton road crews. While Mr. McLiverty gathers information about the condition of the roads, Mr. Fossbender talks to John Bagioni, a meteorologist, who calls at 4:30 a.m. whenever snow, sleet or freezing rain are predicted. A weather service, the Connecticut Weather Center in Danbury, faxes an advisory to Mr. Fossbender, also at about 4:30. (The weather service and Mr. Bagioni always alert him the previous day if a storm is predicted.) He speaks to Mr. McLiverty again at 4:45 to receive an assessment of local roads and hear of any recommendations from the police or the officials in charge of the roads. Then Mr. Fossbender calls other superintendents. ''Between 4:50 and 5 the superintendents in the area have a conference call,'' he said. This conversation includes Bethel, Danbury, Ridgefield, Brookfield, New Fairfield, New Milford, Monroe and Newtown. He wants to know, 'What is their thinking?''' ''We have a sense of compared conditions,'' he said. ''Each person makes his own decision, but it gives you a context.'' If he chooses to delay or cancel school, he calls to activate an employee telephone chain. ''This is critical because we have a good number of staff members who live a good distance from school,'' he said. Also, school buses start rolling at 6:05 in Easton for arrival at Joel Barlow High School by 7:15, so timing is a crucial. On Monday, Mr. Fossbender called for a 90-minute delay. On Wednesday, he closed the five schools in his district. Anthony Mazzullo, the superintendent of Stamford, tries for a decision by 4:50. ''Five is our drop-dead time,'' he said, noting there is no going back. ''After 5 o'clock you can't say, 'I made a mistake.''' Meanwhile, to advise Mr. Fossbender and other superintendents, Bill Jacquemin, a meteorologist and owner of the Connecticut Weather Center, arises at 2 a.m. on stormy mornings to provide forecasts and advisories for the 18 school districts that subscribe to his service. By 4:15, he begins sending faxes that includes a forecast and recommendations. The type of precipitation, its timing and intensity influence those recommendations. ''Is snow supposed to end at sunup? I would say delay,'' he said. ''If snow will fall all day, I would recommend canceling.'' Icing is most likely to close schools because of slippery roads and downed wires and trees. Next in severity is a heavy snowfall with low temperatures and high winds, Mr. Jacquemin said. Confronted by extreme cold or wind chill, he might recommend a delayed opening so that the sun will be up, and with it the temperature, when students wait for buses or walk to school. Topographic and geographic differences from town to town, and even within some districts, complicate decision-making. In Mr. Fossbender's district, for instance, the northern part of Redding might have sleet or snow because of its higher elevation, while Easton residents, living closer to the coast, might see only rain. But Mr. Fossbender has to make his decision based on the more severe conditions in Redding. This helps to explain why Easton's children might still be in bed enjoying a delayed opening while students in neighboring Weston, with similar weather conditions, are already in the classroom. ''It is better to be conservative,'' Mr. Fossbender said. Weather conditions are even more extreme in Stamford. ''We literally have three climates zones,'' said Mr. Mazzullo, whose district encompasses 20 schools and 15,000 students. When it's drizzling in the Shippan section on the coast, a light snowfall might dust downtown, while the roads in wooded, hilly North Stamford are carpeted with snow. ''North Stamford generally determines if we have school or not,'' Mr. Mazzullo said. ''Will the roads be okay by 8?'' is what he asks his advisers. If so, he'll go for a delayed opening. The harder decision, he said, is when it looks like the roads won't be fine by 8 and trying to know that by 4:50 a.m. He decided to delay school on Monday. On Wednesday, schools were already closed for a staff development day. The hillier an area is, the more susceptible it is to delays and cancellations, Mr. Jacquemin said. Ridgefield and Wilton, for instance, close more readily than Westport. Snow removal capabilities are a factor, too. ''We have the equipment, the sanders and plows to do a nicer job than some of the smaller towns nearby,'' said Michael Frechette, the superintendent of schools in Norwich. Still, on Monday, although snow had stopped falling and the roads were passable, he decided to cancel school because of drifting snow in front of several school buildings. ''The crews had been working nonstop, but couldn't get in front of the storm because of 60 mile-an-hour winds,'' he said. That same morning, Stamford and Easton/Redding went with a delayed opening because of ice and drifts, while Darien and Norwalk, among others, opened on schedule. On Wednesday, when snow began in the morning and was predicted to continue till midday, the superintendents arose early again. Because of the timing of the snowfall, Mr. Jacquemin had recommended against a delay, explaining that conditions would get progressively worse in the morning, but snow would cease before dismissal time. Schools should open for the day or close for the day, he said on Tuesday. In Darien, Mary Jo Kramer, the superintendent, made the decision to delay at about 4:45 a.m. She soon realized that heavier snowfall was predicted for the very time that high school and middle school students would be going to school, so about an hour later she called the first snow day of the year. ''It was early enough,'' she said that she could reverse the decision. Larry Leverett, the Greenwich superintendent, said he called a weather service at 4:45 a.m., which said there would be no accumulation after 8 a.m. ''I was told by the Department of Public Works that they were satisfied with the road conditions,'' he said. ''We delayed opening for two hours to enable the public words department to attack the roads'' and clear snow from the schools. Did he make the right decision? ''I received mixed feedback,'' he said. Whether they opt to delay or cancel, getting the word out fast is imperative. The links on Mr. Fossbender's chain include making sure the media and the district Web master, who puts a notice on the school Web site by 5:10 a.m, are notified. Then he sends an e-mail message about ''the decision of the day'' to the Weather Center, which keeps a list of what schools are doing. Although helpful for parents and teachers planning their day, broadcasting a scheduling change the night before is uncommon. ''I don't like to do it because too many things can change,'' Mr. Frechette said. ''The information is better today, but until we can predict the weather with 100 percent accuracy there will be some we miss. It's judgment. You gather all the information you can and the Department of Public Works kind of tells you what to do.'' And even with the best information, errors are inevitable. ''You can check two or three weather forecasts, get two or three opinions and still be surprised, Mr. Mazzullo said. On Jan. 5, for example, Stamford and many other schools dismissed students early because of morning snow, but by the time most students arrived home the sun was out. On days like that, the phones start ringing in Mr. Mazzullo's office. ''How could make you make such a dumb mistake?'' he said people asked him. ''There are always people who think you're right and people who think you're wrong,'' he said. Early dismissals are the most troublesome option for administrators. Although they eliminate the need for a make-up day, letting young children out early is an administrative avalanche because parents and caretakers must be notified. ''I won't call an early dismissal unless I absolutely have to, even if it will take the buses three hours to get the kids home safely,'' Mr. Mazzullo said. In Mr. Jacquemin's experience, districts in the northern areas of the state are more likely to tough it out and keep schools open. The southern districts cancel more readily, perhaps because they're more populated, he said. Over all, though, delays and closings occur more frequently than in the past because of liability concerns, he said. ''Everyone is worried about lawsuits,'' he said. ''It used to be, 'School's important, take it slow and you'll be O.K.' Now they say, 'It's going to snow. Keep them home.''' Mr. Mazzullo said he disagreed. ''It's not fear of litigation,'' he said. ''It's because people don't use good judgment. We used to close less frequently. If the buses could get there, we'd be open and say, 'Get there when you can.' I have a much different attitude now. In Stamford, the roads can be really bad and you have kids taking cars to school and rushing to get there on time. I'd rather have a school day in June when the sun is shining than see a kid in an accident because of icy roads.'' Mr. Fossbender, who lives in Washington, about an hour away from his district, prefers to disrupt his sleep rather than risk allowing staff and students to head outdoors in unsafe conditions. ''Sometimes it's a nonevent,'' he said, ''but you better get up because in New England, you never know.''"
"EXTREME WEATHER A Guide & Record Book. By Christopher C. Burt. Cartography by Mark Stroud. Illustrated. 304 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. Paper, $24.95. THE sky is falling, temperatures are more extreme, tornadoes ravage the land, Buffalo is probably buried in snow at this very moment, and it is flooding somewhere in the world. Hailstones the size of pumpkins -- yes, pumpkins -- may be pummeling Bangladesh right now. Your town's temperature may hit a record high today. Or maybe a record low. Or your temperatures may reach a record high and a record low in a single 24-hour period. It happens: not necessarily at the same time all over the world -- that's a disaster movie scenario -- but pretty much every year there is a spate of appallingly anomalous weather somewhere, convincing most of us that the weather is changing, and for the worse. In 2004, Florida was pounded with a record four hurricanes in a single season, a disaster that cost 117 lives and destroyed 25,000 homes. In early January, five days of torrential rains in California triggered mudslides that killed at least 10 people. The same storm brought blizzard conditions to North Dakota, where the wind chill dropped to 50 below. And while it was more a geological event than a climatological one, a magnitude-9 earthquake off the north coast of Sumatra generated a tsunami that has, to date, killed some 150,000 people. Christopher C. Burt, the author of the excellent and addictive ''Extreme Weather: A Guide & Record Book,'' strives to put all this in context. He reminds us that, eons ago, the earth experienced some mind-boggling temperatures: there were glaciers in Wisconsin, and palm trees littered northern Canada. That's climate, of course, not weather. Weather happens in the short term, and we humans haven't been keeping reliable records all that long. ''In the United States,'' Burt writes, ''weather records have been maintained by the official weather services since about 1870. In the 50 preceding years, records were kept intermittently by individuals and by some institutions, including the Smithsonian Institution.'' The figures we have ''represent only a fraction of human experience with weather,'' but may be used as a ''yardstick'' to determine climatic trends. By this yardstick, the weather is not becoming more extreme. Burt, who was born in Manhattan in October 1954, during New York's most severe hurricane on record, was a prot√©g√© of the weather historian David M. Ludlum and studied meteorology at the University of Wisconsin. The man is obsessed with violent weather in the pleasantly dotty, accuracy-infatuated manner of someone in the throes of elucidating a lifelong passion. And while extreme weather fascinates him, Burt himself seems to have no desire actually to experience it. He lives in Oakland, described as ''a city of unremitting weather dullness.'' (Earthquakes, apparently, have no dominion over his imagination.) Burt spends but a single page on global warming. ''There is little debate over the fact that over the past 25 years or so global temperatures have risen significantly, and the trend has escalated since 1990.'' Why? Well, he points out that many weather stations have been moved from cities to nearby airports, where acres of asphalt radiate more heat. Some weather stations, previously in the countryside, have been absorbed into urban areas, which are warmer in the winter. Still, deserts are expanding, glaciers are melting, and Burt is obliged to note that ''recent studies'' indicate that an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ''is inextricably associated with global temperature change.'' How hot can it get? The weather station near Furnace Creek, Calif., in Death Valley, located 282 feet below sea level, records an average daily high of 115 degrees and a low of 87 degrees during July, making it the hottest location in North America and ''perhaps the hottest place in the world.'' Oddly, I found myself rooting for Death Valley in the worldwide temperature sweepstakes. The valley hit 134 degrees on July 10, 1913. That's the warmest temperature ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere, and is exceeded only by a reading of 136 degrees recorded in Al Aziziyah, Libya, and a ''questionable'' reading of 135 degrees in Algeria. The coldest reading in the United States was 79.8 degrees below zero at Prospect Creek, Alaska, on Jan. 23, 1971. Fort Yukon, Alaska, averaged 48.4 below zero during December 1917, the coldest American month on record. The coldest major city in the lower 48 is Minneapolis-St. Paul, where it hit 41 degrees below zero in January 1889. I am proud to point out that the lowest temperature ever reliably recorded in the lower 48 was in my home state of Montana, where it was 70 below at Rogers Pass on Jan. 20, 1954. I am also perversely proud of the fact that, on Jan. 14-15, 1972, the temperature in Loma, Mont., rose 103 degrees -- from 54 below to 49 above -- the greatest temperature change ever recorded anywhere during a 24-hour period. Burt's book is full of tables listing your state's highs and lows, its precipitation and snowfall records, but ''Extreme Weather'' also provides concise explanations for many of the odd and extreme phenomena he describes. For instance, I suspect many Americans may share my delight in the fact that our nation arguably experiences more severe thunderstorms than anywhere else on earth. Burt explains that this is a result of our unique geography: warm, unstable air from the subtropical waters of the Gulf of Mexico collides with cold, dry sub-Arctic air sweeping down from the north. Unlike Europe or Asia, America has no mountains running east to west to separate these antagonists. This country is made for lightning storms and torrential rains and heavy floods and hailstorms. In fact, the largest American hailstone ever measured -- a veritable volleyball, seven inches across -- fell in Aurora, Neb., in June 2003. It's disappointing to learn this was not the largest authenticated hailstone in the world. That honor belongs to the Gopalganj district of Bangladesh, where, in 1986, a stone weighed in at 2.25 pounds. ''Its diameter,'' Burt says, ''was not reported, although anecdotal evidence points to stones the size of 'pumpkins.' '' THERE are appendixes at the end of ''Extreme Weather,'' giving city and state snow, precipitation and temperature records. What's remarkable is that almost every place in America seems to hold a record for some bit of exceptional weather. You probably live in, or near, the wettest or the driest place, the windiest or most calm area, the coldest or the hottest place or the one most prone to tornadoes or hurricanes. Something happened where you live: something either fierce or strange or wondrous. For example, a dust storm over Illinois on April 11, 1902, lifted an immense quantity of dirt into the air. Winds pushed this dirt east, where it was sucked into storm clouds, and the next day it rained mud in New York. Burt's book explores killer floods, swirling dust storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, hail, snow and windstorms, as well as ''mud rains'' falling over New York. The weather in some places is extreme in its very lack of extremity. Honolulu is the major American city that exhibits the least extreme absolute range of temperature, which is 43 degrees (52 degrees to 95 degrees). I suspect the locals rarely feel as though the sky were falling. Perhaps there are some who, after spending another predictably perfect day in paradise, occasionally wish that it would. Tim Cahill is the author of nine books, including ''Lost in My Own Backyard: A Walk in Yellowstone National Park.'' He lives near the Yellowstone Plateau, the fourth-coldest region in the United States."
"Air travel remained a mess, but highways and many streets were passable, railroads ran mostly on time and New York metropolitan area residents began digging out yesterday as a powerful weekend storm that buried much of the Northeast under a foot or two of snow churned out into the Atlantic. As the trailing edge of the vast storm passed, blue skies and brilliant sunshine broke through the gloom just after noon in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. And as if on cue, battalions of shovelers, sledders, skiers and dog-walkers emerged from a day of hibernation -- bundled up against 20-degree cold and 30-mile-an-hour winds -- to labor and frolic in the drifts. But with 12 to 18 inches of snow on the ground in New York City and 18 to 21 inches in parts of New Jersey, Long Island and Connecticut, a huge cleanup remained. City officials said the snowplows would be out all night, and the commuter railroads and bus lines said this morning's commute would be near normal, if the hordes that usually drive to work heed the officials' advice to use mass transit. A fire in a subway signal relay room, however, meant that service on the A and C lines, two of the city's busiest, would be suspended or sharply reduced throughout today, transit officials said. Five storm-related deaths were reported in the city, including that of a 10-year-old Brooklyn girl who was struck by a city plow as she played in a snowbank at Wolcott and Richards Streets in Red Hook. The driver, who apparently did not notice the child, drove away and was being sought, the police said. Four other people died, apparently of heart attacks, while shoveling snow, city officials said. A woman was killed by a Long Island Rail Road train at the Malverne station, but it was not clear whether the death was weather-related. New York City schools will be open today, but all after-school programs and field trips have been canceled, said Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Education. Some buses may be canceled or delayed, she noted. In New Jersey and Connecticut, the decision to open late or cancel classes is usually made by individual districts. The morning forecast called for sunshine and temperatures in the 20's. The aftermath of the storm brought a quiet loveliness to the landscape. The snow filled country hollows, painted the corners of windowpanes and left creamy sculptures atop homes and fences. Cars were buried at curbsides by plowed snow or drifts, but owners were told not to worry: The city has suspended alternate-side parking regulations until Saturday. Jeff Warner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University, called the storm memorable but hardly a record-breaker in New York. ''This will be in the top five January snowstorms since 1900,'' he said. January, perhaps because it is the coldest month on average, is less snowy, he noted. As recorded by the National Weather Service, accumulations in the city totaled 13.8 inches in Central Park and up to 17.5 inches in Brooklyn, 15.5 inches in Queens and 17 inches on Staten Island. On Long Island, West Babylon had 19.6 inches, Baiting Hollow 19, the Hamptons 18 and Farmingdale 16.5. In New Jersey, Rutherford in Bergen County and West Milford in Passaic County both had 21 inches. In Connecticut, Old Saybrook had 17 inches, and Milford and Montville Center 18.5 each. The girl killed by the snowplow, identified by the police as Markita Weaver, was sitting atop a large snowdrift waiting for a friend to cross a street when a city plow drove by and struck her about 3 p.m., police and witnesses said. As the driver turned right from Richards Street onto Wolcott Street, he struck the girl and her friend ran to her sister, who was in an apartment nearby, said Paris A. Salley, 23, who lives in the building. He said he came down and saw Markita covered in snow, bleeding from her face. ''There was blood everywhere,'' Mr. Salley said. Police and sanitation investigators inspected four snowplows that had covered the area, but found no evidence, the authorities said. In the New York area, it was an air traveler's nightmare. Thousands of passengers were stymied by flight cancellations and delays. All three metropolitan airports -- Kennedy International, Newark Liberty International and La Guardia -- remained open throughout the storm, but few flights got out, and passengers checked into airport hotels or camped out in airline lounges. More than 1,200 flights were canceled as of 7 p.m. yesterday -- 400 at La Guardia, 454 at Newark and 380 at Kennedy -- atop the 700 cancellations at the three airports on Saturday, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reported. Even for flights getting out, there were extensive delays at La Guardia. Passengers at home were told it would be folly to go to an airport without checking with their airlines. The AirTrain remained shut down yesterday at both Newark and Kennedy Airports, and travelers relied on buses to take them to terminals. One passenger trying to fly home to Minneapolis, Mark O. Sullivan, said he arrived more than two and a half hours early for his flight, but still missed it because of the long lines to get on the buses. ''They've had since Saturday night to be ready for this, and they still aren't,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''There's nobody there who knows what is going on, and there's no other way to get to airplanes.'' The Long Island Rail Road reported several disruptions, including a morning suspension of service between Great Neck and Port Washington because of a power problem. Service on the Ronkonkoma branch was suspended later for plowing. Brian P. Dolan, a spokesman, predicted a near-normal rush today, with 10- to 15-minute delays. Metro-North Railroad, which normally runs 320 trains on a Sunday, cut service to a quarter of that yesterday, to one train every two hours on most of its lines to keep the fleet in working order -- especially the older diesels on the New Haven line -- for this morning's commute, said Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman. ''It was a conscious and, I believe, prudent decision to limit service during the height of the storm in order to preserve the fleet and prepare for the morning rush tomorrow,'' she said. The railroad began adding trains about 4 p.m. yesterday and said it would restore full service by this morning, she said. New Jersey Transit, which operates rail and bus services across the state and into Manhattan, noted that Amtrak, which uses some of the same tracks and switches on its Northeast Corridor, was planning to restrict switch movements today. As a result, New Jersey Transit said it would limit its corridor trains to every 15 minutes between 5 and 10 a.m. between Trenton and New York. In addition, it said, diesel trains will be run on the North Jersey Coast Line, and on its Morris and Essex Lines its Midtown Direct service will run to and from Hoboken, where customers may connect to a PATH train for New York. New Jersey Transit trains, buses and light-rail trains were running on or close to schedule yesterday. There were, in retrospect, relatively few power failures in the metropolitan area. The Jersey Central Power and Light Company, serving central and northern New Jersey, reported that about 1,000 customers were briefly without power in scattered areas of Monmouth and Ocean Counties early yesterday. In Connecticut, about 2,200 homes were blacked out. The apparent reason, said Mr. Warner of Penn State, was that the snow was relatively dry. Unlike wet snow, dry flakes are light and fluffy and do not weigh down and snap tree branches and power lines. Dry snow is also easier to shovel and plow. But there is one downside, Mr. Warner noted: It does not make a good, hard-packed snowball. SNOWSTORM IN THE NORTHEAST: OVERVIEW"
"It's a simple transaction. No benefits, no drug tests. Few questions asked. To earn $9 an hour from New York City for shoveling snow, applicants need only be 18 or older, have a strong back and prove that they can legally work in the United States. Serina Cooper, a 30-year-old single mother from the Lower East Side, was one of 657 people who met those requirements yesterday. Ms. Cooper, whose main source of income is the $250 or so she earns each week from promoting salsa clubs, said she could use the extra money to buy new sneakers for her 12-year-old son, Brandon, or save toward a vacation that never seems to materialize. Leaving her son with her best friend, she went to the sanitation station at Pier 36 on the Lower East Side yesterday morning. The foreman stared at the white sneakers on her feet. ''You don't have boots?'' he asked. ''No,'' she said. She was wearing two pairs of pants, four shirts, a sweatshirt and a coat, but no boots. Even her gloves were lent by friends. The foreman shook his head. Ms. Cooper then headed out to work on East Broadway with a five-person crew to clear sidewalks, ramps, fire hydrants and bus stations during a seven-hour shift. ''It's a way to get out there,'' she said, taking a break at the corner of Montgomery Street and East Broadway, ''earn some extra money, have a little fun in the snow and help the community.'' Still, she found it to be numbing work. ''It's cold, you're aching, and you just look forward to getting home,'' she said as the hours wore on and the temperature fell. Snow, which appears so light and magical as it drifts toward the earth, ossifies on the ground into a formidable enemy. As the crew members worked, they often fell silent. The only sounds were metallic scraping, heavy breathing and the whoosh of snow flying through the air. For her half-hour break, Ms. Cooper sought refuge in a nearby McDonald's, where she sat down at a table near another crew member, Juan Rivera, 39. ''You want lunch?'' Mr. Rivera asked, noticing that Ms. Cooper wasn't eating. ''No. I'm good. I'm good,'' she insisted. ''You sure you don't want anything to eat?'' He pulled out a $10 bill for her. Ms. Cooper hesitated, took it and ordered a coffee and a cheeseburger. It came to $2.26. She handed the change back to him. Walking back to the site, Mr. Rivera said in a fatherly way, ''I'll bring you some work boots tomorrow.'' SNOWSTORM IN THE NORTHEAST: THE WORKERS"
"It was a steel-gray Sunday, not even two weeks since Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had delivered an upbeat speech on New York's condition, and the state of the city had taken a grim turn. The five boroughs were digging out from a windswept blizzard. An apartment house fire in the Bronx had killed two firefighters and critically injured four others. Now, as Mr. Bloomberg was leaving St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, where he had delivered the devastating news to families of the dead firefighters, word of yet another tragedy came: A firefighter responding to a blaze in Brooklyn was near death. ''The gods are not smiling on us today,'' the mayor said to no one in particular, and climbed into his car for what would be the second of three hospital visits yesterday. Mishandled, any of the weekend's events had the potential to cause grave political damage to any mayor. And Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire businessman known more for his pragmatism than his emotional connection to voters, has chosen to make managerial skills a key rationale for his continued tenure in City Hall, raising the stakes whenever events conspire to test the very qualities that he has claimed as his. It is a test that previous mayors sometimes failed. When a snowstorm crippled the city and left streets impassable during Mayor John V. Lindsay's administration, the public turned on him. ''It's a classic story in New York, the city's inability, under Lindsay, to get the snow off the streets,'' said William B. Eimicke, a professor of public administration at Columbia University. ''It led to the reputation that he couldn't get the trains to run on time.'' Yesterday, it was Mr. Bloomberg who was feeling the pressure, as he faces what opinion polls show to be an extremely tight race for re-election. The public face of the mayor that emerged during the day was the orderly, attentive chief executive, a role that has served him well during past crises, like the blackout of August 2003, when New Yorkers applauded his performance. The day began hopefully enough, with the year's first major snowstorm finally pulling away and cleanup crews blessed with not having to deal with weekday traffic. The mayor's public schedule was relatively light, with the major event a 1 p.m. news conference on storm cleanup efforts at the Office of Emergency Management command center in Brooklyn. After being awakened periodically Saturday night for storm updates, Mr. Bloomberg rose at 7 a.m., walked five miles on a treadmill, ate breakfast and was preparing to meet with his staff at 9 when his press secretary, Edward Skyler, called with news of the Bronx fire. Within 10 minutes, the mayor was on his way to St. Barnabas, where fire officials briefed him on the tragedy. An aide who accompanied him throughout the day said Mr. Bloomberg broke the news of Lt. Curtis Meyran's death to Lieutenant Meyran's wife when she arrived at the hospital, and then went with her to view her husband's body. The mayor stayed with the firefighters' families for two hours before leaving for Jacobi Medical Center, where another firefighter from the Bronx blaze was being treated. By the time Mr. Bloomberg arrived at Jacobi, he had received word that the firefighter injured in Brooklyn had died. The mayor cancelled his planned appearance at the news conference on storm cleanup, and instead headed to Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, where the firefighter's family was gathering. As the mayor made his rounds, the television interview he had taped with WCBS-TV was first postponed and then interrupted because of storm coverage. In it, Mr. Bloomberg spoke of his accomplishments during his first years in office and hinted that he had learned from the mistakes of previous mayors. ''In terms of day in and day out,'' he said, ''the type of things that I'm worrying about are what La Guardia said were neither a Republican or a Democratic thing, but the basic services. That's what I'm focusing on.'' SNOWSTORM IN THE NORTHEAST: THE MAYOR"
"Simply crossing the street was a death-defying mission for Kathleen Farley on Sunday, with her hometown, Chatham, clobbered with snow and scissored with wind in one of New England's worst winter storms. ''It's just total whiteout,'' said Ms. Farley, who made a valiant effort to cross Main Street in Chatham, at the elbow of Cape Cod, to check on her business, the Red Nun Restaurant and Bar. ''Unless you have goggles, you can't even see. It was scary because we couldn't see if a snowplow was coming, and the wind is so loud that you couldn't hear if a plow was coming either.'' Down at the Chatham lighthouse, where meteorologists frequently go to measure weather conditions, Ms. Farley said, ''The weathermen couldn't even stand up: it's hurricane meets blizzard.'' Winter walloped Massachusetts and southern New England relentlessly for nearly 24 hours with indefatigable snow and brutish blasts of wind. By Sunday afternoon, some parts of Massachusetts that had already wrestled with weeks of terrible winter weather had more than three feet of glistening new snow, and the wind was stacking drifts more than twice that high. The National Weather Service in Taunton, Mass., issued an urgent warning on Sunday morning, telling residents, ''If you leave the safety of being indoors, you are putting your life at risk.'' The service said that in some places snow was falling at a rate of an inch every 10 minutes. At least one death in the region was attributed to the weather. That person, David Nyhan, 64, a former political columnist for The Boston Globe, collapsed while shoveling snow. Some coastal communities were the hardest hit. The entire island of Nantucket lost power Sunday morning, leaving about 9,400 year-round residents without lights and, in some cases, heat. Residents with electric-powered wells had no running water. The National Weather Service recorded wind gusts up to 84 miles per hour, 10 m.p.h. faster than minimum hurricane-force winds, and there were 28-foot waves on the ocean. ''The wind is blowing so hard that the house keeps getting darker and darker, because the drifts of snow keep piling up on the windows,'' said Virginia Kinney, 63. Beverly Hall, a photographer, said she and her husband were without heat, lights and plumbing. ''We've been out getting buckets of snow to melt on our gas stove so we'll have drinking and cooking water, cleaning water, flushing toilets in an emergency,'' Ms. Hall said. About 13,000 people on Cape Cod lost electricity, as did about 5,000 in the South Shore suburbs of Boston. And when the midmorning high tide hit the town of Scituate, south of Boston, the waves breached the seawall and drove water as far as 500 feet inland. A few dozen people had to evacuate their homes with the help of the National Guard, said Peter Judge, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. Logan International Airport was closed all day Sunday, as were airports in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Massachusetts remained under a state of emergency, declared by Gov. Mitt Romney on Saturday afternoon. In Rhode Island, Gov. Donald L. Carcieri also imposed a state of emergency and declared that all state and municipal offices would be closed on Monday. For some the saving grace of the storm was that the New England Patriots missed it. The Patriots won in Pittsburgh on Sunday, and many a fan endured the sacrifice of having to stay snowed in by parking in front of the television set. Some people ventured out to trudge or ski the streets, or to go to work. But the paucity of outdoor adventurers helped make the snowstorm much less hazardous than it could have been, said Mr. Judge of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. ''It's turned out to be a pretty light and fluffy snow for most of the state, relatively easy to plow,'' he said, and also not heavy enough to damage too many power lines. Jason Carriero, 28, who spent three hours shoveling in the Brighton neighborhood of Boston, said: ''It's not like you have to be a weightlifter to move it. If we had almost three feet of snowman-making snow, we'd be snowed in for two weeks.'' Fox Butterfield contributed reporting from Hingham, Mass., for this article; Sasha Cavender from Nantucket, Mass.; and Katie Zezima from Boston."
"Gary Burton, the Wayland superintendent of schools, insists that his having grown up in Newfoundland is not the reason he decided to open the schools Monday in this western suburb of Boston. So what if almost every other school district in eastern Massachusetts was closed, grappling with the aftermath of a blizzard that left much of the region nearly paralyzed by hip-deep snow, blistering winds and biting cold? ''It's New England,'' Dr. Burton said. ''It's going to snow.'' But even in this hardy community, where parents are well aware that the schools rarely close, the weekend's ferocious northeaster was too much for many. ''A number of parents have called to tell me that I guessed wrong,'' Dr. Burton acknowledged. ''It's running about 60-40 against me today. Mostly it seems to center around road conditions. And some of the town's sidewalks have not been plowed, so some children are forced to walk in the roads, which I agree they should not be doing. Some parents are also asking, if all these other schools have closed, what do I know that they don't know. I do think there are some parents who -- well, today I'm not one of their favorite people.'' In most places in the region, from Boston to Hyannis to Gloucester, communities capitulated to the elements: schools, courts, government offices and many businesses remained shut. ''We just can't handle it,'' said Bob Burns, the emergency management operations officer for the town of Plymouth, which tied with Salem for the most snow in the state: 38 inches, according to the National Weather Service. ''Our plows and stuff just can't move this kind of stuff around,'' Mr. Burns said. ''We've had a lot of our equipment get stuck. We called in the National Guard to use front-end loaders to move the snow -- heavy, heavy equipment.'' Mr. Burns said that while much of the state had gotten light, fluffy snow, Plymouth and some other coastal areas had been hit by the heavy, wet variety, which snapped power lines and left some people without heat, forced to take refuge in an emergency shelter. On Cape Cod, smothered with three feet of snow and with conditions so dire that for the first time in memory The Cape Cod Times did not publish a newspaper on Monday (it did turn out an online edition), Adrienne Morosini, Dana Heilman and their two children were still trapped in their house in Harwich as of Monday afternoon. Twelve years of experience on the Cape had taught them that ''usually it doesn't snow that much, and if it does it melts pretty quickly,'' Ms. Morosini, a real estate agent, said by telephone. Anyway, their four-wheel-drive vehicles are usually able to navigate any snow that falls. But, Ms. Morosini said, ''our driveway is about 500 yards long, and the snowdrifts in some places are eight feet tall.'' ''We don't have a regular plow guy,'' she said. ''We made calls, and now we're just begging people to come and get us.'' They put a sign at the end of their driveway: ''Plow for Money,'' with their phone number. And they hunkered down, glad that unlike Sunday, this was a day with electricity and heat. Boston, meanwhile, where the temperature was as low as 3 degrees early Monday morning, was a frigid white labyrinth, with shoveled sidewalks wedged alongside mountains of snow. On fashionable Newbury Street, where crossing pedestrians needed to scale a three-foot-high snowbank to get to the sidewalk, Elissa Bjorck, 19, was at work at Jasmine Sola, a clothing store selling spring-break attire: bikinis, sun hats and a hot-pink sleeveless dress. Only one customer showed up Monday morning, but ''people have come in here just to keep warm,'' Ms. Bjorck said. The extreme weather resulted in at least one death in Massachusetts. The Boston Police Department said a 10-year-old boy from the Roxbury section died of carbon monoxide poisoning Sunday after sitting in a running parked car whose tailpipe was blocked by piled-up snow and ice. Logan Airport, closed for nearly 30 hours beginning Sunday morning, reopened but was then hounded by an hourlong electrical failure that stopped elevators and escalators and slowed passenger check-in to a crawl. And on Nantucket, where the entire island lost power on Sunday and many were still without electricity Monday, about 100 people were staying at an emergency shelter at the high school. A family with a 10-month-old baby took refuge at the shelter after winds blew the glass out of their storm door Sunday. ''That's how I got out,'' said the baby's mother, who did not want to give her name. ''I climbed through the broken glass. The drifts made it impossible otherwise. I couldn't open the door.''"
"As it turns out, you can teach an old railroad new tricks. On the first business day after the biggest snowstorm to hit the Northeast this season, the Metro-North Railroad carried commuters in and out of New York City yesterday, a feat it miserably failed to pull off after the blizzard of 1996. Even though as many as 19 inches of snow fell on some parts of its service area, Metro-North ran most of its trains with minor delays during the morning commuter rush. More than half the morning trains ran on time and those that were late arrived just 11 minutes past due, on average, said Dan Brucker, a spokesman for Metro-North. That was a remarkable improvement from nine years ago, when a blizzard that hit on a Sunday in January crippled the railroad for most of a week. This time, in a turnabout, Metro-North reported fewer problems and delays than other commuter services in the region. On the Long Island Rail Road, which like Metro-North is managed by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, six out of seven morning trains were late and the average delay was 24 minutes. Brian Dolan, a spokesman for the Long Island Rail Road, said that blowing snow could disable more cars, forcing the railroad to combine some scheduled trains. For some New Jersey commuters, the trip to work lasted twice as long as usual. New Jersey Transit's trains along the Northeast Corridor were delayed throughout the morning by restrictions laid down by Amtrak, which owns the tracks, and by a switch malfunction near Newark Penn Station, said Dan Stessel, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit. During the height of the rush, delays averaged about 45 minutes and ran as long as an hour, he said. By late morning, New Jersey Transit's service was returning to a normal schedule, except that Midtown Direct trains continued to run to and from Hoboken instead of Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. At the region's airports, flights were leaving and arriving on schedule by midafternoon after the storm forced hundreds of flight cancellations Saturday and Sunday. Hundreds of schools were closed or delayed opening as city and state workers finished digging out from a snowfall that ranged from several inches to more than 19 inches in some parts of Long Island and New Jersey. The Long Island Power Authority reported that 26,000 customers lost power, but most service was restored within two to three hours. In New York City, sanitation workers were too busy trying to clear the streets to ticket property owners who had failed to clear their sidewalks, a spokeswoman said. Compared with the blizzard of 1996, the snowfall was a little lighter and it came earlier in the weekend, but for Metro-North officials, the biggest difference was that they learned a few lessons after that disaster. First of all, they ducked. With the storm approaching on Friday, they began planning to move their older train cars under the cover of Grand Central Terminal, protecting them from the snow and cold. Many of the cars, especially on the New Haven line, which runs through Connecticut, are at least 30 years old. On Saturday, they operated only those older cars whose electrical systems had been overhauled recently. Then on Sunday, they switched to diesel engines and ran them less frequently: every two hours. ''We have made a vast change in how we operate,'' Mr. Brucker said. ''We don't strictly throw the equipment out there to do or die.'' Having avoided the risk of burning out trains in the storm, Metro-North had most of its fleet of 800 cars ready to roll on Monday morning. None of the trains lost power and became stuck along the tracks, as many had in 1996. Only two had to be replaced during their runs and none was late by more than 30 minutes. ''All in all, it was pretty successful,'' Peter A. Cannito, the president of Metro-North, said. Mr. Cannito said he was particularly surprised by the performance of the reconditioned old cars, which are products of a five-year, $130 million program financed by the M.T.A. and the Connecticut Department of Transportation. The cars had frequently broken down in snowy weather because their antiquated components had been poorly shielded. But the revamped versions ran without fail, he said. Mr. Cannito said he wished he had more of them. So far, only 68 of the line's 240 oldest cars have had their systems replaced. Updating the rest should take almost four more years, said James Boice, the interim chief for public transportation in Connecticut's Transportation Department. Mr. Boice also chalked up the improvement in the post-blizzard performance to planning. Over the weekend, Metro-North went to Level 5, its highest state of contingency planning, he said. ''We're only going to do that with major storms,'' Mr. Boice said. ''I think it showed we learned from '96.'' That education was evident to Karl Lauby, a Greenwich Village resident who rides Metro-North daily to work at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. After the 1996 storm, Mr. Lauby faulted Metro-North officials for failing to disclose just how chaotic the situation was. Yesterday, Mr. Lauby said he expected the commuting to be a slog. But when he reached the platform at Grand Central, his usual 8:24 a.m. departure was pulling out. It was on time, but he was late because of a subway delay."
"Markita Jimenez Weaver could not wait. On Sunday afternoon in Brooklyn, the snow had finally stopped falling, and the corner of Wolcott and Richards Streets in Red Hook lay beneath a fluffy white blanket. Markita, a tall, big-eyed girl of 10, went into the A&K grocery store with a friend and got plastic bags to put over her sneakers. The transaction was captured on videotape, the police said. While her friend struggled to pull on her makeshift boots, Markita crossed the street and threw herself on top of a snowbank, said Vincent Aviles, 14, who was standing in front of the store. ''She was sitting on the snow pile making a snow angel with her arms,'' Vincent said yesterday. ''She was happy as can be, telling her friend, 'Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!''' A few seconds later, a vehicle that Vincent and other witnesses said was a city snowplow truck came down Richards, turned the corner tightly onto Wolcott, and slowly plowed on. When the truck was gone, Vincent said, so was Markita. ''She was pushed into the pile of snow,'' he said. ''All we could see was her hood.'' When rescuers dug Markita out, they could see she was unconscious and bleeding. She died soon after at the Long Island College Hospital. Twenty-four hours later, the family of Markita, the youngest of six children and a newly fledged Girl Scout, was still waiting for an explanation or even an acknowledgment. ''All my mom wants is an apology,'' Markita's brother Jesse Jimenez, 26, said in the dim hallway outside the family's ninth-floor apartment in the Red Hook West public housing project. ''The driver doesn't have to show his face. Just call my mom and apologize. He can just hang up the phone. The commissioner from Sanitation could call my mom. The mayor. Somebody. Just to give their respects.'' But Markita's mother, Maria Jimenez, a school bus matron, has received no call, officials said, because the police have not even been able to confirm that it was a city truck that struck Markita. Investigators went to the Sanitation Department depot on Second Avenue nearby, examined all four trucks that were plowing near Markita's street on Sunday, and found no blood or other evidence, the police said. ''They're re-interviewing witnesses they spoke to last night,'' Sgt. Mary Christine Doherty, a police spokeswoman, said yesterday. ''They're canvassing the area for new witnesses.'' Keith Mellis, a Sanitation Department spokesman, said that plow drivers were given very specific routes, but he refused to answer any more questions, referring the matter to the police. On the corner where Markita was struck, right in front of her school, Public School 15, mourners filed by all day yesterday, writing condolences on a cardboard beer case that held 11 memorial candles. ''She was a sweet kid,'' said Trequan Bekka, 16, who was an intern in an after-school program at P.S. 15 and often supervised Markita. ''She never bothered nobody.'' Edwin Santiago, 14, agreed. ''She had a good head on her shoulders,'' he said. ''She was headed somewhere good.''"
"Search crews retrieved the body of a 27-year-old man on Sunday, two days after a massive avalanche near a ski resort, and the authorities said that only two other skiers may have died. The body of the victim, Shane Maixner of Sandpoint, Idaho, was found under four feet of snow about 10 a.m. by a searcher working with a trained dog in the north end of the snow slide, Sheriff Dave Edmunds of Summit County said. Mr. Maixner's body has been taken to the Utah State Medical Examiner's Office for an autopsy. The authorities had feared that up to five people died in the avalanche Friday. But after going to hotels and homes over the weekend to track down people initially reported missing or having skied in the area of the avalanche, they said there were, at most, three people unaccounted for. ''We have found the individual we absolutely, categorically knew was in that debris field,'' Sheriff Edmunds told The Associated Press. ''Hopefully, there won't be any more.'' Asked how many skiers may still be missing on the mountainside, the sheriff said: ''Maybe two more. But all of that is unsubstantiated.'' Late Sunday, Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. flew over the area in a helicopter, met with Sheriff Edmunds and thanked searchers for their efforts. Scores of searchers, assisted by dogs, have been scouring the mountainside since Friday. Even before his body was found, Mr. Maixner was as a likely victim. A friend who was on the slopes with him on Friday had called a 911 operator to report that he saw Mr. Maixner swept away. ''We feel terrible,'' Sheriff Edmunds said as he announced the finding of the body. ''Our hearts go out to his family. But in a way this is positive in that there might not be more people in there. As time progresses, we're eliminating names.'' The death of Mr. Maixner brings to seven the number of avalanche deaths in Utah this year, the highest since records began being consistently kept in 1951. Utah's deadliest avalanche on record, the Bingham Canyon avalanche on Feb. 17, 1926, killed 36 people and left 13 injured. Friday's avalanche, which followed weeks of heavy, wet snow, occurred near the Canyons, a resort on federal land. The avalanche, which happened about 1 p.m., broke near a ridgeline just south of the ski resort's boundaries in an area that was marked off limits because of the danger of avalanches. The slide was 500 yards wide at the top and half a mile long. It could have occurred naturally, but 90 percent of the time avalanches are triggered by people, the authorities said. While skiing out of bounds is often illegal, some backcountry can be safely skied. One local backcountry skier, Jeb Griffiths, said he was on the slopes the day before the avalanche. But Mr. Griffiths said that he also took extra precautions, including skiing with a companion and being equipped with a probe, a beacon and a shovel. Authorities suspect that those who might have been trapped by Friday's avalanche were not as well equipped or familiar with the terrain. The danger of more avalanches remains high, the authorities said. Nevertheless, about 200 searchers returned to the area Sunday morning and used radar to try to detect possible victims, hoping to get a read from metal on boots, bindings, snowboards, skis or ski poles. Relatives of Mr. Maixner told The Associated Press that he graduated in December from the University of Montana with a pre-med degree. He had just moved to Idaho to live with his sister and was looking for a job in Utah as a physician's assistant, said his father, Joel Maixner, who lives in North Dakota. ''If anybody could have survived, it would have been Shane,'' his father told The A.P. ''He was in excellent condition. But the sheriff told me his head and chest were slammed into a tree. He died without a fight.''"
"Yesterday was the kind of morning when you poured water onto the Corn Flakes. No sense running to the corner bodega if you were out of milk. The TV was showing temperatures that would look right on the jerseys of quarterbacks and kickers. And there were rumblings of a storm to come. All through the windows, if you were lucky enough to have them, came fat beams of double-crossing sunshine, promising warmth that would not be delivered, not yesterday and not for a long while. It was cold out there. Still, you couldn't call it unexpected. It was mid-January already, late January really, and the forecasters were finally calling for the first big snowstorm of the season, one to make up for lost wintertime. ''We're in for, pretty much, a doozy for the weekend,'' said Michael Silva, a National Weather Service meteorologist. ''So far we've been pretty lucky, we've been pretty mild.'' The weather service was calling for a storm to cover everything over, with Arctic air masses taking advantage of a dip in the jet stream and low pressure moving across the Ohio Valley, and for snow to start falling on Saturday afternoon and to leave 12 to 15 inches on the ground, ending by Sunday afternoon. There was a blizzard warning, too, for winds stronger than 35 miles an hour to blow that snow around. The best advice, the written warning said, is ''TO STAY INDOORS.'' Across the city, people seemed to welcome that advice. ''There's a storm?'' asked a clerk at Reel Life, a video store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. ''Excellent. I'm going to watch some football, smoke some weed and chill out.'' Renee Price, a student at New York City College of Technology, who was walking down Jay Street yesterday in a hat, scarf and long coat, was making indoor plans, too. ''I'm going to go outside and pick up the paper at 6 a.m., sneak back inside and read,'' Ms. Price said. ''The heat is already set, the mood is right and the coffee will be on at 7.'' Those with work to do were less enthusiastic, but they too bowed to the storm. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said it would suspend nearly all planned subway construction over the weekend. FreshDirect, a company that delivers groceries, was making backup plans. ''If our employees can get here, we're going to trudge through the snow,'' said Steve Druckman, a company spokesman. And real estate brokers were canceling open houses. ''People are saying, 'If you have somebody to show to, call me and I'll go,''' said Steven Rutter, managing director of the Corcoran Group's office in Park Slope. Property owners, he said, ''don't want people traipsing in with snowy boots, snowy strollers, snowy kids.'' The forecasters could be wrong, but Mr. Silva seemed confident. ''Most of our models are in agreement; it doesn't look like they're going to be wrong,'' he said. Yeah, but what if they are? ''We could see 8 to 12 inches of snow, or we could see more.''"
"Blizzards and high winds through the nation's center stranded thousands of Thanksgiving travelers on Sunday and yesterday as several major highways were closed. At least four people died in weather-related car accidents, and many travelers found themselves unexpectedly staying in shelters and hotels as they waited for highways to reopen in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota. ''We were concerned that we might have to spend the night in the car,'' said Beulah Brown, 68, who stayed at a shelter set up at the National Guard Armory in Russell, Kan., on Sunday night and last night on her way home from Wichita to Morland, Kan. ''I think we'll be lucky if we get to go home tomorrow.'' Some 240 people stayed at the armory and the Russell County 4-H building yesterday, eating chicken, noodles and carrots for dinner and playing cards and watching movies to pass the time. Some were anxious about missing work but were for the most part in good spirits, said John Degand, a Red Cross volunteer. Wind speeds rose to 69 miles per hour in parts of Colorado and Kansas yesterday, prompting blizzard warnings and snow drifts as high as six feet in some places, said Jeremy Martin, a forecaster for the National Weather Service. A 275-mile stretch of Interstate 70 in Kansas and Colorado was closed yesterday. More than 20 cars had been in accidents on a five-mile stretch of the Interstate on Sunday as a result of poor visibility. ''There were just cars everywhere,'' said Eric Wynn, a spokesman for the Colorado State Patrol. ''We were just going from crash to crash.'' Interstate 90 was closed across much of South Dakota yesterday. In Nebraska, a 200-mile stretch of the Interstate 80 was closed, and an inch of ice accumulated on power lines, causing power failures in 10 counties. There were winds of up to 60 m.p.h. and more than a foot of snow in the central part of the state, said Brian Hirsch, a forecaster for the National Weather Service in North Platte, Neb. ''Mother Nature makes the road crews' attempts nil,'' Mr. Hirsch said. ''They knock down the drifts, but the drifts come right back.'' Two people in Kansas and one each in South Dakota and Nebraska died on Sunday and yesterday after drivers lost control. A 33-year-old man died in Arkansas on Sunday when a tornado that was part of the same storm system picked up the car he was in and flipped it over on an Interstate. Tornadoes in Kansas and Arkansas on Sunday also damaged 32 homes at Fort Riley, Kan., and knocked out power to 8,000 customers in Arkansas."
"A powerful, fast-moving storm left a trail of heavy, wet snow on Friday from the Great Lakes to New England, causing hazardous road conditions, flight delays and school cancellations. New England bore the brunt of the storm, with blizzardlike conditions whipping across the region, dumping more than a foot of snow in parts of Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. The storm is blamed for at least 12 traffic deaths, including that of a trucker whose tractor-trailer skidded into a median on Thursday on Interstate 75 outside Piqua, Ohio. The driver was killed after another tractor-trailer traveling in the opposite direction struck his cab, said Lt. Rick Zwayer of the Ohio State Police. Forecasters at the National Weather Service in Gray, Me., said some coastal towns, including Old Orchard, Me., received up to seven inches of snow in a single hour in the afternoon. Sanford, Me., had 14.5 inches of snow, while Durbinton, N.H., received nearly 16 inches. ''It is a fairly widespread snowstorm, in that it impacted places from the Plains to the Upper Ohio Valley to the Northeast, and I would say that is not what the average storm will do,'' said Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. Coastal Massachusetts received winds of up to 60 miles per hour, knocking out power to at least 32,000 residents in southeastern Massachusetts and Cape Cod, according to local utility companies. Mr. Miner said New York City received six inches of snow, one of only a few times the city has seen that much snow so early in the season. The northern parts of the region received the most snow, with parts of Orange County, N.Y., recording 13 inches and parts of Westchester County, N.Y., recording 10 inches. Areas of New Jersey just north of the city had six inches of snow. Long Island, which received mostly rain, was buffeted by high winds that contributed to the loss of power for 6,600 utility customers. By late afternoon, electricity had been restored to all but 1,400 customers. Parts of northwestern New Jersey received 11 inches of snow, while the Pocono Mountains got 14 inches. The Massachusetts, Maine and New Jersey Turnpikes reduced speed limits on Friday because of whiteout conditions, and there were numerous reports of overturned cars. A Philadelphia commuter rail line shut down for an hour in the morning after a car skidded into a train in Lower Moreland, Pa., said Gary Fairfax, a spokesman for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. No one was hurt. Commuter service in Baltimore was also briefly halted because of the weather. ''The roads are abysmal at best,'' said Butch Roberts, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gray, Me. ''I just came in here at 2 p.m., and there were accidents everywhere. It's so greasy out there the plows can't keep up.'' In Chicago, a 6-year-old boy in a car was killed Thursday night when a Southwest Airlines jetliner skidded off a runway at Midway Airport, crashed through a fence, hit the car and stopped in the middle of an intersection. A Comair plane on its descent into Logan International Airport in Boston was struck by lightning Friday afternoon and made an emergency landing. None of the 32 passengers or 3 crew members on the flight were hurt. The plane, which suffered wing damage, was arriving from Baltimore. Logan Airport was later closed because of the weather, as were T. F. Green Airport in Providence and Hanscom Field in Bedford, Mass. The Federal Aviation Administration reported delays of at least an hour at Newark and LaGuardia airports, as well as Philadelphia and Midway. In Boston, Christine DeRosa, 36, a tax lawyer, spent a half-hour warming up and cleaning off her automobile, losing ''billable time'' at the office. Ms. DeRosa, who moved back to Boston from Washington after nine years away, said: ''Every year you think you're ready, but then the first snow comes, and it creates havoc on the roads, on the sidewalks, and you have to spend all that time cleaning off your car. Every year, Florida looks better and better.'' Lisa Dwyer, 28, of Brighton, Mass., said thick white flakes that fell as she waited for the bus were as much a part of life here as a roller-coaster Red Sox season. ''A true New Englander is always ready for snow,'' she said. Correction: December 17, 2005, Saturday An article last Saturday about a storm that left a trail of snow from the Great Lakes to New England misspelled a New Hampshire town where nearly 16 inches of snow fell. It was Dunbarton, not Durbinton."
"WITH temperatures dropping and snow falling in spots across North America recently, it can be hard to believe it's still fall. But even if winter is still a couple of weeks away, ski season has arrived. There's powder to be had already this year thanks to early snowstorms, and snowmaking machines are also helping to get the season started. This may seem a bit early for strapping on skis or a snowboard, but mountains across the United States and Canada are ready and waiting. ''Maybe the whole mountain's not open,'' Michael Berry, president of the National Ski Areas Association, said. ''But what is open is usually pretty good.'' Still, some places have it better than others. ''The most interesting thing we saw was a nice jump-start in the Pacific Northwest,'' Mr. Berry said. That's good news for resorts like Mount Hood Meadows (503-337-2222, www.skihood.com), about 70 miles east of Portland, Ore. The resort was able to open on Nov. 11 after a strong storm dropped more than 40 inches of snow. ''Our November this year is going to be a lot better than November last year, considering we didn't get open until around the 19th of December,'' said Dave Tragethon, marketing director at the resort. By the all-important Thanksgiving weekend, the resort had more than three quarters of its terrain open. Thanksgiving has become the target date for most resorts in North America to open. ''It's kind of the unofficial start of the ski season,'' Mr. Berry said. The day is the first of the season at Whistler Mountain (800-766-0449, www.whistlerblackcomb.com), in British Columbia, although Blackcomb Mountain, another part of the resort, opened on Nov. 5, three weeks earlier than usual, said Sara Aldridge, a spokeswoman for Whistler Blackcomb. Even though the weather has been inconsistent, late fall storms have also brought a good amount of snow to parts of the Northeast. In late October, temperatures dipped, and ski areas in places like Vermont were blanketed. Killington (800-734-9435, www.killington.com), for example, got 29 inches of snow before it opened on the last weekend of October. Using machines to add to the total, the resort had 40 trails open that weekend, said Tom Horrocks, its communications manager. But not long after, the weather warmed and the resort closed for almost three weeks, reopening on Nov. 19. By Thanksgiving, 50 trails -- about 33 percent of the terrain -- were open. ABOUT 180 miles southwest in the Catskill Mountains of New York, snowmaking is serious business. Hunter Mountain resort (800-486-8376, www.huntermtn.com), two and a half hours north of New York City, opened on Nov. 19. Without the benefit of high elevations that bring blankets of snow to places like Whistler, Hunter gets most of its snow, especially early in the season, from machines. That's also the case in western North Carolina, where the tallest peaks east of the Mississippi River don't always stay piled with powder at this time of year. Four of the seven ski areas there were open as of last weekend, said Kim Jochl, president of the North Carolina Ski Areas Association and marketing director at Sugar Mountain Resort (800-784-2768, www.skisugar.com), which opened on Nov. 18. ''We have the best technology in snowmaking and grooming, and we have to because we don't have Mother Nature always on our side like most of the western and northern resorts do,'' Ms. Jochl said of Sugar Mountain, which is the largest resort in the area. The season is also under way in Colorado, with areas across ski central starting their seasons recently. Aspen/Snowmass (800-308-6935, www.aspensnowmass.com) opened two of the four mountains there on Thanksgiving, with about 600 acres of terrain available. Soon after the holiday, a large storm jump-started the season, allowing the resort to open more terrain, said a spokeswoman, Kristin Rust. Farther west, the season is also ramping up. Snow has recently started arriving at Mammoth Mountain in California (800-626-6684, www.mammothmountain.com). ''It was a slow early season,'' Dana Vander Houwen, communications manager at Mammoth, said. The mountain opened on the planned date of Nov. 10 with much less snow than there was at that time last year, when Mammoth's second-snowiest season ever started in late October, Ms. Vander Houwen said. In Sun Valley, Idaho (800-786-8259, www.sunvalley.com), Nov. 23 was the start of this year's season, with eight runs on the area's two mountains open. A lot of snow fell in the second week of November, said Jack Sibbach, a spokesman for the resort, before the weather turned unseasonably warm. But the air cooled again recently, and the resort is continuing to open runs. And things are starting to whiten in Park City, Utah (800-222-7275, www.parkcitymountain.com), where only two runs were open when the season started on Nov. 23. ''What we wanted to do is we wanted to open the mountain and have great conditions on the runs we did have open instead of opening more runs with mediocre conditions,'' said Krista Parry, the resort's public relations manager. Just after the holiday, though, the snow came, and the resort planned to have 30 runs open by this weekend. SKI REPORT"
"It was just that kind of Sunday made for a couple of young brothers and their father, all wound up for winter. By the time the Buechner boys -- Dylan, 3, and Conor, 5 -- and their father, Terry, 36, had dug out their snow gear and arrived at Hillside Park in the Dumbo area of Brooklyn yesterday morning, there was just enough fresh snow on the ground to ride their plastic sled down the hill and gather up snowballs. The temperature hovered around 33 degrees, just cold enough to keep the snow from melting into sloppy slush. Dylan kept tugging at his gloves and pulling off his wool hat, complaining that his head itched. Conor could get out only one declaration -- ''I love throwing the snow!'' -- before he was compelled to go back to tossing whatever he could at his father. ''This might be the first snow they remember,'' said Mr. Buechner, holding his hand up to protect himself from Conor's missile. ''This is when the snow really matters, when it's fun.'' The first measurable snowfall of the season was more than a dusting, but not quite a storm. The National Weather Service said it began sometime after 2:30 a.m. yesterday, with 2.7 inches falling in Central Park, and stopped several hours later while much of the city slept. Early December snow, once a rarity, has come down on New York in four of the last five years. Weather experts warn not to think of the first snowfall as though it were a February groundhog, saying there is no way to predict what the rest of winter will bring. But forecasters expect a storm to creep into the New York region tonight, depositing as much as six inches of snow. Coming during the workweek, it will almost certainly mean snarled traffic and frustrated snow shovelers. Yesterday, though, the gleam of the first snow seemed to make everyone happy to see the piles of powder collecting on the street. ''It makes it feel like Christmas,'' said Cesar Mesa, 29, who works for a florist on Montague Street in Brooklyn and was decorating the poles there with pine boughs and red velvet bows. ''This is how we know it is winter here. And now less people are out and I can get more work done. It's perfect.'' In fact, the busiest intersection in Brooklyn Heights seemed to be back at Hillside Park, where half a dozen dogs were cavorting in the snow. Stella, a 4-month-old goldendoodle (a golden retriever and poodle mix), was being chased by the older dogs in her neighborhood. Her once-white fur looked like the once-white snow-- a muddled mix of brown, gray and all sorts of swampy shades in between. Stella's owner, Alex McGuire, 32, had a simple plan: washing her in the sink. Then, Ms. McGuire said, ''she'll look just as white as that first blanket.''"
"Eli Cabbad, known as Victor, looked out the window yesterday morning and allowed himself to hope again. In the way an undertaker relies on mortality, Mr. Cabbad counts on cruel weather in the wintertime. He is a hardware salesman. ''I have the snow shovel, I have the snow blower,'' he said, sadly. ''I have the ice melt, I have the ice scraper. They are all down in the basement because nobody needs them. Nobody is buying.'' And nobody did yesterday either. Winter, which has never really arrived in the city this winter, remained the reluctant bridegroom. A hard gray helmet of clouds that promised to warm the hearts of cold-weather lovers deposited no more than a trace of snow in the city, not even enough for meteorologists to bother to measure. The dusting lasted all of two hours in most of the city, the daytime temperatures did not even fall below freezing, and by afternoon the sun was shining down persistently, once again, from a lovely mackerel sky. ''This is winter?'' asked Mr. Cabbad, whose store is in Park Slope, Brooklyn. ''I need winter.'' Opinions among forecasters are divided as to whether he may see any before spring. But the statistics so far show that a blizzard would be required to help the winter of 2001-2002 right its reputation. So far, only 3 1/2 inches of snow have fallen in the five boroughs, and yesterday's snowfall is only the fourth of the season. If averages were being met, the city should have had 22 1/2 inches by now. (Last winter, there were 35 inches by the end of February.) Winter temperatures in the entire Northeast are higher. If warmer weather continues through today, climatologists at Cornell University say, the meteorological winter of 2001-2 will be the warmest on record for the region, with an average temperature above freezing for the first time in 107 years of official record-keeping. (Winter is defined meteorologically as Dec. 1 through the end of February.) The temperatures have made for some strange sights. At the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, for example, the February gold daffodil, so named because it generally blooms this month in the more temperate climates of England and Ireland, bloomed this month in Brooklyn, too. ''This is my 12th year here, and it's the first time I've seen it do that,'' said Judith Zuk, the garden's president. She thinks the daffodils' blooming is lovely but now worries that the cherry trees will shed their blossoms before the cherry-blossom celebration at the end of April. As far as Mr. Cabbad is concerned, there has been only one silver lining to all this warmth. ''Charcoal,'' he said. ''For the barbecues. They are buying it in the winter. It is a strange thing.''"
"The largest snowstorm in a decade iced the South today, causing hundreds of traffic accidents and 10 deaths. Business essentially closed for the day, and hundreds of airline flights were canceled, stranding 4,000 people overnight in Atlanta alone. Nearly 70,000 people lost electrical power. In South Carolina, where four to six inches of snow fell, Gov. Jim Hodges closed state offices and called out the National Guard. Even the Weather Channel, the Atlanta-based cable station that regularly sends reporters into the eyes of hurricanes, shut down for the day for all but a few essential employees. North of the Mason-Dixon line, a snowfall of less than a foot is just another winter day. The South, however, is a land with few snowplows, where driving on snow and ice is rarely practiced and road salt is in short supply. The shoulders of Interstates around the region were dotted with cars, and fatal accidents occurred in suburban Atlanta, South Carolina, North Carolina and Mississippi. Going to the airport meant risking hours of delay. Southern airports have far fewer de-icing machines than their Northern counterparts, and as a result, airlines at Hartsfield International Airport here, the nation's busiest, canceled two-thirds of their flights Wednesday night and this morning. The 4,000 people who were stranded scrambled for hotel rooms nearby, and hundreds slept in the terminal, which began to resemble a Red Cross emergency shelter. ''There was no room for us anywhere,'' said Julia Slovell, whose family of four from Asheville, N.C., camped out at a Delta gate Wednesday night, using backpacks for pillows. ''We feel like refugees.'' Even more frustrated were passengers whose flights did leave the gate, but then remained on the tarmac for five and six hours waiting for planes to be de-iced. Several passengers reported that only two de-icing machines seemed to be in use at Hartsfield. A spokesman for Delta Air Lines said the storm had hit earlier and harder than expected, leaving many planes without gates and stranding them on taxiways. ''We apologize to our customers whose travel plans were severely disrupted and we deeply regret the delays and discomfort they experienced,'' said the spokesman, Tom Slocum. Snow is hardly unheard of in the South, but this storm was unusual in that it moved north from the Gulf of Mexico, affecting the southern tier of the region more than the northern mountains. The Carolinas get similar snowstorms every few years, said Larry Vannozzi, a meteorologist with the Southern region of the National Weather Service, but for parts of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, the storm was the heaviest in many years. In Atlanta, for example, the heaviest 24-hour snowfall in recent years was 4.8 inches in 1992, according to Weather Service records. If this snowfall exceeds that -- which it might, once official records are confirmed -- it would be the heaviest since 1940. The storm clouds disappeared here by this afternoon, but snow continued to fall elsewhere, and forecasters said North Carolina could get more than a foot of snow by the end of the week. Light snow and freezing temperatures were even reported in the Florida panhandle. Many younger children had not seen this much snow in their lifetimes, and even those who wished the storm might have waited a few days until winter vacation was over nonetheless enjoyed the gift. ''I always wanted to build a snowman,'' said Noah Jenkins, 7, who was romping with friends in Centennial Olympic Park here. ''But it's a lot harder than I thought it would be.'' Many adults also needed refresher courses. Two tractor-trailers spun out of control on I-20 in western Georgia, and traffic quickly backed up for 20 miles. One man was fatally struck by a truck in Anson County, N.C., as he stopped to help a stranded motorist. Television stations repeatedly broadcast driving advice -- do not slam on your brakes, pump them -- but the lessons often went unheeded. ''I learned to drive in St. Louis, where people are a little more sophisticated on the ice,'' said Royal Marshall, the host of a local radio talk show. ''Of course, the Southerners would tell you they could handle the roads just fine if we hadn't all moved down here and clogged them up.'' On such days, it is assumed that employees will not come to work unless absolutely required. ''I would describe it as general panic, but I love it,'' said Mr. Marshall, whose show on Wednesday was filled with calls from Northerners ridiculing Southern driving habits. ''It's like in Spain during siesta, except it lasts all day,'' he said. ''Everything shuts down, and people just feel entitled to take the whole day off rather than risk their lives on the road.''"
"The first significant snowstorm of the season is expected to blanket New York City and the region's coastal areas, including Long Island, with four to six inches of snow today. Light snow is expected to start falling midday, and to increase and continue all night, according to the National Weather Service in Brookhaven, N.Y. The northern and western suburbs are expected to receive four to five inches, with the more distant northern and western suburbs, including Orange County in New York and Passaic County in New Jersey, receiving three or four. The New York City Department of Sanitation has loaded all 353 of its salt spreaders, which have plows, and expects to have 1,000 other vehicles with plows ready by noon, said Al Ferguson, a deputy chief. Three hundred more workers than usual will be on duty overnight, he said, with 1,400 more people than usual starting work at 7 a.m. Only a half inch of snow has fallen on the city so far this winter, when on average, seven or eight inches would have fallen, said Kevin Lipton, a meteorologist at the weather service. So far, the winter has also been exceptionally warm, with December the warmest on record for the New York region. ''January has been at least 4.5 degrees above normal,'' Mr. Lipton said. ''This may very well be among the top 10 or 15 warmest Januaries.'' As of last night, the approaching storm was dumping rain in the lower Mississippi valley, said Bob Stalker, also a meteorologist in Brookhaven. N.Y. Region"
"Americans have a long history as weather wimps. If it is our manifest destiny to live in a nation of climatic extremes, it is likewise our manifest duty to resist them. To city dwellers, even rain can be perceived as an affront, both personal and civic. More extreme events, like the seven feet of snow that afflicted long-suffering Buffalo over Christmas, and the ice and snow recently glazing unprepared climes like Atlanta and the Carolinas, evoke mingled feelings of dread and farce. Was it ever so? In the waning years of America's Gilded Age, East Coast urbanites reacted to the deadly Great Plains Blizzard of 1888 with condescending shrugs. What else would we expect in the Dakota wilderness, a place untamed by modern technology? The simple folk who lived in such places might be admirably brave, but they were also, as are Buffalonians today, at once absurd and pathetic. The developed East's sense of cultural superiority took a severe blow when, on March 12, 1888, a freak spring snowstorm buried New York City and environs in almost two feet of snow, whipped into mountains by fierce winds. The Blizzard of 1888 stopped the Empire City dead in its streetcar tracks and its crazy quilt of pole-mounted telephone and telegraph wires. In a town whose assumptions of status and class were turned topsy-turvy by nature, black men rescued white ladies from elevated rail lines and Italian immigrant snow shovelers became, if not actual heroes, at least wildly appreciated. Roscoe Conkling, a former United States senator, fell ill and died after being dug out of a deep drift. What good is technology, we seem to believe, if we cannot prevent natural forces from interfering with human purposes and disrupting the accustomed social order? The idea of acquiescing to, or even enjoying, blizzards, heat waves and all of our climate's other insults is at the very least un-American. So we overheat and overcool, greeting the first warm day of summer with a sweaty sense of grievance and the first frost with teeth-chattering complaints. After just a day or two confined by drifts or a driving ban in our TV/VCR/DVD/CD/Internet-equipped residences, we perceive ourselves as victims of a cabin fever as dire as what our ancestors of 1888 suffered in their Nebraska sod huts. Certainly, people are killed by weather, and it is also obvious that too many Americans live in houses, apartments or shacks devoid of electronics and sometimes also of heat, water and food. But the sense of outrage we direct at bad weather is surely an arrogant and ultimately useless response. After all, so many of the dangers of winter, in particular, are self-inflicted: shoveling driveways to get to obstructed highways; driving those icy roads to places that should be closed; showing up at the office, thanks to S.U.V.'s in rarely-used four-wheel drive mode, for the sake of being able to brag about our dedication and obstinacy. As Bernard Mergen points out in his recent book, ''Snow in America,'' widespread use of automobiles helped to turn snow from a welcome interlude into a public nuisance. But wait! Some recent developments hint that we may yet be able to strike a balance between seeking maximum control of our own daily lives and understanding the limits of human control. Perhaps our long romance with our own invincibility and our sense of the crucial importance of our every movement and desire are both, if not over, at least undergoing reconsideration. Just a few months ago, National Weather Service scientists announced that they had recalculated the wind chill factor, first developed in 1945 and mainly used in recent years by television weathermongers to exaggerate the dramatic possibilities of winter cold. The new chart is much less scary and does not seem to show up so often in TV weather forecasts. So far, the corresponding heat index of temperature in relation to humidity has not undergone a similar revision. A few days ago, a former Buffalonian who survived the region's endlessly bad winter of 1977 recalled in the Times letters column the ethereal and out-of-time beauty in a silenced, enshrouded town. And last week, The Associated Press reported, an Atlanta woman delightedly exchanged snowball volleys with her 4-year-old as snow and ice fell around them. We are awash in weather. Hundreds of newspapers have imitated USA Today's pioneering multicolor weather page introduced in 1982. The Weather Channel is compulsive viewing for many, and innumerable Web sites assure that weather is all around us, even indoors. Surrounded by our technologies and inventions, it may be true that we are ripe for humility, or at least a deeper appreciation of forces wilier and stronger than individual humans or nations can ever be. If that day is here, or on its way, we may not need a weatherman to know that the wind is going to blow, whether we like it or not. Marsha Ackermann teaches American history at Eastern Michigan University and is author of the forthcoming ''Cool Comfort: America's Romance with Air-Conditioning.''"
"The much-anticipated snowstorm, when it finally arrived, was more like a bad houseguest: it crept in at dusk and stayed just long enough to make a mess before departing. Despite ominous forecasts, the first major snowstorm in the New York metropolitan area flitted through on Sunday night and today with less bluster than expected. It left hardly a trace in New York City, and between 2 and 8 inches in suburbs to the north and west, including northern Westchester and Rockland Counties, and parts of Connecticut and New Jersey. The hardest-hit areas lay farther north in upstate New York, with the cities of Albany and Troy getting more than a foot of snow in less than 12 hours. By last night, Albany had reported 17 inches. The snowstorm forced dozens of schools around the region to cancel classes, while major roadways were snarled by traffic and slush and scattered power failures were reported in upstate New York. But, by and large, the consensus seemed to be that the storm had not lived up to its hype. ''This is it? This is everything?'' asked Joe Tucchi, 52, a White Plains computer consultant, as he looked at the soggy ground. ''I can't even find enough snow to make a snowball.'' In the Hartford area, where snow lightly covered trees and lawns, some schoolchildren said they had expected a snow day only to be disappointed this morning. ''I guess Buffalo used up all our snow,'' said Gabrielle Fasi, 10. Jeffrey Tongue, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the fast-moving storm started on the Gulf Coast on Sunday morning and reached New York around 5 p.m. He said the storm moved closer to the coast than expected, bringing in warmer air from the Atlantic and making snow less likely. Mr. Tongue added that there was still a chance of light snow on Friday. And what about another major snowstorm? ''Nothing really in sight,'' he said. ''I mean, it's going to snow sometime this year -- eventually.'' The snowstorm followed the warmest December on record for the New York region. According to the National Weather Service, the average temperature last month was 44 degrees, or about 7 degrees higher than normal. Snow can fall when the temperature drops into the 30's. After the unusually mild weather, many residents rushed out to stock up on shovels, salt and windshield scrapers this weekend. ''You keep hearing that winter's not here yet,'' said Jessie Alva, 37, an office clerk in Mount Kisco. ''Then it sneaks up on you when you're not looking.'' But others rejoiced that the snow had finally arrived, saying that it was better late than never. Bob Tesoro, owner of Ski Skate & Board in Tuckahoe, in Westchester, said his store was packed on Sunday after a slow December. ''For the same reason everyone runs and buys milk, that's what drives people in here,'' he said. ''It would be a lot better if there was snow out the door, but we still have seven weeks to go.''"
"The long-awaited first snow arrived yesterday, slowing highway traffic across the Northeast but falling short of the heavy accumulations that had been predicted. With snow continuing shortly before 11 p.m., the National Weather Service said 2 to 4 inches had fallen across the New York City metropolitan area, with a steady snowfall beginning to taper off in most areas and expected to end by midnight. That followed heavier buildups of snow and ice in Washington D.C., Philadelphia and elsewhere as the snow system moved quickly up the northeastern seaboard earlier yesterday from the Appalachian Mountains, causing dozens of vehicles to slide off roads. In New York City, the snow was met by a large assemblage of salt spreaders and plows that was apparently more than sufficient to meet the challenge. Kathy Dawkins, a spokeswoman for the Department of Sanitation, said 240 snow plows had been put to work in all the boroughs outside Manhattan, where accumulations exceeded two inches. But in Manhattan, where steam from underground utilities melted part of the snow away almost immediately, she said no plows had been dispatched, although major streets and avenues were being treated by salt spreaders. Airport officials reported short delays. Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New YOrk and New Jersey, said inbound and outbound flights were being delayed for an hour at Newark International Airport, but no delays were being reported at La Guardia or John Kennedy International Airports. The light snowfall came as a a disappointment to some, like Jennifer Wight, who took a No. 2 subway to make snowmen in Central Park around 5 p.m. At that time, there was not yet enough accumulation to form even the tiniest of snowballs. Ms. Wight, 18, had tried to make something of the snow before leaving home in Battery Park City, but the mixture of sleet and grime was nothing more than ''pretty yucky.'' ''I'm really impatient,'' she said. ''I just moved to New York from Hawaii and I've been wanting to get out of the house all day to play in snow.'' Meteorologists at the Brookhaven, N.Y., office of the National Weather Service had expected the metropolitan area to get up to seven inches of snow, but said that by 12:30 a.m., accumulations had reached 3 inches at Central Park. There were heavier accumulations of about four inches in parts of Long Island and Connecticut. Driving presented a challenge across the region, especially in areas where the storm hit earlier in the day. The northbound lanes of Interstate 75 were closed by a tractor-trailer accident near Fairmont, W.Va., and dozens of other accidents were reported elsewhere in the state. At Yeager Airport in Charleston, W.Va., flights to and from Cincinnati and flights to Atlanta were canceled. Before the snow hit New Jersey, residents rushed to buy salt, sand and shovels. Bob Daddona of Hamilton, N.J., walked out of a Home Depot with two snow shovels. ''But I'm not going to use them at the same time,'' he said."
"PLEASE, let it snow. Can't you feel it, every time you hear another dry, cold weather report, every time you step from a cab or a theater onto bare cement? The city desperately needs a real snow, the stuff that sticks, covers sidewalks, summons plows. Imagine having that soft white blanket laid over us, to calm and soothe and make our city beautiful and innocent again. Snow whispers winter, the season of slumber before a bright awakening in spring. It is a fabric that touches every home, drawing everyone together under its cover. Snow makes the city silent, absorbing sirens, machinery and the voices of men. Snow is a cushion under tires and under shoes. If it snowed it would touch the tips of cranes, the mouths of bulldozers, the street signs that read ''Vesey,'' the heel-worn asphalt on West Broadway, the curls of metal atop chain-link fences. It would touch the lawns along Beach 131st Street in the Rockaways. It would make white the roof of St. Vincent's Hospital and soften the tip of Ulysses Grant's sword on his statue in Union Square. Snow graces. Snow is innocent, new, sent down fresh. Snow is young. Let it be a heavy snow, a real deep snow, not the miserly sneeze of flakes we've seen so far. The kind of snow we can all trounce through together as equals and tell stories about at work the next day, the kind of snow that closes schools. There's nothing like that in the forecasts. Buffalo has received seven feet -- a bit much! -- and the Southeast has gotten more than its share. But as I write this, nothing yet for New York. If it snowed, children would make snowmen who would stand silently in our parks and conjure a simple tune from deepest memory onto the lips of passers-by: ''Frosty the Snowman was a jolly happy soul, with a corncob pipe and a button nose, and two eyes made out of coal.'' That damn old snowman with his magic silk hat. Remember when he waved goodbye, he said ''Don't you cry, I'll be back again some day.'' We need a visit, Frosty. Sure, in a couple days, a week, you'll melt into a pile of dirty slush that we'll step quickly over. We're New Yorkers. That's our way. But when your snowball stomach is stout and proud, we'll love you so much your coal eyes will shine like diamonds. Now is the time, Frosty. New York needs you. SOAPBOX Allen Salkin writes frequently for The New York Times. He lives on the Lower East Side. Correction: January 27, 2002, Sunday The Soapbox column last Sunday, about snow in New York, misidentified the historical figure whose statue in Union Square Park is holding a sword that would be softened by a blanket of snow. It is the Marquis de Lafayette, not Ulysses S. Grant."
"Lake Erie usually rides peacefully just beyond the low beaches and headlands at the western rim of the state of New York. But now and then -- most memorably in 1977 -- the lake seems to rise in a whirlwind of snow, obliterating Buffalo and the surrounding cities and towns, utterly silencing the countryside, except for the howling among the trees and the rooflines. In the 1977 blizzard, which began on Jan. 28, not all that much snow fell. But high winds seemed to carry the entire snow load of Lake Erie, which was frozen at the time, into the streets of Buffalo, creating a deep, natural impasto that didn't wear away until late spring. Fortunately for the city, the record-breaking storm that hit last week was completely different. In five days, nearly seven feet of snow fell, but what this storm possessed in volume it fortunately lacked in wind speed and wind chill. That has given snow-moving crews a chance to perform in just a few days the kind of plowing and road clearing it took weeks to accomplish in 1977. Nevertheless, all the usual huge-snowstorm consequences are in full play. Routine street-side operations, like garbage collection and parking and dog walking, remain temporarily suspended, some by order and some as a matter of fact. A few private snowplow operators, trying to even up their income streams after the November drought, have had to be slapped down for price gouging. And the sheer fact of seven feet of snow has given Buffalo residents, whom history has taught to loathe certain kinds of irony, a chance to reflect on their snow-less November, the first in anyone's memory. It looks to many people, well acquainted with the idea of retribution, as though last week's storm was just the evening out of a year-end weather pattern that has been particularly lumpy. When a snow like this begins to fall in Buffalo, you begin by thinking about basic preparations, checking the pantry and basement storeroom and the whereabouts of the family. The snow continues to fall, and some of the civic consequences cross your mind -- the meetings and services and games that will be canceled. And then the snow continues to fall, and after a day or two of watching it encroach on the ground-floor windowsills, watching it conquer the privet hedges and oppress the birdbaths and lawn ornaments, you simply stop thinking. The snow itself, falling and falling and whiting out the night, begins to look like the only single possible thought, a grand idea carried to sad excess."
"THERE was a time New Yorkers could handle a blizzard or anything else nature threw at us. We were tough. We were New Yorkers. In the 1960's, when massive snowstorms brought the city to a standstill, my dad was a city bus driver. and the overtime he earned during those storms allowed him to put a down payment on the house in Queens I grew up in. Even though some parts of the city didn't see a plow for a week, most New Yorkers took the storms in stride. But today, as we face a water shortage and, since March 26, a drought emergency, it is clear that we are not cut from the same hearty stock as our forebears. We are weather whiners. Maybe we've been spoiled by a string of relatively mild winters. Or maybe we're just never satisfied. In the heart of winter I hear: ''Al, when is it going to warm up?'' ''When will we see the sun?'' During the summer these same people ask, ''When is it going to cool off?'' ''How about a break in the heat?'' We've become a nation of complainers and New York is no exception. We had a virtually snow-free winter, and now we're paying for it with drought conditions. The last couple of weeks have brought needed showers. But people still come up to me and ask, ''When is it going to stop raining?'' Even though we know it's politically incorrect, the complaints are registered anyway. Luckily, nature pays no attention to our ranting and whining. Once a New York snowstorm meant at least a foot. Today, a few inches throw us into a panic. ''Oh, no! It's going to snow!'' ''Quick, stock up on groceries!'' What happened to us? Television is part of the problem. To boost ratings, local news management wants us weather people to play up the storm. ''Big Storm Coming. How Much? New Ice Age? End of the World as We Know It? Details at 11!'' When I was a local TV weatherman, I was as guilty as my brethren at the other New York stations. Every news director in town drools with anticipation if a big storm is headed this way in a ratings sweeps month. In the summer of 1985 the city faced a a drought emergency. Reservoirs were dry, lawns brown and swimming pools empty. I remember saying on the air at WNBC that we would need a hurricane bringing 10 or 15 inches of rain to alleviate the situation. Hurricane Gloria obliged us that September with close to 15 inches. End of drought, end of story. That could happen this year. But we shouldn't count on it, and we shouldn't whine either.

"IN Hollywood, snow is nearly always a snow job, a trick from the props department offered in the hope that we will deem it ''magic.'' In nature, snow is a crystalline marvel, a sign of winter and solitude; in movies, it is an atmosphere. Snow is a precipitation of the needy soul, or it is the cereal of sentimentality. But on occasion, the corn can make for rapture. In June and July of 1946, at the RKO ranch at Encino, they made the snowscapes for ''It's a Wonderful Life.'' RKO had acreage there for major exteriors, and that's where they built Bedford Falls, the all-American town where the story takes place. The snow was needed for the critical dark night of the soul when George Bailey comes so close to suicide at the thought of the family bank failing. But he is accosted by an angel, who dissuades him by revealing what might become of Bedford Falls without its George Bailey. George sees the light, and he runs home in a snowfall, happy again, calling out ''Merry Christmas'' to all. The bank survives. The family endures. Life is still wonderful. Christmas is the shawl of snow drawn up as a comforter. ''It's a Wonderful Life'' is a classic, which means it's a clich√© or a chestnut that still surprises you any year you return to it. But beyond its virtues as a movie, it is distinguished for another reason: it brought a revolution in movie snow. For decades, ''snow'' on screen had been an odd amalgam of shaved gypsum and white-coated cornflakes. Now a change occurred. Maybe it was because Frank Capra's vision called for the whole of Bedford Falls beneath the snow. Maybe he wanted to avoid the crackling sound of the cornflakes. Maybe it was also that Capra -- educated as an engineer -- knew to take advantage of technologies developed during the war. The studio's special effects man, Russell Sherman, used foamite -- the material from fire extinguishers -- mixed with sugar and water. He applied it by high-pressure hoses and used 50 tons of it. This was an early version of the artificial snow now used by ski slopes. In the bright summer light, with the temperature at 90, a winter of the spirit was laid down at Encino. I daresay the laborers were sweating to make the snow look right -- with car tracks, footprints and those small drifts blown against trees or walls. Well, it works on film -- always has -- so you feel as happy as George that he has come through. My other favorite Christmas movie is ''Meet Me in St Louis'' (1944). Here, after Judy Garland has sung the fragile ''Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,'' the child Tootie (Margaret O'Brien) rushes down to the garden and smashes her own snowmen. (So often Christmas turns out to be a passage of turmoil, frustration and even grief for kids.) When he witnesses that, Tootie's father knows his promotion to New York won't happen. The family will stay in St. Louis, as if it were Bedford Falls. The snow used for St. Louis must be the old-fashioned kind, looking a little blue and amber in the Technicolor night. It's not real snow, which can be so hard to photograph yet is ineffably mysterious: witness the landscapes brought back from Captain Scott's fatal expedition to the South Pole or the astonishing intimacy of stretched space and sound in Michael Winterbottom's film ''The Claim'' from last year. I'm a sucker for snow scenes. I think of the tiny cabin in a vast CinemaScope of snow at the end of Truffaut's ''Shoot the Piano Player''; the snow that falls on Robert Altman's McCabe and the three men he has killed in ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller''; and ''Track of the Cat,'' the William Wellman movie in which Robert Mitchum is unhinged by the prospect of a cougar treading softly in the snowy wilderness. And ''Citizen Kane.'' And ''Bambi.'' Iknow, those last two sound like opposite extremes of early-40's cinema. Yet I wonder. In ''Citizen Kane,'' the hero, and the mind telling the story, are fixed on the brightness of a small house in a snow globe, and by its reference to a Colorado childhood so rudely ended when the boy was sent away to grow up as a rich young man. He has never understood why he had to lose his mother. That is the old-fashioned snow, for sure, with bits of it, like sequins, already attached to the shawl Agnes Moorehead will put on as she goes out into the open. And there is falling snow, but also mounting snow -- a shifting radiance -- like a tomb on the fateful sled. If this page were a screen, I could cut to a similar image, and the same inward falling, in a scene from ''Bambi,'' made a year later -- the scene where, after his mother's death, Bambi begins to develop a relationship with his father. There is something profound in the moment, about loss and growing up, that is in the animated snow -- like tears, like the patter of time; I believe the makers of ''Bambi'' had seen and felt ''Kane.'' Maybe some had even read the James Joyce story ''The Dead,'' where snowfall is a metaphor for grief, burial and renewal: ''His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.'' Anything else? Just this. In ''The Two Jakes,'' as Robert Towne had written it and was going to direct it in 1985, there is a scene that never made it to the film that Jack Nicholson ultimately directed. His character from ''Chinatown,'' Jake Gittes, makes his farewells with the woman who is Faye Dunaway's character's sister and daughter in the earlier film. She is leaving L.A. but says she'll be back. When? asks Gittes. ''First snow on the ground,'' she says. Gittes replies sourly, ''The next time will probably be the first time,'' but then the scene dissolves to snow falling, and the Los Angeles Times headline -- from 1947, I think -- when that rarity happened, and this stage note: ''The headline dissolves into the streets of L.A. from Cahuenga to La Brea. From Mulholland to City Hall, filled with falling snow, and occasional pedestrians filled with joy at finding themselves in it, and occasionally finding each other.'' You can see that, can't you? Not every snow scene has to be filmed. HOLIDAY MOVIES"
"To find the Aladdin's Cave of modern glaciology, follow these simple directions: Fly to Bodo, in the Arctic Circle. Drive three hours south to an empty jetty and wait for the boatman. Cross the fjord, walk a mile on a gravel road toward the glacier, which looks like a huge cracked dragon's tongue of cornflower-blue ice. Make a brutal climb 1,800 feet up the mountain, sometimes sinking up to your waist in wet snow, sometimes climbing hand over hand on ropes stretched down slopes polished slick by the glacier. (You can use a helicopter in good weather, but that is expensive.) Enter a hole in the mountain resembling a sewer pipe. Don a hard hat, miner's light and rubber boots, and walk a mile as the tunnel slowly widens until it is big enough for a truck and is lighted by dim electric bulbs. Pass through a vast cement wall that in summer holds back a subterranean torrent. Find and climb the 79 wood steps that lead up through the tunnel roof. You are now at the bottom of the glacier. There are 700 feet of ice above you, and it all seems to be dripping down your neck. Fumble your way up 15 feet of slippery rock, gripping the ice walls for balance. At the top is a flat spot inside a shimmering wonderland. Long blades of ice -- some glowing white in the work lamp, some filthy with gray glacial sediment -- are coming at you from every direction. They are literally coming at you. This cave, just big enough for 10 people to stand in, did not exist two days before, and it will not exist in two more. It was carved out with a warm-water jet, and the ice, flowing like toothpaste at these depths, began pressing back in as soon as it was shut off. There is nothing quite like this back in Iowa, where Dr. Neal R. Iverson usually practices glaciology. There it is mostly theoretical, though he has a model made of two rotating aluminum plates with glacial sediments between them, which he describes as ''rotating a bagel and seeing the cream cheese shear.'' Here he has the real thing -- ice meeting rock under millions of tons of pressure. Like a vast snail, a glacier rides on a slurry of sediment and water, and Dr. Iverson's team is studying why it can race past at 150 feet a day or slow down to nearly zero. One preliminary discovery the team made this year is that the friction between the sediment and the rock face is more than 20 times as great as mathematical models had predicted. No one has ever been sure why a glacier does not race down a mountain valley like an ice cube on a sheet of glass. Recent thinking has been that bumps in the bedrock hold it back. But the team's data suggest that simple friction may apply the brakes, as if the ice cube has a sandpaper bottom. ''This is the only lab in the world like this,'' Erik Roland, manager of the glaciers and snow section for the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, said. The directorate, Norway's state power company, built and maintains it for scientists, with underground bedrooms for eight, telephones, a kitchen, a laboratory with a big freezer, drilling equipment and a huge hot-water spray machine. Traveling to glaciers is relatively easy. Tunneling beneath them is difficult. Scientists in Greenland take ice cores down to 10,000 feet, but cannot follow their drill bits down. In Antarctica, tunnels have been cut with six-foot chain saws, but that is mere nibbling at the glacial edge. In past decades, there have been smaller temporary laboratories in natural pockets under the Argenti√®re Glacier in France and in a power tunnel under the Bondhusbrea Glacier in Norway. But they are closed. A short tunnel lies under a glacier in Tianshan, China, but it is a ''cold glacier'' -- frozen to its bed. So motion studies like those by Dr. Iverson's team are impossible. The Svartisen is a ''temperate glacier,'' meaning that its ice is right at the melting point, zero degrees Celsius. One thing the experts have not yet worked out is why, even near the bottom, it is full of water pockets, like Champagne bubbles, except that when these pop, surprised scientists receive ice water showers. On sunny days, millions of gallons of snowmelt filter down through the glacier, raising the water pressure where it meets the rock. That melt is the reason the power company built 60 miles of tunnels under the edge of the Svartisen. The tunnels carry the melt to hydroelectric turbines. The hotter the weather, the more water flows -- the reverse of the normal situation for most hydroelectric plants, which cut back in hot summers for fear of drought. Nearly alone among the world's glaciers, Norway's are increasing in size. For unknown reasons, shifting global weather patterns have brought more precipitation to the fjord-dented coastline. Glaciers like Svartisen can receive 20 or more feet of new snow a season, thousands of tons bearing down on the center. ''That's good for us,'' said Dr. Denis Cohen, a Yale glaciologist who collaborates with Dr. Iverson's team. ''Gets the glacier moving.'' That gives the team a chance to record sliding speeds, friction, viscosity under various water pressures, porosity of the sediments and such. Unusual ice crystals form under such pressures. In the right light, hexagons bigger than baseballs can be spotted in the cave's walls. A few years ago, Dr. Cohen carried home a sizable block of the subglacier, arranging for dry ice along the way and assuring airline personnel that his big smoking suitcase was harmless. The work can be backbreaking. In the rock floor, the scientists chiseled out a sort of bathtub and filled it with $4,000 worth of instruments that measure water pressure, load, tilt and strain. The gear has to be buried by hand under 5,000 pounds of glacial till, the fine grit created by ice grinding over rock. Dr. Iverson's nine-member team carried the till up the 79 steps and the ice slope in bucket relays. One debate -- over the brown goat cheese and salmon caviar in tubes that Norwegians consider lunch meat -- was over who would shovel, who would stoop through the narrow doorway and whose boots were too worn to get up the slope. A stake through the till marks each buried instrument, and the last act by a scientist before leaving the shrinking cave is to pull those stakes. One departs the ice lab with the unmistakable sense that Dracula has been awakened -- but is going to be pretty shocked to discover just how cold his tomb is. The ice will close in, start pressing down on the ''bathtub'' and then flow across it. Just finding a good spot for a red plastic ball the scientists wanted the glacier to ''pick up'' took an hour of chiseling out a hole with an electric hammer. The ball was attached by wire to a data recorder and was to act as a speedometer as the glacier moved away. But they were uncomplaining. Glaciologists consider themselves hardier than, say, microbiologists. ''Most of us like being outdoors,'' said Dr. Miriam Jackson, a glaciologist for the Norwegian power company who works with Dr. Iverson's team. ''You have more than your number of keen skiers and keen mountaineers.'' But, she added, the discipline does have its desk jockeys who model glaciers on computers and others who collect satellite photos. ''They don't get out very much,'' she said with a trace of pity. Glaciologists have another reason to be pleased with themselves. In the last few years, fear of global warming has made theirs a much hotter field. ''Before, if you studied ice mechanics,'' Dr. Jackson said, ''it was regarded as pretty useless. Now, if you can relate it to climate change, people regard it as relevant and you get the funding.'' Some financing comes from the Army, the United States Geological Survey and NASA. But the National Science Foundation underwrites the bulk of the pure science work. Much of that effort is going into digging ice cores, which give remarkably accurate data about weather changes eons ago. ''You get amazing time resolution,'' Dr. Iverson said. ''You can tell things like the climate changed by 8 degrees for three years 11,000 years ago.'' Testing the slipperiness of ice is a bit more esoteric. But, as Dr. Iverson pointed out, there are many scientists and satellites keeping an eye on the vast Antarctic ice shelves and their potential to raise ocean levels. ''If Ice Sheet B started moving at 10 times its rate,'' he said, ''there would be a big cry for finding out what goes on at the bottom of ice sheets.'' Dr. Iverson is a romantic about glaciers, perhaps not surprising because his studies in Iowa work with all that is left -- their scuffed footprints. He sees them not as passive snowmen whose smiles droop wanly as global warming beats down on them, but as major actors on the world weather stage, scenery chewers full of pent-up energy. As an example, he cites the Laurentide Ice Sheet, a fast mover that once barnstormed the American Midwest and then retreated. ''About 14,000 years ago, it changed the drainage of the center of America,'' he said. ''Instead of draining to the North Atlantic, it started flowing to the Gulf of Mexico. I'm sure that had a huge effect on global heat in the atmosphere. ''So glaciers don't just respond to climate change, they trigger it. That idea wouldn't have been accepted 20 years ago.''"
"At midmorning, with the perennial snow on the volcano of Mount Hood softening underfoot in the sun's glare, Janet Quackenbush looked up toward the summit and saw the chain reaction. A party of four slipped just short of a pass called the Pearly Gates, picked up speed, knocked down two other groups, and were soon swallowed by the big blue opening in the mountain's glacial ice. The accident killed three, most likely on impact, and then led to another accident, as an air reserve rescue helicopter went down, tumbling and rolling a thousand feet, though all crew members survived, including one who was crushed beneath the chopper. But as haunted as Ms. Quackenbush was by witnessing the latest in a string of alpine accidents during the traffic-jam season of Northwest climbing, she was also upset that her own summit attempt was canceled today while rescuers tried to get the last body from the crevasse. Though she had never scaled a serious mountain before, she came from her home in Show Low, Ariz., with the sole intention of climbing Oregon's highest peak today. The deaths, here and earlier in the week on Mount Rainier, where three people died after a ferocious storm on the 14,411-foot peak, did nothing to deter her. ''I'm very sad at what happened, but it doesn't make me not want to climb,'' said Ms. Quackenbush, who is 51. ''Once you get up there, it's the view, and the rush, and the feeling of accomplishment.'' Nor are the accidents likely to deter other climbers of Mounts Hood and Rainier, a number that has nearly doubled to about 10,000 annually for each mountain in the last 15 years, officials say. At this time of year on the basic routes, people bunch up as they near the summits of the Northwest's signature mountains. The climbers who started Thursday's accidents were a few hundred feet from the top when they slipped and snagged two roped parties behind them. ''Sometimes it's so crowded you can look up and just see the line like ants going up a hill,'' said Mary Ellen Fitzgerald, a wilderness ranger with the Forest Service. Rescuers who today removed the last of the bodies from the icy tomb of Mount Hood said they had few answers to what caused the second-worst accident in the mountain's history. They did say the climbers were still ascending at a time, about 9 a.m., when the snow is soft, and could lead to slippage, and most climbers are well on their way down. No experience or special permits are required to climb Mount Hood, which rises nearly from sea level to 11,240 feet, other than a simple wilderness entry registration card. The climb looks easy, and most people do it in a long day that begins at midnight, at the 6,000-foot-high lodge, and then a trek of 3.6 miles to a view of a hundred miles on clear days. Officials credited the work of the Air Force Reserve helicopter pilots with saving lives. As the chopper began to shudder, the pilots backed it away from the rescue site, and a crew member cut a cable that had been hoisting an injured climber. Both actions probably kept others from dying, rescue officials said. ''If it wasn't for the heroic work of the pilots, you probably would have had a lot more casualties,'' said Sgt. Nick Watt of the Clackamas County sheriff's office. He did not know if the climbers followed the rules of alpine safety for climbing on glaciers. Climbers are supposed to be roped, to have crampons on their feet, and an ice ax in hand, all intended to stop a slide into a crevasse. But some people never rope up, and others climb with no idea that the mountain can turn Himalayan at a moment's notice, guides say. Hood has claimed 130 lives, and none of the deaths reveal a consistent enough pattern to prompt changes in safety requirements, Forest Service officials say. ''This upper part of the mountain is a federal wilderness and what goes on up there is what we called unconfined recreation,'' Ms. Fitzgerald said. ''If we start saying what you can and can't do, it gets down to micromanaging people's freedom on public land.'' The result of a century of hands-off managing is that Mount Hood, like Rainier, ends up being somewhat of a laissez-faire zone for lovers of high altitude. Last week a snowboarder, Juancarlos Munoz, 30, was trying to glide from the summit. He was not roped, and the ridge lines were icy. He fell 2,500 feet to his death. The main investigators of Thursday's accident, from the Clackamas County sheriff's office, said they would try to find out the cause of the deaths, but would not investigate whether mistakes had been made or if inexperience might have been a a factor. ''That's not something we usually do,'' Sergeant Watt said. Even with four deaths from two separate accidents in the last 10 days, he said there would be no larger questioning beyond routine medical examiner queries. The Rainier accident earlier in the week involved experienced climbers who were trying to make the summit via Liberty Ridge, one of the mountain's most challenging routes. A snowstorm with gusts of 60 miles an hour forced them into their tents, which collapsed. They dug snow caves, and later died stumbling down the mountain in whiteout conditions. ''We leave it up to people climbing the mountain to know what they're doing,'' said Jeff Jaqua, a Forest Service rescue coordinator. ''You register to climb, then you're on your own. This is public land, and this is what the public wants.'' The peaks attract the powerful, the glamour set, and day visitors in little more than tennis shoes. Former Vice President Al Gore climbed Mount Rainier a few years ago, and was caught in a vicious summer storm. ''It looks like it might be easy,'' he said, ''but it's one of the hardest things I ever did.'' Some officials have said that regulation will be necessary, at least to limit the number of people on certain routes of dangerous peaks like Rainier and Hood. Other high peaks limit climbing permits during the peak season. But rangers here said that as interest in climbing has risen, so has awareness of the risks. That may be one reason that the number of deaths has remained fairly steady as the number of climbers has doubled. The main climbing season on Mount Hood begins in mid- to late May and continues through mid-July. May and early June can be a treacherous time. In Mount Hood's worst accident, seven students and two faculty members from the Oregon Episcopal School died after a fall in May 1986. A former teacher at the same school fell off the summit in June 2000, two people fell to their deaths in May 1999 and a climber died in an avalanche in May 1999. Climbing guides like Peter Keane of Bend, Ore., said the biggest problem on Mount Hood was a lack of experience. ''Nowadays,'' he said, ''there are a lot of people climbing the mountain who really don't know what they're doing. There are more people on the mountain than I'd like to see, for sure.''"
"I love the A.F.C. East. This is a conference of Bills and Jets, Dolphins and Patriots, who have been slugging it out since the 1960's. The Bills and the Dolphins have been doing this dance since 1966. The American Football Conference East stretches from Miami's heat to the freezing cold in Buffalo, where crowds cheer snow squalls. ''That's Buffalo Bill weather,'' Coach Gregg Williams said. ''We like the weather when it's like that.'' Most of the talk after Buffalo's thrilling 38-21 victory over Miami yesterday was about the weather -- the swirling snow that came and went and finally came with a fury in the third quarter. Miami left 80-degree weather on Saturday for Buffalo's 25 degrees at kickoff. Jamie Nails, a Miami offensive lineman who played in Buffalo for four seasons, said the weather was mostly in the mind. ''When Buffalo comes to Miami, it feels like 100 degrees to them and 70 to us,'' he said. ''When we come up here, it feels 20 below to us, and 30 to them. It's all in the mind.'' Ricky Williams, the Dolphins' star running back, admitted that the cold was in his head. Born in San Diego, Williams said that he had been psyching himself up for Buffalo -- the city, not the team -- since the beginning of the week. ''I'd check on my phone to see the forecasts up here and look on my computer every chance I had,'' Williams said. ''I was a little nervous about it.'' After Williams's first run of the afternoon went for a 45-yard touchdown, everything, in a manner of speaking, was cool. He ran 27 times for a career-best 228 yards. When the snow squalls finally came, Williams admitted that the little kid in him rejoiced. ''I never saw snow until I was a teenager,'' he said. ''I always watched games played in these kind of conditions and thought it would be a lot of fun to play in a game like this. You don't realize how cold it is until you get out in it.'' But this game was lost by the Dolphins long before the snow squalls came and turned the game as topsy-turvy as the A.F.C. East race. Long before the snow, Miami defenders dropped at least four probable interceptions: Zach Thomas, Jamar Fletcher, Patrick Surtain and Sam Madison dropped one each. The Dolphins lost their composure when the field was bone dry. Leading by 14-3, the Dolphins had Buffalo first-and-20 in Bills territory. Surtain slapped Eric Moulds on the helmet after a catch and, in turn, was slapped with a 15-yard penalty. There was a face-mask penalty, a pass interference call and then Drew Bledsoe scored on the 10th play of the drive. The biggest blunder of the afternoon -- and, who knows, possibly of the season -- was made by Dolphins Coach Dave Wannstedt. With his team leading by 14-10 and the first half winding down, Miami was faced with fourth-and-4 on the Buffalo 36-yard line. Wannstedt elected to go for a first down. ''All you got to do is see that score,'' he said in rationalization. ''When you're on the road, you're going to have to score points against Buffalo. Drew is going to score points. You could just feel it out there, and we're at the 36-yard line. They have no timeouts. You got to try to get some points.'' What unfolded next had to put the Jets and the Patriots in stitches. This was the absolute worst-case scenario. Ray Lucas, the Miami quarterback, trying to make up for a wretched game against Buffalo on Oct. 20, went back to pass. Instead of getting rid of the ball, Lucas tried to make something happen. He pumped, brought the ball down. Then wham. Sack, fumble. Four plays later, Bledsoe hit Peerless Price with a touchdown pass. Buffalo led by 17-14 at intermission. ''Those could have been momentum changers,'' said Madison, the Dolphins cornerback. ''It really hurts because we had this wrapped up. They didn't quit. They played all four quarters and we didn't.'' Lucas started this game on fire -- he handed off to Williams for Miami's first touchdown and threw a 1-yard pass for the Dolphins' second touchdown. Then he made that fumble just before intermission. With 11:35 left in the third quarter, Lucas -- making his sixth straight start in place of the injured Jay Fiedler -- was knocked out of the game and maybe the season by Keith Newman, the Bills linebacker, injuring a nerve in his neck. But the Dolphins survived for a while. Williams scored on a 55-yard run, the longest of his career, and Miami led by 21-17. I found myself thinking that maybe the Dolphins are finally crumble proof. Before I could complete the thought, Bledsoe hit Price with a 73-yard touchdown pass, the longest in Price's career. A series later, after Buffalo recovered a fumble, Bledsoe hit Moulds with a 57-yard strike that slid off Madison's fingertips and ricocheted into Moulds's outstretched hands. Then came the bizarre part. After the game the Dolphins, despite losing, were talking trash. ''They were saying things like: 'That's O.K., y'all ain't making the playoffs, 'y'all ain't going nowhere,' '' Price said. ''All I know is that we're right back in the race in the A.F.C. East.'' Jets and Dolphins and Bills are celebrating Miami's blustery misfortune, but Madison said the trip may yet serve a purpose. ''We played well in the type of conditions we were in being that we're from 80-degree weather,'' he said. ''We have to learn to make plays in these kinds of conditions. It'll help us later on down the road because we have a late game at the end of the season in New England and there may be these kind of conditions. We'll be prepared for it.'' Sounds good, but I wouldn't count on it. Sports of The Times"
"CraigTurgeon, a 19-year-old freshman at the University of Southern Maine in Portland, was losing his patience last month as rain drenched his early season skiing plans. But fortunately for Mr. Turgeon, who typically skis more than 30 days a year at the Sunday River resort in Newry, Me., he had the Web. Like many large resorts, Sunday River has a Web site that includes a good range of information on opening dates, lift ticket prices and a daily ski report with updated photos of the trails. More important for Mr. Turgeon, www.sundayriver.com users may also sign up for e-mail newsletters, including a daily snow report. Within a day of getting the first favorable snow report, Mr. Turgeon hit the slopes. ''It's wicked useful, because the site will say how much of a base there is, or what the top three inches are like,'' he said. ''They won't come out and say it's slush, but it'll generally give you a good idea of what the mountain's about.'' The Internet's ability to deliver information instantly to people within driving distance of a resort makes it a critical tool for skiers and snowboarders itching to hit the trails on a moment's notice. But it is equally well suited for those doing long-range planning, with a burgeoning list of sites taking varied approaches to serving ski travelers. The resorts' own Web sites are decent places to start for those who know where they are going. But too often, these sites engage in boosterism; and since these are creations of ski companies, not travel companies, they sometimes ignore considerations like lodging, dining and activities near the mountain, not to mention airline booking. The task, then, becomes how to find a travel site that's savvy enough about skiing to provide good mountain information, or a ski site that's smart enough about travel to be helpful for those on the road. While both these categories contain a few good sites -- and no site qualifies as excellent -- the ski-specific sites are a good place to begin. Perhaps no site is more qualified to dispense information about specific resorts than myskitrip.com, which is run by AOL Time Warner's Time4 Media, the same company that publishes Freeze, Skiing and Ski magazines. Since those publications serve snow enthusiasts ranging from Generation Y shredders to black diamond Baby Boomers, myskitrip.com could presumably speak with authority and objectivity about the 500 domestic and foreign resorts it lists. Why it often chooses not to is a mystery. According to Ken Payne, the general manager of Time4 Media's ski magazines and myskitrip.com, the company relies on resorts to update information about trails and snowfall. But the site also leaves it to the resorts to provide general descriptions of their ski areas -- an open invitation for stale brochurespeak. (''Arapahoe Basin offers skiers exciting and challenging terrain for the entire family,'' begins one such yawner.) Still, myskitrip shows a creative spark when it includes reviews gleaned from one of the company's magazines. A recent review of the Snowbird resort in Utah, for instance, vividly described the mountain's front and back sides and characterized the trails in ways no brochure would: ''Steep, deep and will wear you out in a hurry.'' (The site archive has more reviews like this, and skimag.com, a sister Web site, offers still more in-depth reviews and a searchable archive from the magazine.) In terms of providing travel specific information like tips on lodging, dining and such, myskitrip.com gets barely passing grades. It tells users whether resort lodging is available, then points them to a short list of vacation rental providers and other companies that advertise on the site. It also offers prepackaged ski vacations from Moguls Mountain Travel, a Boulder, Colo., travel agency. Thanks largely to the dot-com boom a few years back, there are even more ambitious sites available. Ski portals, the online clearinghouses for information and products, are no longer as abundant as they were when dot-com entrepreneurs sought to build portal sites for everything from ferret lovers to B-movie fans, but a few still exist. One is skicentral.com, which bills itself as a specialty search engine for the downhill crowd. Skicentral includes listings of more than 8,000 sites that are related -- sometimes quite indirectly -- to skiing and ski resorts. Because so many ski-related travel sites offer packages of information about certain ski areas, skicentral is a good resource for do-it-yourself travel researchers who are looking for more off-beat ideas for their trip. You can find information on a particular ski venue by clicking on the ''resorts and travel'' link near the top of the homepage. That will frequently yield a compendium of links, including an ''all about'' link for resorts. Those links often lead to an array of information, including links to the resort's site, restaurants, lodging and sometimes random-sounding sites that are ostensibly related to the resort -- for instance, a link to an employment Web site appears within the Arapahoe Basin section, while a link to a software site appears near the Aspen section. Users can also find information not included by some other ski-travel sites, like skicentral's directories of skiing organizations for the disabled in the Aspen area. For ski buffs willing to settle for less variety in exchange for more travel services, Expedia, Travelocity and Orbitz have each rolled out entire sections devoted to skiers. Travelocity has the most comprehensive of the three, with its ''Skiing and Snowboarding'' section, found through the link in the ''What's Hot'' list on the right side of the home page. That section includes more than 600 North American resort descriptions, in the ''Mountain Resort Guide'' under ''Ski Resources.'' Travelocity also includes a useful ''Resort Finder,'' where users can look for resorts by attribute, like the region or size. Like myskitrip.com, Orbitz relies on Moguls Mountain Travel for part of its content, listed under ''See Deals For'' on the top right of the home page. In this case, Moguls provides an exhaustive listing of resorts both in and outside of North America. Expedia, meanwhile, offers information on 41 resorts in North America under its ''Special Interests'' section, but it is more limited than that on other Web sites. But users can book airline tickets and hotel accommodations and create ski vacation packages without having to click away from a resort's description page. Expedia also tips its hat to cross-country skiers with short sections under ''Activities, Lessons and Child Care'' for each resort. Serious cross-country skiers will find it's worth a trip to Trailsource.com, which caters to backcountry enthusiasts. By clicking on the skier on Trailsource's home page, users are taken to a page with a world map that leads to more than 600 cross-country trails in 30 countries. Backcountry skiers with more extreme tastes may want to stop in at one last Web site before they travel: The CyberSpace Avalanche Center (www.csac.org). The Avalanche Center lacks a polished presentation and, at times, an intuitive navigation scheme, but by clicking to different states and mountains, users can see areas of high avalanche probability, and read about factors that contribute to avalanche conditions. The site also provides an opportunity to receive e-mail avalanche alerts. Users may not greet such missives with the enthusiasm they reserve for reports of snow from their favorite resorts, but such a potentially life-saving feature might still be, as Mr. Turgeon might say, ''wicked useful.''

"In some parts of the city and suburbs yesterday the lights were still out. In other places, trees toppled by snow blocked plows and snarled traffic. Trains ran 10 or so minutes behind schedule. Across a region contending with the results of a too-white Christmas, people awoke to a windy, slushy mess. Pedestrians struggled on sidewalks slick as glaciers. Cars plied streets and highways that were mostly cleared of snow but icy in spots. From Connecticut to Long Island, from Westchester to Brooklyn, people dug out of the snow left behind by a ferocious northeaster as best they could. At Newark Liberty International Airport, it took 500 tons of sand, an equal amount of salt and 80,000 gallons of de-icing liquid to get the runways cleared and airplanes set to go. In West Hempstead, N.Y., where more than 11 inches of snow fell, officials were still digging 16 hours after the snow stopped falling. In Connecticut, where some areas got a foot of snow, some 4,600 homes were still without power yesterday, though 11,000 others had had power restored. The ferocity of the storm caught many local officials off guard. ''It was a lot rougher than we expected,'' said Richard Bergstresser, first selectman in Greenwich, Conn., where as much as 12 inches of snow fell. ''We had large numbers of trees down.'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said that plowing had gone well in New York City, where five inches of snow fell in Central Park on Wednesday. ''Last night, if you watched television, you saw lots of places in the area where the roads were impassable,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference at City Hall. ''But then when the television stations switched to their reporters in the five boroughs, it should not go unnoticed that the streets were being cleaned.'' He added playfully, ''I will also take full credit for being the first mayor in 31 years to deliver a white Christmas.'' (Actually, it's been 33 years, according to the weather purists, who insist on at least an inch of falling snow that sticks, no matter how much is already on the ground. By that standard, the city's last white Christmas was in 1969, when 2.1 inches fell.) John J. Doherty, the city's sanitation commissioner, did not give a firm figure for how much the removal of so much snow would cost the city, but he said that it typically costs $1 million per inch on the ground. The cost of digging out from this storm will likely be higher, because of the overtime pay for 2,000 employees who were called in to work a 12-hour shift on the holiday, Mr. Doherty said. Across the city, main streets were clear but some side streets remained clogged with snow, which melted in yesterday's sun then froze into slick patches of black ice after sundown. Leroy Comrie, a Queens councilman, said that plowing was spotty. ''Some areas in Rosedale didn't get plowed, off of Jamaica,'' he said, ''but overall most people did all right.'' Sidewalks were another matter yesterday. The east side of Central Park West was encrusted in ice and melting snow from 63rd Street to Columbus Circle. On the northwest corner of 71st Street and Broadway, a young man carrying three cups of coffee tried to help an elderly man with a cane navigate the slushy, icy corner. Even in Midtown Manhattan, the sidewalks were treacherous for much of the day. A Manhattan housekeeper who lives in Crown Heights said that her walk to the No. 3 train at Kingston Avenue was dangerous. ''The streets were plowed but the sidewalks -- nothing, pure ice,'' she said. She chose to walk in the street instead, as did many of her neighbors. When she got to her subway stop she was shocked to find the steps encased in ice. ''No salt to melt the ice. Unbelievable.'' Other subway riders reported similar problems. The Metro-North Railroad reported small delays, most of which were attributed to slow boarding by passengers on icy platforms. ''Obviously there was still snow and ice on the train platforms, despite our best efforts,'' said Dan Brucker, a spokesman for Metro-North. ''So people take their time.'' During most of the morning rush, there were 5- to 10-minute weather-related delays on westbound Long Island Rail Road trains that passed through the Jamaica station, said Sam Zambuto, a spokesman for the rail company. Some major highways were largely unaffected. In New Jersey, the state police reported an increase in fender-benders but no traffic deaths related to the snow, which reached 12 inches in Sussex County but only a fifth of an inch in Atlantic City (most of the southern part of the state recorded only rainfall). Highway traffic was lighter than usual yesterday, the police said. But in other places the roads were far more dangerous. An officer with the Highway Patrol in Nassau County was seriously injured when he was struck while setting up flares at the scene of an accident on the Long Island Expressway in Jericho, officials said. Trees toppled on roadways elsewhere, snarling traffic and halting plowing efforts. And James Johnson, Westchester County's superintendent of road maintenance, said that more than 30 trees had fallen along the Bronx River Parkway alone. ''It was a tough storm,'' he said. ''We had a tremendous amount of trees down from the weight of the snow. They snap. It made things very difficult.'' With temperatures above freezing and persistent sunshine yesterday, some of the snow began to melt. Today the temperatures will be in the mid- to high 30's, and it will continue to get warmer through the weekend, with an expected high in the low 40's on Saturday."
"Longtime residents of this city of legendary winters woke early this morning and found the world had somehow righted itself after several years of mild winter weather. The streets were blanketed in 21 inches of snow, the cars had turned to smooth hillocks, and the sidewalks were no more than a rumor beneath the thick, white cover. ''The cars were completely covered, not even the mirrors showing,'' said Walter Nickens, a 51-year-old dishwasher who lives downtown. ''You thought you were in the country somewhere. It was beautiful.'' Mr. Nickens started shoveling at 5 a.m. and was just finishing up at 3 p.m., leaning on his shovel and admiring the four cars he had carved out of the snow. Across the city and its surrounding counties, people spent the morning digging out and struggling to get to work on roads where, in many places, only one lane was open. On Christmas Day and through the night, a wicked northeaster that dropped 5 inches of snow on Manhattan -- and more than twice that in some New York City suburbs -- left a thick covering across much of central New York, the Catskills and the upper Hudson Valley. Walton, in Delaware County, received 33 inches, while 31 inches fell in Liberty, in Sullivan County. The largest snowfall was in Cherry Valley, an Otsego County town, where 39 inches fell. The people of the state capital took the storm in stride. Crews of teenagers and men gleefully took to the streets with show shovels to dig out cars for a few extra bucks. Children on Christmas vacation hit the hills with toboggans. With sidewalks impassable, people walked down the middle of slush-filled roads to the few stores that managed to open. Historians, politicians and other local sages said the storm reminded them of the great winters of the past. There has been a general feeling here in recent years that something had gone wrong with the weather. In the 1990's, several winters brought only sleet, rain and mud, which no one seemed to like. ''It seems to me like the winters I remember, more like them than in the last three or four years, when I was convinced global warming was on the rise and we would be swimming in December,'' said William Kennedy, the author who has immortalized Albany in his novels. Assemblyman John J. McEneny, Albany's representative and a local historian, said he started shoveling at midnight last night in hopes of putting a dent in the mountain of snow so he could free the cars in his driveway in the morning. Like many Albany residents, he said he did not mind the weather. His grandmother used to tell him of the great blizzard of March 1888, when 46.7 inches of snow fell on the city and they had to dig tunnels through the snow because it was impossible to move. All storms pale in his imagination to that one, he said. ''It is beautiful and it does force people to have their lives slow down,'' he said, ''and it's a great reminder that nature is bigger than all of us.'' No one knows precisely why the winter has started so early and come on so hard this year, but no one doubts this is going to be a hard, cold season. Never has so much snow fallen here in the month of December -- 32.6 inches, according to the National Weather Service. (For the record, Albany's worst winter ever straddled 1971 and 1972, when 112 inches fell.) Meteorologists, who do not have a sterling reputation as soothsayers around the capital, say the early winter has something to do with unusually warm air over Greenland, unusually cold air in the upper atmosphere of the North Atlantic, and warmer-than-normal temperatures in the Pacific around the Equator, the El Ni√±o phenomenon. Chris Johannesson, a meteorologist at Penn State University, said the combination of these trends has been causing winter weather in the Northeast for more than a month, but that is no guarantee the heavy snows will continue. ''It can easily swing back the other way,'' he said. Last night's storm forced state officials to take the unusual step of closing more than 140 miles of the Thruway from Syracuse to the Catskills for six hours because plow operators could not see more than a few feet in front of them. It reopened at midnight. In Delaware County, the authorities closed the roads from 3:30 p.m. yesterday to 8:30 this morning. Route 17 was also closed, and stranded motorists were forced to lodge overnight at a local school. Officials in Otsego, Herkimer and Schenectady counties took similar precautions late Christmas Day, closing roads to let plows through. There were very few reports of serious collisions or injuries in places where heavy snow fell, the state police said. ''If there is such a thing as a good time for a storm this is what happened yesterday, as traffic volume was down because of the holidays,'' said Sgt. Glenn Miner, a spokesman for the state police. The morning trip to work was difficult, however, and those who made it often wondered why they had, since so few people were about. John Woodward, the Schenectady County clerk, got up at 3:15 in the morning to dig his car out at his home in Rotterdam, N.Y. It took him two hours, and the trip to work was treacherous. Most of downtown Schenectady was still closed at noon, he said. ''We have had maybe five customers all day long,'' he said. ''Sometimes you feel like why are you here?'' Some complained of aching backs after hours of trying to free their automobiles from the drifts. Kelly Pagano, a 23-year-old insurance claims processor, gave up and hired a passing crew to dig out his girlfriend's car in central Albany. ''I usually do my share of digging out cars every season,'' he said. ''But they came along and said $20. My back hurts just enough to pay them that kind of money.'' Most people, however, took the storm with good cheer. For some, it meant employment. Asked if the early winter bothered him, John DeShaw, 30, a highway worker who was digging out cars for $20 apiece, said, ''No way, I want it to go on.'' Skiers were also happy, as the slopes in the Catskills and Berkshires promised heavenly runs. David Mominee, a 29-year-old computer engineer who was looking for a shovel to find his car with, said the skiing was abysmal last year, but not this time around. A Brooklyn native, Mr. Mominee said New York City residents did not understand the winter mindset among residents upstate, where it is embraced. ''Down there you get 6 inches and people go crazy,'' he said. ''Up here, if you aren't going 60 on the Thruway with 2 feet of snow, you are considered a tourist.''"
"The power went out for several hours. Nearly a foot of snow accumulated. Tree branches stockinged in white drooped ominously. It was another sublime snowstorm in the suburbs. Snow in the city may have its charms, especially on Christmas. But snow in the suburbs, especially a hilly hamlet like this one far north of Manhattan, is something else entirely. Snow grinches of course will curse the slick roads and the chore of shoveling. ''This is not good,'' said Lorenzo Salzano as he shoveled a neighbor's driveway (yes, they do that here). ''This is just too much. And it's wet and heavy.'' Mr. Salzano, however, seemed in the minority. Maybe everyone else had snow blowers or private plowers, for the prevailing sentiment was very different in the Kelloggs and Lawrence hardware store. Nina Nadelman's three children had already buried themselves in the snow and built a snow fort. Now, she dashed into the store to buy a sled -- perfect for wet and packed snow -- and head for the park. Everybody was heading to the park. ''We haven't had snow for ages during the week when they are on vacation,'' Ms. Nadelman said, heading for the door. Everybody, it seemed, was at Katonah Memorial Park. They were sledding and skiing and snowboarding and talking on their cellphones about sledding and skiing and snowboarding. A group of teenagers had piled snow into a mound for jumping. ''He's good,'' said Tom Sweeney, 17, watching his snowboarding friend Lev Berlin show off. Mr. Berlin glided down a trail, flew up the mound and sailed through the air with a look equal parts glee and terror (he would admit only to the glee). ''It's exhilarating, I guess,'' said Mr. Sweeney, who was sitting out a few turns, nursing a sore neck. Older children like Brian Summers, 57, and his wife, Kathryn, 64, tackled the hill with a relish belying their ages. Mrs. Summers said that Katonah often reminded her of her native Vermont: woodsy, hilly, country flavor. Well, all right, with an hour commute on the train to Manhattan, a spa and a chain health-food store it is not exactly deep woods. But the healthy blast of snow made it seem almost home. ''I never got good at skiing because we were dairy farmers,'' Mrs. Summers said, panting from another run down the hill on her sled. ''I was always shoveling manure.'' The Summerses didn't seem to mind the nearly five hours without electricity on Christmas. Or the treacherous roads, most of which had been plowed by mid-afternoon. Or the cold or the wind. At the Katonah Restaurant, Peter Miller, visiting from the city, downed coffee on his way to meet a friend. He considered the snow experience he had left and the one he had just entered. ''People in the city don't get snow, really,'' he said. ''It snowed five inches down there but it will be gone from the streets by morning. Here, it always snows more and it stays and stays, and if you like it, that's great.'' Mr. Miller does not like it. ''I like looking at it here -- it's pretty -- but a few hours is enough for me. I guess it would get a little boring after a while, snow all the time.'' This snowfall will surely be memorable, if only for the timing. That's the way Peter Spink, out sledding with his two children, preferred to see it. ''It's the best winter yet,'' he said, and then he motioned to his children. ''These guys are going to remember this winter forever.'' Katonah Journal"
"If you took the trouble to consult a weather map on Christmas morning you would have seen a remarkable sight, the track of a long belt of bad weather reaching from western Kansas all the way up into New England. Forecasters predicted that the storm would hit the East Coast in the early morning, but the snow didn't begin to fall in earnest till early afternoon. In every other respect, this was a truly timely winter storm. It caught most travelers already at their destinations and on a day when they could sit back, have a second helping of Christmas dinner and watch the snow blot out the horizon. As the snowfall came to an end late that night, the wind picked up and by morning it had driven the snow into scallops and cornices all across the landscape, and done it effortlessly. But there was nothing effortless about the plowing out. Snow crews worked through the night all across the Northeast and didn't begin to catch up until yesterday morning. At the edge of nearly every sizable piece of tarmac a range of snowy peaks arose like some minor Himalaya. Many homeowners, armed only with plastic snow shovels or perhaps an underpowered snow blower, found themselves completely overmatched by the storm and wishing that Christmas could have lasted another 24 hours. Even in the truck stops, oases of self-reliance, young men with snowplowing jobs and too much coffee in their blood compared notes excitedly with long-haul truckers who had been driven into refuge by the late-night closing of one section of the New York State Thruway. Around Albany, this was the ninth-fiercest winter storm since records began to be kept in 1884. Not exactly the storm of storms, in other words, but one that no one will soon forget. In New York City the weather wore a more benign aspect, making the city seem more seasonal than it has in a long time. Like all heavy storms, this one brought power failures, motoring accidents and a string of weather-related deaths. But it also brought something else, a welcome sense of confinement on Christmas Day and the glimpse of a world that looked as if it had been rechristened in the night. This was one dark cloud that left its silver lining behind when it finally blew away."
"The first major winter storm of the season -- uncommon in its timing and its intensity -- bullied its way up the Eastern Seaboard yesterday, snarling airports and highways, closing schools and offices and blanketing New York with more snow in a single day than the city received through all of last winter. The vast storm caused thousands of traffic accidents from North Carolina to Connecticut as it barreled across a third of the country in the last few days, powered by a blast of arctic air and an intensifying El Ni√±o that meteorologists are predicting will cause extreme weather well into next year. For many, though, the oddest aspect of the storm was that so much snow fell so early. Winter does not formally begin until Dec. 22, but meteorologists consider the first week of December the beginning of the season. Nothing like this storm has come to New York City since 1938, according to meteorological records. Coming just a week after Thanksgiving, and with leaves still clinging to the sycamore trees in Bryant Park, the snow was a blustery dose of weather reality for those lulled by years of mild winters into thinking that the season is no longer what it used to be. The six inches that fell on Central Park by late last night was nearly double the 3.5 inches that was recorded throughout all of last winter. ''This could be payback time,'' said Frederick J. Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. ''Cold and snow are still a part of New York winter weather. This early taste of winter should be a reminder of that.'' And a reminder that snow brings both economic costs and benefits. For ski resorts in the area, the first significant snowfall since February 2001 is a welcome blast of winter. The storm will also lay down snow cover that will help replenish reservoirs badly hurt by a lack of significant snow last year. Malls and stores just beginning their crucial holiday shopping seasons are hoping that the snow will be a wash, making it difficult for shoppers to travel for a while but convincing them that Christmas is only three weeks away. The storm was also a fiscal reality check for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other elected officials in the region, who are struggling to balance their budgets. For them, the accumulating piles of snow look like nothing so much as mounting debts. ''Every mayor would love to have very few snow days,'' Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday as he took command of the first snow emergency of his administration. Facing a $6.4 billion deficit next year, the mayor equated snowflakes with dollar signs, telling reporters that it costs the city about $1 million an inch to clear the snow. A four- to six-inch snowfall in the first week of December would clearly make a substantial dent in the city's $20 million snow removal budget. Still, streets had to be cleared. The city's armada of 1,000 plow trucks and 2,300 sanitation workers began work at daybreak and continued throughout the day as the snow continued falling heavily, snarling traffic on city streets and for suburban commuters throughout the region. Gray skies and swirling snow made it difficult to see more than a few blocks around Times Square, and forced Staten Island Ferry pilots to slow down crossing times until visibility improved. But the signs of winter were unmistakable everywhere. By late afternoon, street corners in Times Square were overflowing with slush the consistency of leftover farina; snowblowers that had not been fired up all last winter were coaxed, stumbling and coughing, out of storage; and bicycle messengers tried to continue looking cool as they negotiated slippery streets while pedaling in yellow rubber boots. Meteorologists at the National Weather Service consider this storm ''noteworthy'' because of its power and unusual timing. They have followed it intensely since it gathered strength in the Western states earlier this week. Jim Hoke, director of the service's hydrometeorological prediction center, said the storm ran along a rough axis from Oklahoma to North Carolina before turning northeast along the coast. ''That's when a nor'easter developed off the North Carolina coast,'' Dr. Hoke said. The storm hit North and South Carolina particularly hard, pelting large sections of the states with freezing rain and unaccustomed snow. Electric service to 1.5 million people in both states was knocked out, and highways became automotive skating rinks as drivers with little experience with freezing conditions tried to negotiate dark and snow-slicked roads. At least 20 people have died in the storm since it roared out of the West, news agencies reported. Authorities said eight people were killed in traffic accidents in Kentucky and Missouri. On Long Island, the acclaimed tenor saxophone player Bob Berg, 51, of East Hampton was killed and his wife, Arja, 52, was injured yesterday morning on Route 27 when their car was struck by a cement truck, the authorities said. She was in stable condition last night in Southampton Hospital, a hospital spokeswoman said. Carolina Power and Light reported that 470,000 customers in North Carolina were without power yesterday afternoon. Duke University had to cancel a national Internet chat it had planned for prospective students Wednesday night because the organizers could not get to the campus. After turning toward the Northeast, the storm plowed up the coast, dumping six inches of snow in Washington, Baltimore and other major cities. The snow made winter seem to encroach on autumn the way the hockey season seems to overlap with football. The last time it snowed so much so early was in 1938, when a late November storm dumped 8.8 inches in New York City. Yesterday morning, snow started falling in the New York region about 7 a.m., beating forecasts by a few hours. Classes in many southern New Jersey schools were canceled before children arrived. In other areas, schools were open but classes were dismissed early. Two days of subfreezing temperatures earlier in the week meant that snow began accumulating as soon as the first flakes hit the pavement, offering the kind of day tow truck drivers like Frank Guenther live for. ''Today is the money day,'' said Mr. Guenther as he hooked chains from his tow truck to a white Ford van that had spun off the Garden State Parkway near Pleasantville, N.J. Mr. Guenther, 37, said his family's business, Guenther & Sons Towing, had 10 trucks out and could not respond to all the calls that came in. Sgt. Kevin Rehmann of the New Jersey State Police estimated that there were hundreds of minor accidents across New Jersey. And although the southern part of the state received more snow, Sergeant Rehmann said it was the more heavily traveled northern section, around Interstates 80, 78 and 287, where most of the accidents were concentrated. On Long Island, there were power failures and at least 280 minor accidents by midafternoon, even as hundreds of snowplows tried to keep major expressways clear. Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, said the county's budget problems made the early snow more unwelcome than usual. He estimated that the storm would cost the county nearly $150,000, and said, ''If this happens an awful lot between now and the end of the year, we're going to have a problem.'' Keeping highways clear and traffic flowing also taxed New Jersey's officials. Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for Gov. James E. McGreevey, said the state had spent money clearing roads after a series of small ice storms in recent weeks. ''While the budget for snow removal and storm preparation is not broke,'' Mr. Davitt said, ''it's perilously close, and this doesn't help.'' The region's trains were a far safer and more reliable bet than cars for most of the day. The Metro-North Railroad reported that its trains were running on or close to schedule throughout the day. New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road began experiencing 15- to 20-minute delays by early evening. The snow and near freezing temperatures caused mounting delays of up to five hours at metropolitan area airports. By late afternoon, flights leaving Newark Liberty International Airport were delayed by as much as four hours. Incoming flights did little better, being delayed by about two hours. Dozens of flights were canceled throughout the day. La Guardia Airport and Kennedy Airport both had substantial delays and cancellations. Noting that hundreds of travelers were likely to be stranded, Mayor Bloomberg encouraged them to bring ''books and magazines to read.'' In Connecticut, which was hit hard by a snowstorm last week that skirted New York and New Jersey, Gov. John G. Rowland ordered agency heads to dismiss all nonessential state workers at 1 p.m. A long line of cars, their headlights glittering in the gray afternoon, stretched down arteries leading out of Hartford. Children throughout the region were delighted by the early onset of winter, and undoubtedly hoped that a big snowfall during the first week of December would lead to many other snow days -- and school cancellations -- before spring, which is not entirely wishful thinking. ''It certainly is possible that this storm is a harbinger of what is to come this winter,'' said Dr. Hoke of the National Weather Service. With El Ni√±o threatening to stir up trouble, there is an increased likelihood of more winter storms, he said, but ''winter storms do not necessarily mean snow'' in this area. Despite the professional prognostications, some people remain convinced that old-fashioned winters are unlikely to return. Keith Desimone, a computer network consultant from Garden City, N.Y., who works on Wall Street, said he doubted the early snowfall was an omen of a cruel winter. ''Weather is so crazy, I wouldn't count on it,'' said Mr. Desimone, 25. ''For all we know, this could be the only snow we get all winter.'' DECEMBER SURPRISE: THE STORM Correction: December 9, 2002, Monday An article on Friday about the weather misstated the last time an intense snowstorm came to New York City this early in the season. It was on Dec. 3 and 4, 1957, when eight inches fell in Central Park, not in 1938."
"A storm system heading for the Northeast yesterday held the prospect of snow for the Christmas holiday in the New York City region, but forecasters said there would be little accumulation until late today. ''We have an intense East Coast storm developing,'' said George Klein, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service on Long Island. But instead of snow, he said, most of what falls during daylight hours will be sleet and rain, with no more than an inch or two accumulating by 6 p.m. Then, with the temperature falling from the mid-30's to below freezing tonight, the snow accumulation should grow to as much as four inches, he said. The forecast, which Mr. Klein said should apply across the city, Long Island, much of northern New Jersey, southern Westchester County, and Fairfield County, Conn., was actually for more of a wind-whipped and wet Christmas than a white one. He said some snow was expected to fall before dawn, but would mix with sleet and rain, and daylight hours would bring heavy rain and wind gusts up to 45 miles per hour. In northern Westchester and Rockland Counties and northwestern Connecticut, the snow was expected to fall all day, adding up to a foot or more. Despite the mixed and somewhat messy outlook for New York City, some weather watchers were savoring the prospect of snow on Christmas Day, even if it is mainly on Christmas night. ''There hasn't been anything substantially like a white Christmas in a long time,'' said Stephen Fybish, a Manhattan climate researcher. Mr. Fybish said determining when the city had its last white Christmas was a judgment call. There was snow on the ground on Christmas Day in 1998, he said. But his records show that that snow, amounting to only two inches, had fallen on Christmas Eve, and remained because of sub-freezing temperatures. None fell on Christmas Day itself. The last time more than an inch of snow fell on Christmas Day was in 1969, Mr. Fybish said. That snowfall bore similarities to the one forecast for today, starting late in the day, with an accumulation of 2.1 inches, and continuing into the following day."
"A northeaster battered the East Coast yesterday with sleet, freezing rain and snow that closed airports and major highways and gave New York City its whitest Christmas since 1909. It was not what Irving Berlin had in mind. It was wet, slippery and dangerous. Whipping winds and icy slime shut down the city's two airports, made traveling by car perilous and kept people who were planning to venture out for a holiday meal holed up at home. As of midnight, 5 inches of snow had fallen on Central Park, the only significant snow on Christmas inside the city since 1969, when 2.1 inches fell. That made it the first official white Christmas -- defined by meteorologists as a Dec. 25 with one inch on the ground -- in 33 years. The only other New York City white Christmas of the 20th century came in 1909, when seven inches fell, according to Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. There have been dustings and traces, to use the technical terms, in the city on several Christmases past, and some New Yorkers may be positive that they have, in fact, frolicked through many a white Christmas in the 1970's, 1980's and 1990's. The unusual holiday snowfall came as the storm pounded much of the Northeast, turning from icy rain and sleet into snow in the late afternoon, as temperatures fell below freezing. By the time the snow started tapering off late last night, records for Christmas Day had been set in Buffalo and other parts of upstate New York that reported more than two feet of snow. Officials were forced to close a 100-mile stretch of the New York State Thruway from Syracuse to Amsterdam, near Albany. Around the city, the snowfall was heaviest in the suburbs, with 9.2 inches reported in Valley Stream on Long Island as of 9:30 p.m. and similar amounts north of the city. Today's forecast called for windy and sunny weather, with highs in the mid-30's. . Once the snow began yesterday afternoon, it fell at a furious pace -- at least two inches an hour -- and it was met with a mixture of delight and misery. For anyone trying to travel -- or work -- on the holiday, there was the unpleasantness of having snow spraying into their faces, or their shoes sliding across the sidewalk, their cars trundling slowly across slippery, unplowed roads or their flights delayed or canceled. ''Life is very miserable,'' said Mutfar Rasman, 54, a Bangladeshi immigrant who was pumping gas at a Sunoco station in the Van Cortlandt section of the Bronx late yesterday, as the snow, which had soaked his gloves so much that he finally removed them, began to fall faster and faster. ''It might be good for Americans, but for me, it's very difficult.'' There was a clear difference of opinion across the region yesterday as to whether snow on Christmas -- the kind of snow that fell yesterday, anyway -- was something to cherish or something to curse. For Juan Carlos Alvarez, 34, who moved to Manhattan from Miami six months ago, the notion of a white Christmas made him giddy. ''Yeah, snow -- it's perfect,'' he shouted into his cellphone yesterday, as he stood in Rockefeller Center and chatted with a friend in Utah while the snow began to fall. ''I couldn't have planned it any better. This is Christmas in New York, right? That's what it's all about.'' Earlier yesterday, the city Sanitation Department deployed 500 workers and 359 salt spreaders, officials said. But they did not start plowing the roads until about 4 p.m., after waiting for at least an inch to an inch and a half to accumulate. Vito Turso, a spokesman for the department, said the city reacted ''right according to plan,'' with 1,000 pieces of equipment out on the streets by about 9 p.m., including salt spreaders and dump trucks, and a total of 1,600 workers deployed overnight to clear the streets. After being closed for about four hours, runways at La Guardia Airport reopened at 10 p.m., and runways at Kennedy reopened at 11:30 p.m.Alan Hicks, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said that flights were expected to depart through the night, to make up for lost time. He said that Christmas was not a heavy travel day. Newark Liberty International Airport remained open, although flights were delayed for up to two hours. Many of those who had planned to fly wished they had not. At the Spirit Airlines check-in counter at La Guardia yesterday evening, an argument between irate passengers and airline employees, some wearing cheerful red Santa caps, became so heated that someone summoned police at the airport. One of the angry passengers was Chelsea Rudder, 19, a student at Pace University who had planned to fly to Detroit for a family gathering. ''My Christmas is ruined,'' said Ms. Rudder, dressed in a festive red fur-trimmed coat. Among waiting passengers, a 4-year-old girl slept on the floor, using her mother's black coat as a blanket. Adults slept on rocking chairs set in front of windows, which looked out on snowplows and tractors. An information clerk asked earnestly whether information was needed, and a man lugging two duffel bags snapped, ''I need something, and it ain't information.'' At Kennedy, American Airlines Flight 2 from Los Angeles landed safely about 5:30 p.m., but the plane was stuck on the runway until about 11 p.m., said Andrew Schneider, 31, a passenger. Passengers kept their tempers under control. ''I think the whole Christmas spirit kind of calmed people down,'' Mr. Schneider reported by cellphone, as his 3-month-old son, Sam, fussed in the background. ''No one was happy to be sitting on the plane for five hours, but no one was getting irate.'' About 9,000 people on the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens lost electrical power yesterday afternoon. It was restored by 10:30 p.m. Officials said it was unclear whether the problem was related to the storm. In Westchester, 1,200 Con Edison customers lost power in the morning in what officials said was a weather-related incident, and an additional 300 homes in the Sea Gate neighborhood of Brooklyn lost power because of ice on the wires. On the Upper West Side, a few hours after the snow began to stick, the streets were quiet. Parents wearing pained-looking expressions held hands with children wearing puffy coats, trying to hurry them home. Winds whipped snowflakes into people's eyes, and men with wool hats shoveled snow at bodegas. Snow collected gracefully on the branches of trees along Riverside Drive, but the winds were so fierce -- reaching 40 miles per hour -- that there were few people around to appreciate the wonderland effect. Blanca E. Salazar, 31, a Mexican immigrant visiting from North Carolina, stood on 101st Street and videotaped the scene as cars, most of them taxis, streamed down a Broadway sprinkled with snow. She had no hat, and snowflakes collected on Ms. Salazar's shiny black hair. But that was a small price to pay, she said, for the joy her relatives in Mexico would get from watching a home movie of a snowy New York. ''I love snow, I love it,'' said Ms. Salazar, slipping her video camera into her jacket. ''I think it's a great day, a beautiful day.'' In the suburbs, where the storm dropped as much as half a foot or more, people able to stay inside said they felt cozy, but many plans were changed. Danielle and Robert Goodman held a holiday party in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., but three out of the four families they invited could not make it last night because of the bad driving conditions. But for those who were there, said Ms. Goodman, ''the spirits are high. It's beautiful, like a fairyland outside.'' The snowstorm, which moved out of the central Plains, was blamed for at least 18 deaths since Monday. The intense weather system moved east Tuesday night, from the Midwest into Pennsylvania and then into New York and New England. Most of the storm-related deaths were caused by traffic accidents. Since Monday, six people were killed in Missouri, four in Oklahoma, three in Kansas and one in New Mexico. Numerous accidents were reported yesterday in the New York region, but the police said none were serious. And for city drivers, at least there was a parking reprieve: alternate-side regulations will be suspended today. Correction: December 27, 2002, Friday A front-page article yesterday about the East Coast snowstorm misstated meteorologists' definition of a white Christmas and, because of an editing error, misstated the number of New York City snowfalls in the 20th century that fulfilled it. The phenomenon occurs when at least one inch of snow falls on the holiday itself and sticks -- not merely when an inch is present on the ground. There were three white Christmases in the century, not two. In addition to the one in 1909 (7 inches) and the one in 1969 (2.1 inches), 6.5 inches of snow fell on Christmas 1902, according to records at Pennsylvania State University."
"Since the beginning of November, eight considerable snowstorms have blown across our hillside farm in upstate New York, and the ninth is still falling as I write. ''Considerable'' means I have to rake off the roof and plow out the driveway with the tractor. A part of me would like to compare the not-yet winter we've had so far with winters past, but so much snow seems to have blotted out my weather memory. The one thing I do remember is this: you have to be careful where you dump the season's first tractor-bucket full of snow because that's where all the rest of the plowed snow -- a mountain of it -- will inevitably go. I don't know why. That's just the way it is. Last week, nearly all that snow, except the mountain I started six weeks ago, suddenly melted away. The creeks and rivers ran bank-high, the water almost glutinous with earth as it skidded under bridges and through culverts. Ice in the ponds looked like a layer of platinum gelatin on the point of dissolving. For a few days the grass lay bare again. Coming in from feeding the other afternoon, I saw a midge hovering in midair like a self-propelled snowflake. Christmas came with heavy flights of snow, to borrow an old phrase, and soon I'll probably be muttering and cursing all over again, the way I found myself doing a few weeks ago. It was a 2-degree morning. I was thawing and refilling frozen poultry waterers. One of the waterers came apart when I picked it up and soaked my jeans and boots. It seemed like a lot to go through just for fresh eggs. But even as I said those words to myself, along with some that can't be printed here, I thought about the real farmers in my family, aunts and uncles and cousins who farm in the Midwest and have no choice but to accept the weather just as it is. I've been trying on this small place to cross over into their country. Every now and then something reminds me how far I really have to go. Knocking the ice out of chicken waterers isn't hard work. Getting soaked in 2-degree weather isn't a big deal when the house is 50 yards away. A dozen and a half eggs a day doesn't make the difference between being in the red or the black. I wondered how I'd feel if I'd planted a half-section of soybeans at the beginning of a month-long drought or got drowned out of a record-breaking corn harvest in early November. I wondered if I'd have the fortitude just to live with it, which is the only choice, after all. There's insurance for the big crop failures but none for the failures of mood I sometimes experience up here. I've seen my uncles get terribly angry. But when they do it's always at some human shortcoming, a failure of effort or attention or intelligence. They know how to ride out the weather, to take it as it comes. It's taken me five years here even to see the problem. I wonder now how long it will take to fix it. VERLYN KLINKENBORG The Rural Life"
"How different this week's conversational calculus is from last week's. Last week's math involved inches: The 19.8 inches in Central Park. The 28 inches in Howard Beach, Queens. The piles that seemed greater in places the National Weather Service did not measure, like around parked cars on freshly plowed streets. This week's math involves tons: 50,000, by the city's estimate. What was being measured last week, of course, was snow. What is being measured this week is that other thing that the Sanitation Department is responsible for removing, garbage. On blocks throughout the city yesterday, the two were side by side. The snow stood a bit shorter than before Friday's rain, which went on long enough to smooth the faces of the glaciers rising from the gutters, and Sunday's 37-degree high, which was warm enough to accelerate the melting. The garbage was in plastic bags and bundles, boxes and garbage cans. There were blocks where it filled the shovel-width walkways that had been carved out last week. There were blocks where it stood on what was left of the glaciers. There were blocks where the melting snow exposed a discarded coffee cup or two, along with evidence that dogs had made their rounds in the snow, even if the street sweeping machines had not. And there were blocks where homeowners complained that life had become like something out of Beckett: It was cold. They were waiting for the garbage truck. Maybe it would come tomorrow. Laura Gross, who lives on 84th Road in Bellerose, Queens, said she had not seen a truck in almost two weeks, since the Wednesday before the blizzard. She ran out of garbage cans to fill several days ago. The dirty diapers (she has a 2-year-old) and the pizza boxes (she has three other children, ages 7, 9 and 16) have been going into plastic bags. The plastic bags went into the street yesterday in anticipation of a garbage truck that had not come. ''I'm such a neatnik, I hate garbage around,'' she said. ''I was telling my husband we should bring it in because it's embarrassing.'' Down the block, Fred Cevasco said he had called the Sanitation Department to find out why his garbage had gone uncollected. ''They gave the excuse that they're plowing,'' he said. ''I'm tired of calling. I'm going to take that garbage and fling it out in the street.'' But that would be littering, and besides, he said, he has a heart problem, so he should not be exerting himself by throwing things. The Sanitation Department's explanation was, more or less, this: Yes, there is a lot of garbage on the streets, and the department spent much of last week getting rid of that other thing, snow. That Monday, for example, the department was fully focused on plowing.Yesterday, the department was fully focused on collecting garbage, with 1,340 trucks on the streets. On any other Monday, the department would have dispatched only 904 trucks. ''We have really been making a yeoman's effort'' to pick up garbage that accumulated during the blizzard, said Kathy Dawkins, a Sanitation Department spokeswoman. There is a lot to pick up, she said -- the department averages 13,000 tons a day. ''That's an estimate,'' Ms. Dawkins said. ''That's not gospel.'' She said that employees had worked 12-hour shifts over the weekend and again yesterday. ''The department did a fantastic job in collecting the snow in less than a week,'' she said. ''We're moving on.'' In fact, the department missed only three garbage-collection days last week; Monday was a holiday and pickups resumed Friday. Ms. Dawkins counseled patience. ''Keep in mind what we were doing,'' she said. ''There was two and a half feet of snow that had to be cleared away. Let's not lose sight of that.'' There were blocks where the Sanitation Department's trucks were making the rounds, but those belonging to commercial garbage haulers were apparently not. ''You can't expect them to work miracles,'' said Cynthia Simeone as she walked along 73rd Street between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue. ''The snow was very high.''"
"Sure, the brutality of winter could be measured on a thermometer, in inches of snow or the number of ice-induced traffic accidents. But winter can also be judged by the prominence of another scourge, one that is especially irksome in a city that places a premium on being well-groomed and immaculately coiffed: hat hair. This year, even those New Yorkers who are generally intent on maintaining static-free locks and smooth-looking strands have put their vanity aside, choosing the well-being of their ears and foreheads over the preservation of their tresses and blow-outs. ''It's frizzy and matted and creased,'' said Janine Kenna Dozier, who offered a definition of hat hair from firsthand experience. The part of her long red mane that has spent much of the winter concealed by a corduroy bucket hat offered a visual aid. ''Hat hair is a serious affliction, but warmth is more important on days like this.'' It has been an unforgiving winter, and it is getting worse. Yesterday, as snow began to fall in the city, weather forecasters were predicting a blizzard that could leave the New York metropolitan region with more than a foot of snow by the end of today, a predicament that challenged even those men and women who until now had resisted berets, fedoras and ski caps alike. So Ms. Dozier, 29, accompanied her sister, Justine Kenna, 24, to Bloomingdale's. It was there that Ms. Kenna, who had warded off her sister's frizzes and creases all winter, surrendered, buying a terry cloth Puma hat. ''With the blizzard coming tomorrow,'' Ms. Kenna said, ''it's time.'' For Louis C. Mosher, a technology consultant, the turning point came the day his hair actually froze when he left the gym while it was wet and uncovered. Until then, he had made it through the winter hatless, to the bafflement of the colleagues who asked him about it each time they would leave the office for lunch. ''I generally am conscious about my hair looking not too sloppy,'' Mr. Mosher, 33, explained. ''It's been a very rough winter. Cold, and definitely a pretty harsh winter for people who aren't wearing hats.'' Yesterday, Mr. Mosher wore a yellow-and-gray fleece cap that he normally reserves for skiing. At a reporter's request, he whisked it off, revealing tufts of fine, blondish-brown hair, some of it sticking out in different directions. One way around hat hair is to simply buy a hat so stylish that it seems appropriate for indoor wear. ''I don't do a lot of taking on and off the hat,'' said Erica S. Nicotra, 29, a painter and assistant wardrobe stylist who wore a 1950's-vintage shearling hat as she sat with her husband inside a juice bar in the West Village. Erin Fallon, 30, a photographer, takes a similar approach. ''It looks better when it's on,'' said Ms. Fallon, whose white aviator-style cap was strapped beneath her chin as she left the Blue Ribbon Bakery in the Village yesterday. She demonstrated, taking the cap off to reveal a discombobulated mess of locks. Suzanne E. Cohen, 32, knit her partner, Eileen Fagan, 41, a roomy hat just to minimize the hat-hair effect. ''A tight hat flattens the hair,'' Ms. Cohen explained. If you think hat hair is bad, beware its ugly cousin, hood hair. This can be worse, because not only is the hair compressed beneath the hood for extended periods of time, but it is ruffled each time the hood is pulled on and off. This is why Anne D. Pine, a speech pathologist, owns three hooded coats but uses their hoods only in ''very dire'' circumstances. Kevin Kager, a stylist at the Jeffrey Stein Salon, on the Upper West Side, said he usually forgoes hats, figuring, ''The price you have to pay to look good is a little pain.'' Yesterday, he wore one, a Russian-looking fur hat with earflaps. He restyled his hair after arriving at work, explaining that given his profession, ''it has to look a certain way.'' Todd E. Loewy, 24, a mechanical engineer, insisted that the flattened brown curls beneath his white baseball cap amounted to only a ''minor setback.'' ''It's no big deal,'' he said, popping off the cap. There are victors in an image-conscious city so cold that it is filled with mussed tresses and matted frizzes, and Seth J. Cohen, 31, a comedian and bartender whose head is perfectly shaved, counts himself among them. ''I don't have hat head,'' he boasted."
"A major storm swamped a winter-weary East Coast today, dumping snow over a large swath of the Middle Atlantic, slowing commerce and travel and affecting national security during a three-day weekend. Even President Bush acquiesced to the storm. His 14-car motorcade spent two and a half hours slogging over the highways between Camp David and the White House, a distance that typically can be covered in a 30-minute helicopter ride. Upon returning to the White House, the president's dogs, like many fun-loving people, frolicked in the snow. The slow storm, which crept east from the central Plains, spanned the Eastern Seaboard from North Carolina to Pennsylvania, shutting down airports and closing malls and museums on the Presidents' Day weekend. As the storm moved north along the I-95 corridor toward southern New England, forecasters were predicting a foot or more of snow for the New York-New Jersey area. The brunt of the storm hit around Washington, giving the capital its most significant snowfall in seven years. Brian Korty, a forecaster for the National Weather Service, predicted that by Monday morning the storm would leave as much as two feet of snow in parts of Virginia and Maryland, making it one of the region's top five snowfalls on record. Washington's worst snowfall was the 1922 Knickerbocker Storm, so called because the 28 inches of snow that fell crushed the roof of the Knickerbocker Theater, killing about 100 people. One by one, states declared a state of emergency today as the storm swept north. The emergency status contributes to the burden of the National Guard, which now must contend with snowdrifts along with counterterrorism duties. In the New York metropolitan region, residents jammed supermarkets and hardware stores today, stocking up on everything from milk to rock salt as forecasters warned that up to two feet of snow could blanket the area by late Monday. In Washington, the weather forced the government to curtail the high security it has maintained on the streets in the last week, after the terrorist threat level was raised to Code Orange. Counterterrorism agencies were forced to get by with less staff. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents were out in four-wheel- drive vehicles, but the high-level presence of recent days was scaled back because of the weather. The snow crept into every corner of life, including church services, shopping and romantic Valentine's Day weekends. One couple who had planned to be married on Sunday night determined not to let the snow be a deterrent. Shannon Garvey and David Hughes arranged to have a dozen S.U.V.'s move a hundred guests to the Quaker House in Northwest Washington. ''Here is one day when people have a reason to drive S.U.V.'s,'' said Riley Robinson, administrative secretary of the Friends Meeting of Washington, who was helping to coordinate the wedding. The caterer also moved the reception to the Quaker House. ''They are moving heaven, earth and snow to have that wedding today,'' Mr. Robinson said. Amtrak said it experienced a 20 percent increase in northbound ticket sales from Washington, as people hedged against the airport shutdowns in the region. Reagan National Airport and Baltimore Washington International airport both closed, while Dulles International Airport kept one runway open but canceled many flights. Train service south of Washington was stopped. Commerce and tourism ground to a halt in the greater Washington area, as monuments, memorials, theaters and the Smithsonian Institution closed. Shopping malls shut down despite Sunday newspaper circulars advertising Presidents' Day sales. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington announced that people were not obligated to attend Mass this morning. Mansir Petrie, who is a Quaker, had a number of his religious meetings canceled, which allowed him to go for a five-mile run in Rock Creek Park in the morning. ''God said, 'Play in the snow today,' '' he said. One of Washington's largest homeless shelters, run by the Center for Creative Non-Violence, was pushed beyond capacity as many people sought shelter. ''We don't have actual beds to put them in,'' said Kerri Bishop, executive director of the center. ''We're putting them on mattresses, putting them in chairs, putting them on wherever they can sit just to get them inside out of the cold.'' Mayor Anthony A. Williams arranged to fly back from Puerto Rico, mindful of the blistering attacks that former Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. suffered in 1987 when he was attending the Super Bowl in California as snow cleanup efforts stumbled. By early morning, Washington-area plows were engaging in a Sisyphean battle with the storm, which was leaving about an inch of snowfall every hour. Local television news cameras in Washington showed cars getting towed or slapped with $250 tickets for parking in a snow emergency zone. Trafficland.com, a regional traffic Webcam site for the Washington area, had its engineers working overtime to keep up with the hundredfold increase in visitors eager to peek out from their white cocoons. ''All the servers are screaming,'' said Larry Nelson, president of the company. ''It's scorching.'' Mr. Nelson estimated that the site would have between 16 million and 20 million hits by the end of the day. The previous peak was 4 million. For millions, it was a time when home became a refuge and ''family time'' was either a welcome necessity or a daunting bout of cabin fever. People coped with leisurely brunches, video rentals and shoveling neighbors' driveways. The intrepid went cross-country skiing in the park, leaving long, delicate trails in otherwise undisturbed snow and accumulating icicles on their eyelashes. One doctor from Georgetown University Hospital, wearing only his green medical pants and white laboratory coat in the heavily falling snow, took a quick break and borrowed a sled from a local family for a few quick runs down the hill before returning to his rounds. In a region full of transplants, some found the city's awe toward the snowfall a bit mystifying and a little overblown. ''I grew up in Michigan and I have lived in Iowa,'' said Adam Goldberg, who lives in Fairfax County, Va. ''In both places, people wouldn't pull their head into the shell and shut down for 24 hours.'' In a normally partisan and contentious city, the snow was a uniting force, pitting everyone against nature. ''It gets very friendly when it snows here,'' said Robert Gellman, a privacy policy consultant who lives on Capitol Hill. ''People interact in ways that they normally wouldn't in normal times. There is a more of a community spirit.'' But that sense, he said, lasts only as long as the fresh snow does. ''When the snow melts,'' Mr. Gellman said, ''life goes back to normal and you start ignoring people on the street like you normally do.''"
"Residents of the New York metropolitan region jammed supermarkets and hardware stores yesterday, stocking up on everything from milk to rock salt as forecasters warned that up to two feet of snow could blanket the area by late tonight. By 10:30 last night, the storm, which swept up the Atlantic coast from Virginia, had left more than 16 inches of snow in sections of South Jersey, prompting Gov. James E. McGreevey to declare a state of emergency, giving the state police the authority to close highways. With predictions of more than a foot of new snow by tonight across the region, from Trenton to New Haven, the National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning shortly after 10 p.m. for New York City and 15 counties to its west and north. That followed a similar warning for residents of southern New Jersery. The warning underscored a threat for motorists of high winds combined with the dense snowfall, which could create situations in which visibility is reduced to dangerous levels. Snow began falling about 6 p.m. in Midtown Manhattan, and two inches of new snow had accumulated in Central Park four hours later. But forecasters said the bulk of the snow would not pile up until today and tonight. The National Weather Service had predicted a total accumulation in Central Park of up to 15 inches, but it was revising that forecast last night, based on the size and movement of the storm system. ''We are looking at the numbers, and there are good indications they will turn out on the low side,'' said Joe Tabaco, a National Weather Service meteoroligist in Brookhaven. He said a revised forecast would probably call for up to 18 inches in Central Park. ''This is a once-in-a-decade event,'' said Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. ''It's not the worst, but it's not really normal.'' A total of 20.2 inches of snow was recorded in Central Park during the blizzard of Jan. 7 and 8, 1996, which brought the region to a near standstill. Mr. Miner said that the route of the latest storm was likely to mimic that of the 1996 blizzard, which blanketed Washington, Philadelphia New York and southern New England. But its practical impact is likely to be much less because today is a holiday, Washington's Birthday. Government offices across the region are closed, as are most schools and banks. Officials of the New York City Department of Sanitation said all of its 350 salt spreaders had been loaded and were ready to go at the first trace of snow. Sanitation Commissioner John J. Doherty said that as many as 1,800 snow plows would be deployed, but that it would be difficult to plow secondary and tertiary streets if more than a foot of snow fell. Mr. Doherty said 4,000 sanitation employees would work 12-hour shifts, with half starting at 7 last night and the remainder at 7 a.m. today. ''We're hoping that everyone stays home, relaxes, enjoys the snow storm, goes out and plays,'' Mr. Doherty said yesterday at a news conference. ''Leave the roads to Sanitation.'' City officials estimate that snow removal costs about $1 million per inch. The cost will be higher today, because workers will be paid at time and a half for the holiday. At the Foodtown supermarket in Cranbury, N.J., yesterday afternoon, lines of patrons snaked from the cash registers back through the aisles, with people snatching up shovels, firewood and salt. ''People go into a panic out here,'' said Mike Pain, a Foodtown customer-service representative. By early evening, the store was quiet, he said. ''People are all afraid to get on the roads.'' At Hunter Mountain ski resort in the Catskills, the phone rang steadily yesterday, as hopeful skiers tried to secure rooms for last night, to beat the snow and be on the slopes early today. By late afternoon, all the rooms in all 24 hotels in the area were booked, said Jessica Mahnken, a sales operator at the resort. ''This is what we bank our business on,'' she said. ''It's not like we're in need of it, but too much can't be too bad.'' Before yesterday, this year's snowfall in New York City had totaled exactly 22 inches, a whopping 18 1/2 inches more than all of last winter. Still, this is mild compared to seven years ago, when more than 75 inches of snow fell, Mr. Miner said. ''People have forgotten how winter can happen,'' he said. ''This is definitely harsh by new New York standards.''"
"MAYBE it has stopped (or never started) where you are, but when I glanced out my window yesterday afternoon, it was still snowing. I hadn't seen this much snow since the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo -- where it snowed for more than four days, where my roommate in one of the high-rise apartments in the Press Village would lift the dreary shade in the morning and peer through the ice-crusted window. ''It's still snowing,'' he would say. It snowed for about 100 consecutive hours. It snowed so much that halfway through the storm, the ''sneg,'' in the Serbo-Croatian language, was four feet deep in 5-degree temperatures near the restaurant roof atop Mount Bjelasnica, where the men's downhill was postponed twice. Too much sneg. And too much wind. ''If we'd sent the skiers up to the top,'' an Olympic official said, ''they'd have been blown off the mountain.'' Sarajevo was prepared for all that sneg. More than 400 plows had been imported from Austria, Italy and what was then West Germany. As the snow persisted, the plows never slept. Some of the drivers may have slept, but other drivers kept clearing the main and the mountain roads. Most of the Olympic events went on as scheduled. Before the 30-kilometer cross-country skiing on the Igman Plateau, somebody wondered who all this snow might favor. ''A reindeer,'' somebody else answered. But even a reindeer would have been trapped on Sarajevo's side streets, which had been ignored by the plows. The snow there was hip high, but the citizens waded through it just as New Yorkers did in tramping to the old Madison Square Garden on Dec. 26, 1947, after a record 26.4-inch snowfall. ''Pro Tennis Tonight,'' the marquee read. ''Riggs vs. Kramer.'' Two decades before open tournaments, pro tennis was a yearlong series of one-night stands between a champion and a challenger with a Garden premiere. Bobby Riggs was the champion, having dethroned Don Budge the year before. Jack Kramer, who had won Wimbledon and the United States Nationals, was the challenger. By nightfall, the midtown streets were clogged with abandoned cars and buses. Riggs and Kramer had to slog through the drifts from their hotel on Lexington Avenue to the Garden on Eighth Avenue. Theaters and restaurants were half empty, but 15,114 spectators watched Riggs win, 6-2, 10-8, 4-6, 6-4. Most had arrived by subway, others on skis and snowshoes that they stacked in the lobby. Some couldn't go home to get their tickets, but were let in after they phoned and learned the ticket locations. There were fewer than a thousand no-shows. Sometimes there's just too much snow in the seats. In 1982, an April storm postponed the Yankees' first four games at Yankee Stadium. When they finally played, they lost a Sunday doubleheader and never recovered. They finished fifth in the seven-team American League East with a 79-83 record, prompting Billy Martin's third term as manager. Snow can be a weapon, too. When a midweek storm wasn't shoveled completely from under Giants Stadium seats before the Giants' season finale in 1995, unthinking fans took out their frustration with a 5-11 team by throwing snowballs and iceballs, mostly at the visiting San Diego Chargers bench. The Chargers' equipment man, Sid Brooks, was knocked unconscious. Fifteen fans were injured, 15 were arrested, 175 were ejected and some had their season tickets revoked. One fan, photographed throwing a snowball, was fined $500 for improper behavior and assessed $150 for court costs. But snow can be the mother of invention. When a heavy snowfall and bitter cold moved the National Football League championship game, in 1932, from Wrigley Field to Chicago Stadium's indoor warmth, the Bears won, 9-0, defeating the Portsmouth (Ohio) Spartans, now the Detroit Lions, on Bronko Nagurski's 2-yard touchdown pass to Red Grange. On what was limited to an 80-yard field on leftover dirt from a recent circus, in order to create the appearance of a 100-yard field, each team was automatically penalized 20 yards whenever it crossed midfield. With the sidelines against the low walls, hashmarks were used for the first time to spot the ball and provide some running room to the short side of the field. What happened in Chicago Stadium would eventually evolve into all the football and baseball games on artificial surfaces in today's domed stadiums. Snow can take all the credit. Or all the blame. Sports of The Times"
"About the only good thing that thousands of frustrated rail commuters could say about yesterday's travel was that at least they did not pay for it. As New York slowly returned to work after the Washington's Birthday blizzard, morning trains into the city on some lines were so crowded that conductors could not squeeze through to collect fares. It was no better on the platforms. Exasperated travelers were forced to wait in the cold for hours as they watched packed trains roar past without stopping. And then when they finally got to board a steamy, overheated train, many found they had to stand all the way to work. ''Passengers in the doorway would tell people trying to get on the train that there was another one right behind them, which was the farthest thing from the truth,'' said Bill Moffatt, an office manager from Carmel, N.Y., who boarded a Metro-North train in Brewster. His normal hour-and-22-minute trip to Grand Central Terminal stretched to three hours. While buses ran with few problems, many commuters who flocked to trains thinking they were more reliable were left thinking they had been treated as second-class citizens. The railroads were so intent on not burning out their locomotives in the deep snow that they deliberately cut back the number of trains. ''Our objective was to serve the train instead of serving the customer, because if we hadn't, we literally wouldn't have any trains left tomorrow,'' said Daniel Brucker, a spokesman for the Metro-North Railroad. Railroad officials decided to run on a Sunday schedule, when meant that only about 135 of Metro-North's 550 trains were running yesterday. Mr. Brucker said the crowding was ''no surprise,'' nor were delays of 45 minutes or more that were caused as crowds of commuters boarded trains that finally stopped at their stations. But the objective, he said, was to avoid a repeat of the problems experienced during the 1996 snowstorm, when Metro-North ran many trains before the tracks were completely clear of snow. That damaged the equipment, leading to shortages that plagued the railroad long after the snow melted. The two feet of snow covering the electrified third rail after this latest storm tended to blow fuses, clog vents and cause the metal foot that rides within the rail to conduct electricity to short out and melt. Despite precautions, Mr. Brucker said, about a dozen trains were knocked out of service yesterday. Metro-North will return to a regular weekday schedule this morning, although shortages of cars will continue, a spokesman said. New Jersey Transit had its own problem keeping trains running on schedule. Hourlong delays were common, and the Midtown Direct trains into Pennsylvania Station had to be rerouted to Hoboken, where transit employees directed passengers to the ferry or the PATH train. Confusion and irritation piled up through the morning, but most commuters took the latest test of their fortitude in stride. ''We lived through 9/11 and the commuting problems associated with it,'' said Tony Hearsch, an insurance salesman from Hoboken. ''We can certainly handle a few days of snow cleanup.'' The Long Island Rail Road also struggled with a shortage of cars because operating in Monday's snow damaged some trains. The 5:35 a.m. train from Montauk finally pulled into Penn Station four hours late. New York City Transit managed to avoid the snow buildup problems, except where its lines run above ground. In Queens, A train service along the causeway from Howard Beach to Far Rockaway had to be suspended because of drifting snow on the tracks. Service on the G line was restored late yesterday. The entire system is expected to run close to normally today. STORM IN THE NORTHEAST: TRANSPORTATION"
"The Presidents' Day blizzard may have been only a glancing blow, but the storm will not help an economy that was already struggling to get back on its feet. The storm hurt restaurants and department stores, even if it did lift sales at supermarkets and home-improvement stores. It left some workers idle, depriving them of a day's pay, while it put others to work plowing, salting and cleaning up -- efforts that have added to the budget problems facing cities and states in the Northeast. And while the stock market had its second consecutive winning session yesterday, the blizzard's biggest effects on investors may be in the future. Any negative impact the storm has on February's economic activity will make it hard to divine the true health of the halting recovery, economists said, as Wall Street and the Federal Reserve study the retail sales, first-time claims for jobless benefits and other economic data in coming weeks. Storms rarely affect an economy enough to change its course, and analysts said yesterday that the dominant economic issues remained the hangover from the 1990's bubble and the lingering uncertainty from the possibility of a war in Iraq. But the blizzard, which moved out to the Atlantic yesterday after two days of snow from North Carolina to Nova Scotia, was large enough to hurt the finances of many businesses and workers. ''The bulk of the effects are temporary, unless you get serious damage like you do during an earthquake'' said Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. A blizzard, he said, ''tends to be disruptive in the very short term.'' Falling on a holiday for government agencies and many companies, the storm probably caused a smaller decline in hours worked and production than the Northeast's last large snowfall, in January 1996. But it is very likely to have damaged retail sales more because the Presidents' Day weekend is typically the busiest shopping period in the first three months of the year, said Burt Flickinger III, managing director of the Strategic Resource Group, a consulting firm in New York. ''It's a business bonanza for supermarkets,'' Mr. Flickinger said of the storm, adding that sales had nearly doubled at Pathmark stores two years ago in the days leading up to a predicted blizzard that never happened. ''Parents know kids will be stuck inside doing nothing but eating for a few days at a time,'' he said. ''But it's a disaster for retailers, for everyone from Saks to Starbucks.'' On Monday, all East Coast outlets of Filene's, Lord & Taylor, Hecht's and Strawbridge's north of the Carolinas closed, said Sharon Bateman, a spokeswoman for the retailers' parent company, May Department Stores. She said that she believed that all stores were open yesterday but that some employees had remained home and relatively few shoppers had ventured out. Some of May's stores are likely to extend discounts that were planned for Presidents' Day, she said. But many stores, particularly restaurants, will not recoup all the sales they would have made the last few days. In March 1993, when much of the eastern United States was hit by a late winter storm, retail sales fell almost 1 percent compared with the previous month, after adjustments for normal seasonal variations were taken into account, according to Economy.com, a research company in West Chester, Pa. It was the biggest decline for any month from 1992 to 1994. ''You lose some of that impulse- buying that would have taken place,'' said Carl Steidtmann, the chief economist at Deloitte Research. In 1996, retail sales also had their biggest decline of the year during the month of a blizzard -- January -- when the number of new vehicles sold declined almost 6 percent. Both retail and vehicle sales recovered the next month. Government agencies, many of them already cutting programs to close budget deficits, may have been hurt worst, economists said. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York estimated that clearing roads and sidewalks could cost $20 million, doubling the amount by which the city had already exceeded its budget for snow removal this winter. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com, said: ''Given the dire financial straits these cities are in, this is painful. They've got a lot of cleanup to do at a time when there's a lot of red ink.'' The tons of snow did create some winners besides supermarkets, though. Business at some hardware stores and outlets of Home Depot and Lowe's surged, as people rushed to buy winter equipment both before and after the snow fell. At a Family Discount store in Harrison, N.Y., a handwritten sign was taped to the front door yesterday afternoon telling shoppers that shovels and an ice-melting product were sold out. Although it arrived during a holiday weekend, the storm still cost some workers part of their usual workweek and paychecks at a time when wages are no longer keeping up with inflation in much of the country. On Monday, the number of temporary employees placed by the Manhattan office of Spherion Staffing, which fills clerical and administrative jobs for about 200 companies, was about 90 percent lower than it would have been in good weather, said Timothy Ihlefeld, a district director at Spherion. Staffing levels rose yesterday but had not returned to normal, he said. After some past blizzards, the number of claims for jobless benefits has dropped, with people temporarily unable to get to an unemployment office, and then increased in later weeks. Economists said they would be skeptical of any big movement in the numbers that will be released next week or the week after. ''If I saw a downtick, I would want to wait to assign it any significance,'' Mr. McKelvey said. But analysts do not expect the sharp swings in the broader employment statistics that came after the 1996 storm, when the Labor Department reported that the economy lost 87,000 jobs in January after having gained an average of 182,000 jobs in each of the previous six months. Unlike that blizzard, this week's storm happened after the government had conducted its monthly employment survey, economists said."
"It is not just graying snowdrifts and icy roads. The blizzard that barreled through the New York metropolitan region this week also left behind a sea of red ink for cash-poor local governments that must find the money to pay for carting away millions of tons of snow. The final tallies have yet to be made, but they are sure to be steep. New York City officials say that snowstorms cost around $1 million an inch -- an estimate about as trustworthy as the weather forecasts in farmer's almanacs. If that rate holds, and some budget experts say it could be too low, the storm would cost the city an additional $20 million at a time when only $3.2 million is left in its snow budget for the year. The heavy snowfall this winter is breaking budgets across the region just as local governments are already slashing services and, in some cases, raising taxes to cope with gaping budget deficits. Connecticut had only about $2.5 million left in its snow budget before the blizzard struck. New Jersey has now overspent its snow-removal budget by about $16 million -- money that will have to be offset by other cuts. Then there are the millions of dollars of lost tax revenue around the region. Sales-tax collections were hit hard when Presidents' Day sales were either sparsely attended, or nonexistent where stores closed. And the holiday drove up snow-removal costs. Nassau County paid twice the usual $7,000 an hour for its snow-clearing teams, and Connecticut's plow drivers, who usually earn $16 an hour, were paid $24 an hour because of the holiday. But officials agree that snow removal is nonnegotiable: the streets have to be clear for emergency vehicles, and life must go on. ''You don't worry about that,'' John J. Doherty, New York City's sanitation commissioner, said of the costs. ''You do the job, and we'll pay the bill later on.'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City and Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey said they hoped the federal government would help pay the costs. On Monday, Gov. George E. Pataki declared a snow emergency for the New York metropolitan area and a dozen other counties, the first step toward getting federal aid. Before the blizzard hit, a total of 15.7 inches of snow had fallen in Central Park so far this winter, and the city had spent $16.5 million on snow removal. The blizzard of 1996, which left 31 inches of snow in some parts of the city, cost $30.4 million to clean up, officials said. STORM IN THE NORTHEAST: COST"
"Monday was like a dress rehearsal, a holiday when millions of people could spend hours conquering snowdrifts or trying out shovels and snowblowers or humming the Sammy Cahn lyric (music by Jule Styne), Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow. On a no-pressure day, no problem. But that was Monday. Yesterday was when the biggest blizzard in seven years came face to face with a regular workday and got, at best, mixed reviews. The snowdrifts that looked so appealing on Monday became obstacles on the way to subway stations that were crowded because the trains were late. And despite efforts to clear the tracks, the commuter railroads in the New York region ran fewer trains than usual as officials tried to keep engines from straining and breaking down. Thousands of commuters were delayed. The snowplows were building ever-taller walls of snow, blocking driveways that had already been shoveled. Pedestrians do-si-do'ed to get past one another in the shovel-width walkways that had been carved out. The temperature was just warm enough to create lakes of slush at street corners. And thousands of cars buried in snow remained untouched by owners hoping for a good warm rain. They may not get it. Jeff Warner, a meteorologist with Pennsylvania State University, said that a prediction for rain on Friday was ''not so clear-cut as it once was.'' He said that the storm that is on the way could bring ice or more snow. The one that buried Central Park in 19.8 inches of snow on Monday was nasty, brutish and long; snow was still falling yesterday as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg stood in front of a snowplow in Brooklyn, and the National Weather Service said there could be flurries in eastern Long Island today. Mr. Bloomberg said that all of the city's primary streets and 92 percent of the secondary streets had been plowed at least once, and the goal was to plow every street by 6 p.m. last night -- all 6,300 miles' worth. ''Most of the streets are very passable,'' he said. Most, but not all. In Queens, many side streets were better suited to sleds than cars, as Robert Smalls, a telephone technician from Jackson Heights, discovered when he headed up an unplowed stretch of 65th Street near the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. ''We learn to live with it, but it's not right,'' he said. ''We pay taxes too.'' Monday (and the trace of snow the weather service recorded yesterday) made this the fourth snowiest winter in the last 35 years, and the 26th snowiest in the 133 winters that weather records have been kept for Central Park. And with a total of 26.1 inches, February 2003 has become the fourth-snowiest February on record, only two-tenths of an inch behind No. 3 (February 1926) and three-tenths of an inch behind No. 2 (February 1994). But the Monday storm did not pack the punch of the blizzard of 1978, the winter storm by which all other winter storms have been judged for 25 years. And by midday yesterday, Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey had lifted the state of emergency that had given the police the authority to close roads. Mr. McGreevey said he would ask the Federal Emergency Management Agency for funds to help cover the $13 million spent on clearing roads and cleaning up. The state had budgeted $14 million for snow removal for the winter, and has already spent more than $30 million. The three airports in the New York area -- La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark Liberty -- reopened yesterday. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reported delays through the day and said the airlines would need a couple of days to return to normal service. The storm's effects reached far. In Boston, the storm left 27.5 inches of snow, the largest amount in 110 years, and Baltimore-Washington International Airport went 2.5 days without a single arriving flight. On Tuesday, 13 poultry houses in several West Virginia counties collapsed under the snow's weight, killing 325,000 chickens and turkeys. At Philadelphia International Airport, hundreds of passengers have been stranded since Sunday, unable to get hotel rooms and sleeping with blankets and pillows supplied by the airport and dining on 200 boxes of doughnuts donated by Krispy Kreme. Three deaths in New York City were attributed to the storm. The police said that Henry Robinson, 67, of the Bronx died on Monday, apparently of carbon monoxide poisoning, while he was warming up his car on Webster Avenue in the Fordham section. Snow was blocking the tailpipe. A spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office said that an autopsy had been inconclusive and that tests were being done to check the carbon monoxide level in his bloodstream. A woman was found unconscious in a snowdrift in Tynan Street in Staten Island. The woman, identified as Cynthia Durapau, 52, was taken to Staten Island University Hospital, where she died, the police said. An autopsy was inconclusive, and the police said they were waiting for toxicology tests. And a 23-year-old man was found dead yesterday in his car on Claflin Avenue in the Kingsbridge Heights section of the Bronx, the police said. There were no signs of trauma to the body. The police said the man's keys were in his lap and that the car was not running when he was found. The authorities said the death appeared to be as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning. An autopsy is to be performed today. It was the city's sidewalks, not its streets, that were trouble spots yesterday. Some sidewalks were cleared by landlords or business owners who buried fire hydrants and parking meters in castoff snow. And people discovered that a habit they had picked up since the 1996 blizzard -- stopping in the middle of the sidewalk to talk on their cellphones -- blocked the shovel-width pathways that had been carved out. Those doing the carving (or the plowing) said the storm had been a test of endurance -- theirs, or their equipment's. ''This storm was easy to plow, just long,'' said Larry Labriola of White Plains, whose 15-plow fleet had been busy since 11 p.m. on Sunday. By yesterday, though, seven of his plows had broken down. Many people took the day off yesterday, and that had those who went to work complaining. ''New Jersey got a holiday,'' said David Seaman, who works for an insurance company in Manhattan. ''They just said the heck with it and went home.'' He said that only about a third of his colleagues made it it to their desks yesterday. STORM IN THE NORTHEAST: THE OVERVIEW"
"As always, Paul V. Sullivan emerged from his warm bed at 3:30 a.m., moving instinctively toward the bedroom window. He had gone to sleep thinking Buffalo would get, at most, three inches of snow overnight. He did a double-take. ''It looked like it was coming down pretty hard,'' he recalled. ''I knew there were six or seven inches of snow already.'' After pulling on his jeans, he grabbed a leftover chicken breast for breakfast and headed out into the dark that morning, Feb. 12. The snow whipped down his block at 40 miles an hour, and the temperature hovered around zero. Mr. Sullivan, an easygoing bear of a man known to friends as Sully, is responsible for keeping Buffalo in motion. He is the one charged with clearing snow from nearly 1,000 miles of streets, enabling residents to carry on with their lives and allowing businesses to stay open. And he has become the North American go-to guy for snow removal, fielding calls for advice from Toronto to Chicago, cities that are no strangers to snow. For New Yorkers who think they have slipped and skidded through a particularly snowy winter, consider this: Buffalo has had 97 inches of snow so far this season, to New York City's 42. But Buffalo, with a little help from 32,000 tons of road salt and a fleet of 60 snowplows, high lifts and blowers, has barely missed a beat. Nationwide, for cities with a population of 100,000 or more, Buffalo ranks No. 2 in average annual snowfall, just behind Syracuse. Yet Buffalo seems to have the snowier reputation. Meteorologists say that is because Buffalo, where the snowfall starts in October and lasts into April, tends to get bigger single storms that make the national news. (So even Floridians know the finer points of ''lake-effect snow,'' in which cold air gathers heat and moisture as it crosses over Lake Erie, leaving the results on Buffalo.) This winter has been somewhat atypical for Buffalo, with a steadier shroud of snow. Last winter was a standout, however. The city experienced its now-famous ''seven in seven'' snowfall: four feet on Christmas Eve, followed seven days later by three feet on New Year's Eve. There was so much snow that it was deeper than the height of the plows and could not be pushed aside. Rather, Mr. Sullivan's Division of Streets and Sanitation rented 350 dump trucks and 125 high lifts, and workers hoisted the snow up and out. Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University who grew up in Buffalo, said the city's reputation was made during the blizzard of 1977. Total snowfall in the January storm was a mere 12 inches, but winds racing up to 60 miles an hour lifted up the snow piled on a frozen Lake Erie and deposited it on the city. The result? Snowdrifts up to 25 feet. ''I was 6 years old, and we were off from school for two weeks,'' Mr. Miner recalled fondly. ''It completely shut the city down. Those images made the top of the national news, and people were seeing these pictures of two-story homes completely buried by snowdrifts. Johnny Carson came out with jokes that Buffalo still had snow in July.'' Mr. Sullivan, behind the wheel of his city-owned Chevy Tahoe last week, said that he was tired of Buffalo's being the butt of jokes. He thinks the city would be wise to extol, not excoriate, nature's bounty. ''We do get snow, but we can handle it,'' he said. ''A lot of people are negative about the snow. They say Buffalo is the snow capital of the world and that we lost four Super Bowls. But the snow can be a lot of fun.'' While Buffalo dodged the blizzard that roared up the East Coast this week, it was still shaking off the flakes from last week's gusty ministorm, which left seven inches of snow. Schools were closed Feb. 12 for only the second day all winter, and Fuhrmann Boulevard, which runs along Lake Erie, was shut for eight hours, as was an elevated downtown highway called the Skyway. By midmorning, the streets were largely cleared, but Mr. Sullivan still prowled the neighborhoods with his deputy commissioner, Nicholas F. Tomasulo, looking for trouble spots. Everywhere, it seemed, there was a waist-high berm of snow between sidewalk and street, and the new snow gave the city's complexion a fresh radiance. But a car had spun off the road near Fuhrmann Boulevard, and Fillmore Avenue still had a lumpy band of snow down its middle. ''Fillmore needs more work, huh, Nicky?'' Mr. Sullivan said. It is when the cold descends on Buffalo that Mr. Sullivan finds himself in the hot seat. Businesses take into account the city's ability to deal with the snow when deciding to relocate to Buffalo, and residents scrutinize their patch of the city with laserlike intensity. ''There's a lot of pressure on you,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''You get people who call to say their street isn't plowed, and then when you do plow the snow, they complain that it's blocking their driveway. Unfortunately, the snow has to go somewhere. It's a no-win.'' All of which helps explain his habitual predawn wake-up time. ''I like to be out there,'' he said. ''I don't want to sit in and wonder if it's getting done. I'll be out of a job.'' As his crews worked on Feb. 12, he placed a 6 a.m. phone call to his most important constituent, Mayor Anthony M. Masiello, whom he contacts whenever the snowfall exceeds six inches. Mr. Sullivan has worked for the Streets and Sanitation Division of the Department of Public Works, the city agency in charge of snow removal, for a quarter century. He hauled garbage and drove snowplows when he was still in college and gradually rose through the ranks to become the division's commissioner six years ago. His father drove a snowplow for the city for 38 years, and his maternal grandfather had worked as a mechanic for the same agency. ''It's kind of in your blood, you know?'' he said. Over the years, he has become something of an expert in the field. He always reminds his counterparts in other cities to press for a healthy snow-removal budget, noting that his salt budget alone is $800,000 a year: ''When it comes to snow, you can't skimp.'' Then there are the advance lessons, like sand in the country, salt in the city. ''Sand doesn't work in big cities because it can kill your sewers,'' he pointed out. ''It would clog them up and wreak havoc. And sand doesn't melt anything. It is only for traction.'' But salt has to be used with care. When the thermometer drops below 10 degrees, for example, salt loses its effectiveness; in those cases it should be limited to bridges and intersections. Likewise, if the snow accumulation is expected to top a foot, spreading salt is a wasted effort because it is quickly covered. In that case, salt works best as ballast on the back of the plow, Mr. Sullivan said, to help steady the vehicle. And Buffalo is always on the lookout for new solutions. Mr. Sullivan is now exploring adding a new de-icing product to his arsenal, a liquid that is supposedly better on snow and more environmentally friendly than salt. Good equipment is also crucial. When Mr. Sullivan spots one of his high-powered snow blowers or versatile wing plows in the field, he exhibits an almost avuncular pride. The same goes for his work force. ''I'd put our guys up against anybody,'' he said. ''I think they're the best around.''"
"REHABILITATING the reputations of the drivers of sport utility vehicles was not what hospitals in Washington and other East Coast cities had in mind this week when they sent out a plea to owners of four-wheel-drive behemoths. They just wanted the S.U.V. drivers to transport doctors, nurses and patients through streets knee-deep in snow. Nevertheless, for a few days drivers of gas-sucking Blazers and road-hogging Troopers sat a little higher in their high seats, riding to the rescue of medical professionals who had to get to work (or back home after pulling unexpected 16-hour shifts) and patients who needed critical treatments like chemotherapy or kidney dialysis. After a long, trying spell of being pilloried by Hollywood celebrities, ''What would Jesus drive'' activists and even their own ecologically sensitive children, S.U.V. owners were thrilled to pick up people they had never met for rides over the drifts in the comfort of heated leather passenger seats. Some 75 drivers of Hummers, Land Rovers and four-wheel-drive trucks kept Georgetown University Hospital staffed on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, after Washington-area hospitals ran announcements on television soliciting drivers. An army of 60 forged choked back roads and unplowed cul-de-sacs for Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. And hundreds more hit roadways unnavigable by ordinary cars in suburban Virginia and up the East Coast through Baltimore and Philadelphia. Glen Cardelino, who manages a Hummer dealership in Greenbelt, Md., and drives a top-of-the-line Hummer H1, found sweet vindication along with the satisfaction of helping out. His vehicle may get 14 miles to a gallon of gasoline, but, he said, ''We were there when you needed us.'' He has 30 inches of road clearance on his Hummer, and he drove all day Monday for Montgomery General Hospital in Olney, Md., delighted to exercise the rugged capabilities of his warrior wheels. ''The Hummer was just like a snowmobile,'' he said. ''I was driving back three-quarters of a mile off the main roads on streets that hadn't been touched'' -- in two feet of snow. And the Hummer performed. ''I never even spun a tire,'' Mr. Cardelino said. Certainly the S.U.V. volunteers were doing their bit for their communities. But many freely admitted there was a side benefit. With some communities restricting all road travel on Sunday and Monday to emergency trips, the only way to get out and do some four-wheeling in their snow-ready cars was to volunteer. Tony Tannouse, who builds racecars, drove for Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington and incidentally had fun testing his Blazer's chops, the way drivers do in the commercials. His Blazer sprayed arcs of snow for three days, as he drove 470 miles. ''I'm a thrill-seeker,'' he said. ''And I had nothing better to do.'' He drives an S.U.V. without shame ''because I like to know I can get from Point A to Point B regardless of the weather,'' he said. ''And this time I was helping people.'' As for the praise and gratitude raining down on his previously scorned vehicle, he said, ''I found it rather amusing.'' In Montgomery County, Md., according to Doug Duncan, the county executive, county workers were entirely occupied with clearing snow and answering emergency calls. It fell to citizens in their S.U.V.'s to drive residents to critical appointments and pick up prescription drugs. ''We could not have come close to handling all that without those volunteers,'' he said. He drove one himself, checking the progress of snow removal for four days in a county-owned Ford Explorer. Along the way he did some impromptu volunteering of his own. He picked up people trying to walk down the main drags to work. Gary Stephenson, a spokesman for Johns Hopkins University who lives in a Baltimore suburb, saw similar informal volunteering in his own neighborhood -- and also observed the resulting gratitude. ''It's funny how a week ago everyone hated S.U.V.'s, and now they're all heroes,'' he said. ''A guy in my neighborhood has a big old S.U.V., and he was picking up pizzas and toilet paper for everybody.'' One samaritan, Dave Parker, a Democratic political consultant, mused on the policy implications of the lesson the public was getting on the value of cars like his Chevrolet TrailBlazer. ''Should we blame S.U.V. owners when obviously these things have some merit -- they are useful tools at times like this?'' Mr. Parker asked. ''Or should we be calling for better fuel-efficiency standards?'' He was new in town -- he moved with his wife, Alice, from Montana to Dupont Circle in Washington two weeks ago -- but he was quick to volunteer. He transported nurses for Georgetown and said it felt good to know that his car had a proud place on city streets. Army Maj. Pedro Almeida landed at Andrews Air Force Base on Sunday morning after a 16-hour flight from Kuwait, where he had been, he said without elaboration, ''on business.'' On Monday he was out in his Toyota 4Runner, and his best moment, he said, was driving one Nigerian and one Ethiopian nurse from Silver Spring, Md., to Georgetown: he's a sub-Saharan Africa specialist. As a bonus, he added, ''four-wheeling in the snow is really fun, even in the city.'' For some, however, even riding to the rescue in a storm did not wash away the shame of driving a much-criticized car. Louis Wolf of Washington plied the Beltway in his Toyota Land Cruiser in the thick of Sunday's snowfall, carrying a cargo of doctors. But even as he did his lifesaving work, he remained acutely conscious of getting only 17 miles to the gallon. ''I still feel guilty,'' he said. Driving"
"Israeli children staked out positions along Jerusalem's main arteries, and their Palestinian counterparts commandeered rooftops above alleys in the Old City. They waited for the unsuspecting, and then cut loose -- with snowballs. A wide-ranging Middle East storm let fall almost a foot of slushy snow on Jerusalem, shutting schools, closing roads and temporarily infusing a tense city with the feel of a tranquil Alpine village. In a sun-drenched land, bursts of wet weather dampen the Mideast conflict and have sometimes proved a more effective antidote to violence than international diplomacy. On soggy days, Israeli security forces tend to have less interest in questioning Palestinians at checkpoints. Drenched clothes sap the motivation of Palestinian youths who might otherwise confront soldiers. ''You don't usually see people smiling like this,'' said Mike Harrington, a California resident, who along with his wife, Valerie, was visiting the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site. ''The atmosphere today is festive.'' Ultra-Orthodox Jews prayed at the stone wall, their black coats flecked with snowflakes, their traditional hats protected by plastic bags. A few hundred yards away, Palestinians wrapped their faces in scarves to guard against the cold as they headed toward the Dome of the Rock, its golden top partly covered by snow. Jerusalem officials recommended that residents stay home, and the city was largely deserted. Palm fronds sagged and tree branches snapped from the unaccustomed weight. The highway linking Tel Aviv to Jerusalem was shut for much of the day, and restricted to four-wheel-drive vehicles when it was open. Ambulances took 27 pregnant women to the hospital. In city parks, the day was filled with snowman-building contests and sledding. ''We've had so many war days,'' said Esty Ostreicher, a 17-year-old from Brooklyn who is studying for a year in Jerusalem. ''It's nice to have a snow day.'' But Hassan Abed, a Palestinian souvenir seller in the Old City, warned his five children to stay inside. Throwing snowballs, he said, could easily be mistaken for chucking stones. Still, plenty of other Palestinian youths were out and about. No deaths were reported today in Israel or the West Bank, where the snow fell. However, in the southern Gaza Strip, Palestinian witnesses and hospital officials said a 13-year-old boy was killed by Israeli Army fire in Rafah. The army said troops shot back after coming under Palestinian gunfire in the area. In a related development, a Turkish freighter in the Mediterranean Sea, off Israel's southern coastal town of Ashdod, broke away from its anchor during rough weather, drifted 10 miles from shore and sank. A tugboat rescued all 10 crewmen, who were brought to Israel, the army and emergency officials said. The heavy snow, mixed with sleet and rain, also hit parts of northern Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. The Beirut-Damascus highway was closed, and mudslides and overflowing rivers were reported in Lebanon. The rising Jordan River forced the closure of one crossing between Israel and Jordan. In Israel's lower lying coastal areas, the Kishon River overflowed, forcing zookeepers in the town of Qiryat Pivon to move animals to second-floor cages. Despite the problems, the thirsty region stands to benefit from what has been a wet winter after several dry ones."
"AS the residue of last week's snowstorm lingers in much of the Northeast, it may seem odd that inventors keep trying to perfect the manufacture of snow. But they do, and not just the stuff used at ski resorts. Two Swedish inventors, for instance, received a United States patent in December for a method of using artificial snow to kill bugs and other vermin. The two Swedes, Bertil Eliasson from Vallda and Per Hallberg from Savedalen, say the object of their invention is to freeze surfaces or spaces quickly so that ''harmful insects and other undesirable animals are cooled rapidly to kill them.'' In their patent, they write that carbon dioxide or another gas can be converted into a snow that will reach cold temperatures, stick easily and cover any surface thoroughly. The inventors say their method can be used to kill insects and other pests in the food industry, where insecticides are commonly used. ''Traditional poisons are expensive, require careful cleaning and cause lengthy operating shutdowns,'' they write in their patent. ''The poisons create an unsafe working environment and pose the risk of contamination of foodstuffs. Confined spaces are often difficult or impossible to treat.'' University studies in Sweden, the inventors say, have shown that ''rapid cooling is an effective way of killing insects.'' They recommend a decontamination recipe using five kilograms of carbon dioxide, an amount equivalent to ''the carbon dioxide exhaled by seven persons over a 24-hour period or produced by a car that is driven for approximately 20 kilometers.'' ''The method is thus nontoxic and environmentally friendly,'' they add. The snow produced can reach temperatures far below zero, the inventors said, which results in ''the 100 percent elimination of insect pests.'' The snow machine consists of a gas cylinder of carbon dioxide that then passes into one or more small chambers, each of which is larger than the previous one. The gas is crystallized, and as the snow moves through the increasingly bigger chambers, small particles of snow are able to clump together into larger flakes. As the snow accumulates, it cools further. The gas may also pass through obstructions in the chambers, like brush bristles, tubes, thin strips or a rotating mechanism, and these act to shape the snow. The resulting snow is then blown through a nozzle onto surfaces, or into spaces where it can expand. The device has ''a pistol grip for regulation of the gas flow.'' The inventors say the snow becomes thicker if it comes into contact with a larger surface area, and colder if it mixes with snow that has already been formed. Mr. Eliasson and Mr. Hallberg received patent 6,491,231. Three inventors from Japan working on behalf of Bridgestone have won an American patent for a method of testing snow tires on a turntable covered with artificial snow. In their patent, the three inventors -- Koichi Usami, Kouichi Fukuda and Kazuyuki Yamanoi, all from Tochigi -- write that testing tire performance in snow generally involves ''a test course on which snow has accumulated,'' which they say creates the problem that ''testing can be performed only during winter, when snow has fallen.'' They considered using artificial snow from pulverized ice or freezing sprayed water, they added, ''but the problem is that large-scale facilities are required for this method.'' That means building an indoor road, refrigerating it and then maintaining freezing air inside the building, they write in the patent. Such a system would use large quantities of water, which would have to be flushed through a sewer as waste when the tests were over. To get around the problems, the inventors designed a spinning turntable covered with ice and layers of snow for testing tires under various conditions. The device includes a turntable, a cooling element, an arm to support and rotate the tire, and a mechanism that presses the tire onto the artificial snow to simulate different loads applied to the tire. It also has brakes, so the tire's response to braking on snow can be measured. Their fake snow is made from a granular, water-absorbent material that expands when wet. They say it can be saved after each test session and used again. ''The artificial snow may be compressed and used,'' they write, giving it ''a state similar to that of an actual compressed snowy road.'' Adding more or less water will also change the snowy road conditions, they write. And they can reproduce driving conditions of acceleration, deceleration and slippage by tinkering with the tire speed. To keep the test tire from wearing a rut in the artificial snow, it is moved around the turntable, the inventors say. And the invention has a ''snowfall device,'' they added, so that an artificial snow layer can be created that closely mimics ''road surface conditions in which new snow has accumulated.'' Mr. Usami, Mr. Fukuda and Mr. Yamanoi received patent 6,408,689. In a more decorative vein, Philip Culver of Sarasota, Fla. -- where snowfall rarely if ever transforms the outdoors -- owns a patent for a device that sprinkles artificial snow over the branches of trees to give them the winter wonderland look. His invention includes a blower stationed at the base of a tree and a tube that extends upward along the trunk. Along the length of the tube, dome-shaped discs are positioned at intervals. Each of these discharges artificial snow. ''By this arrangement, artificial snow is uniformly dispersed to fall over the tree,'' Mr. Culver said. He received patent 5,098,084. Patents"
"His fenders were filled with it, his brakes covered in it: snow. But Fran√ßois Bureau just kept going. Not at the wheel of a four-wheel-drive monster that could bulldoze its way through any kind of weather. Mr. Bureau was whizzing down Varick Street toward the Holland Tunnel on a 21-speed racing bike. Yes, whizzing through the snow as if the 5.3 inches that the National Weather Service measured in Central Park had not happened. As if yesterday had not given February 2003 its own small place in the record books, with more snow than in five of the last six Februaries. ''This is nothing,'' Mr. Bureau, a bicycle messenger, said when he stopped for a pickup between Spring and Vandam Streets. ''If it would be colder, that would be a problem. The gears would freeze. If there would be a lot of salt or sand on the streets, that would damage the bike, but there's not. This is nothing.'' But nothing to Mr. Bureau was not nothing to everyone caught in a storm that had churned north from the Carolinas during the night. For yesterday was a study in contrasts, in how the rhythms of the city do not change much with snow -- and how the routines in the suburbs do. ''In the city, you just go on because somebody else is doing the shoveling and everybody's happy to go to work, especially in this economy,'' said James Murphy, a real estate executive who moved from the Upper West Side to Garden City, on Long Island, a couple of years ago. ''People out here pretend that they're grumpy. They're grumpy when they call into the office and say, 'I've been snowed in.' '' Which is what Mr. Murphy said he did yesterday, before he took his two sons sledding -- an expedition that was followed by more grumpiness. ''The kids get grumpy when they come back from the sledding and they're all wet,'' he said. ''I'll be grumpy Saturday when my back is out and I can't walk.'' For other people in snowbound suburbs, yesterday was the kind of day that brought back memories -- memories of when snow was something to appreciate instead of regret. Barnet Silver, a creative director who lives in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., recalled, ''When we first moved up here 16 years ago from the city, our reaction to the snowfalls was: 'Ahhh, isn't that nice?' '' As with so many love affairs gone sour, that initial infatuation gave way to something else -- snow removal, in this case. Now Mr. Silver says he has a love-hate relationship with wintry weather. He has brushed the snow off his car once too often. There was more snow to brush off in the suburbs than in the city. The National Weather Service measured 8 inches in New Canaan, Conn., and New City, N.Y.; 9 inches in West Milford, N.J.; 8.1 inches in Rutherford, N.J.; and 7 inches in Bridgeport, Conn.; Ridgewood, N.J.; and Montauk, N.Y. But as the snow waned and the temperature rose toward its high for the day (33 degrees at 3:59 p.m.), even meteorologists echoed Mr. Bureau, the bicycle messenger. ''It's nothing extraordinary; a typical winter storm,'' said Chris Johannesson, a meteorologist with Pennsylvania State University. ''Once people shovel out, it's really something that a couple of days from now won't be remembered.'' So yesterday's Currier and Ives moments did not last long. Neither did the midday snowball fights in SoHo Square, the triangle of a park along Avenue of the Americas between Spring and Dominick Streets. Ellen McCourt put on a white straw hat with a blue feather to walk her beagle five blocks to a friend's apartment. ''There's no bad weather; only bad clothing,'' she said. The dog-walkers were out. So were apartment- and job-hunters like Irene Fondreist, a lawyer who just moved to New York from San Francisco and was looking for a place to live and a place to work. ''I grew up in the Dolomites,'' she said, adding that when she lived in San Francisco, ''I missed the snow.'' She has been staying with an aunt here who told her, as aunts do, to take an umbrella when she went out yesterday. ''I argued, 'No, I want the snow,' '' Ms. Fondreist said. So the city kept going, battery-bunnylike, but some heard different drums. A peace protest was held as scheduled in Central Park -- 30 women ditched their clothes near the Bethesda Fountain and lay in the snow, spelling out words like ''War.'' ''I tried to do this twice before in the last three weeks,'' said Wendy Tremayne, an artist who organized the event. ''Every date I selected, it rained. This time, I said: 'You know what? It's just got to happen.'' She said that the protest involved ''about five minutes of laying in the snow and rearranging ourselves to get the word to be legible.'' Here is the obvious question: What was it like to lie in the snow? ''It burned,'' she said. No, she was not worried about frostbite. ''I didn't think five minutes in the snow would kill anybody. I was thinking about the Polar Bear Club'' -- the group that celebrates New Year's Day with a dip in the Atlantic off Coney Island. ''If they can go swimming in January,'' she said, ''we can handle five minutes in February.''"
"''An old-fashioned winter,'' you hear people saying, as though the snow were falling or the mercury dropping to the sound of sleigh bells. On a bright blowing day, the air fills almost invisibly with particles of snow that catch the sunlight. They look like the stars you see when you stand up too quickly. At night the moon coasts through the sky like the source of cold, shedding its beams on a frozen world that the sun is powerless to warm when it finally rises. All around us on this small farm we have the makings of a glacier. Every step we take compresses the snow a little more, and the pressure slowly turns the powder that fell a few days ago into ice, just the way it does in a real glacier. When spring comes, the last thing to melt will be the ski tracks along the fence line. When I walk across the pasture with my dog Badger, I can feel the history of this winter underfoot. Sometimes the snow-crust from the Christmas storm bears me up, so that I'm walking only calf-deep through the January snow, and sometimes I break all the way through to November. Badger skims across the snow, plowing it with his nose, until suddenly he holds a paw up, whimpering in the cold. Then we run for the house. In the chicken-yard, the hens and roosters stand first on one leg, then on another, as though they were marching in extreme slow motion down the alley between snowbanks. On a 12-below morning, I realize that the ones really having an old-fashioned winter are the animals. Snow falls on the horses and never melts because their hair is so thick. I imagine they look stoic, but I know that the idea of stoicism is all mine. Compared with a summer full of flies, a cold hard winter with plenty of hay and fresh water is nothing to complain about. The pigs spend most of the day bundled in their house. I have to remind myself that though they look naked, they are land-going whales, serene in a coat of blubber that keeps them warm through the worst of it. The animals see me come out of the house hooded, gaitered, mittened and balaclava-ed and wonder, what poor creature is this? VERLYN KLINKENBORG The Rural Life"
"At least one place in New York State has more business than it can handle and balmy weather all the time. The Cargill Salt Mine here, which is 2,400 feet under Cayuga Lake and where the temperature remains in the 70's year-round, is enjoying a financial bonanza as the snowy, bitter-cold winter forces state and local governments to regularly reorder the granular salt used for de-icing roads. The Cargill mine, America's deepest salt mine and one of its largest producers of road salt, is operating at a record pace, pulling eight tons a minute from the earth, to keep up with the tractor-trailers arriving at all hours to load up, often up to 70 an hour. ''Clients are calling to ask, 'How much do you have and how fast can we get it?' '' said Allen Bonnell, the bid manager for Cargill's de-icing accounts in North America. The mine's stockpiles around the state are depleted, as well as the 500,000-ton hoard it long kept next to Cayuga Lake. Mine officials say they are now ''selling from production,'' with crews working around the clock, seven days a week. Faced with one of its busiest winters ever, the mine cannot fill all its purchase orders, Mr. Bonnell said. ''We're at surge capacity and we've maximized what we can get out of the ground,'' Mr. Bonnell said. ''I'd love to have a bottomless pit, but we don't. People have started shaking supermarket salt on their sidewalks.'' For almost 85 years, miners here have tapped the rich supply of salt under Cayuga Lake. The seven bands of salt, each an average of 12 feet thick, running at various depths under the lake are remnants of a sea that dried up 400 million years ago. ''There's another 60 years' worth of supply left,'' said Mark Allaman, the mine superintendent, as he drove a salt-encrusted pickup truck through the mine one recent weekday. Like a strobe light, his headlights flicked across pillar after pillar of salt supporting excavated chambers. Visiting the Cargill mine is like a journey to another planet. As crews blast and haul away millions of tons of salt each year, the subaqueous mine has expanded underground, chamber by chamber, under the center of Cayuga Lake, here in the Finger Lakes region of central New York. At this depth, trucks and large machinery must be assembled down in the mine. There is a full repair shop, stockrooms and a huge sifting plant underground and a staff to work them. Equipped with earplugs, flashlight hard hats and emergency gas masks, miners take the six-minute ride down into the earth each day to a depth almost twice the height of the Empire State Building -- in a clanging steel carriage called a skip. They then ride on the back of a pickup truck through a maze of frosty salt pillars and pitch-black chambers of salt. It is a half-hour ride out to the farthest reaches of the mine. Everything, from loaders to lunchboxes, is caked with salt. On a recent weekday, with temperatures outside in the teens, miners in T-shirts used explosives to blast free hundreds of tons of salt at a time. In the Cargill mine, there are no picks and shovels. The miners often use remote-control devices to run many machines. Miners use the ''room and pillar'' method, blasting a portion of salt supply the size of a two-car garage. Pillars are left around the perimeter for support. At the end of each shift, the crew drills holes in the next room of salt and loads explosives to blast it. The next crew spends most of its shift scooping the roughly 500 tons of loosened salt with front-end loaders onto conveyor belts, where it goes to a sifting plant in the mine and is then lifted to the surface. With the operation here in high gear, the mine is loading more than 1,000 trucks a day, plus hundreds of rail cars that run on a special track through the mine property. More salt is bagged on site for retail sale. The current market price for road salt runs from $25 to $45 a ton, depending on transportation costs. Most of Cargill's salt is bought by government agencies throughout the Northeast, including highway and transportation departments in New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Vermont and New Hampshire. Cargill's largest clients are New York State's Office of General Services, which buys an average of 2.3 million tons a year for its Department of Transportation, and Pennsylvania, which orders about a million tons a year. Pennsylvania and New York's Thruway Authority have already depleted their supplies this winter and ordered more salt, Mr. Bonnell said. Salt prevents the formation of snow and ice by creating a brine with a lower freezing temperature. Salting roads gained popularity among highway departments in the 1930's and has grown over the years. Application technologies have advanced with computerized sensors and special software on trucks and saline solutions to prevent over-salting. On average, some 15 million tons of road salt are sold nationwide, said Richard L. Hanneman, president of the Salt Institute in Alexandria, Va. Last year 10.4 million tons were sold, he said, and this year's pace is already closer to that of 1996, when 20 million tons were sold. ''From what we're hearing, we've already sold as much salt so far this winter as all of last winter,'' Mr. Hanneman said. Salt was once big business in New York State, the country's third-largest producer, after Ohio and Louisiana. It is still a $1 billion industry here. The need to transport salt helped build the Erie Canal, and Syracuse was long known as the salt city. It still has the country's only salt museum. There are about 200 employees at the Cargill mine, many of them production miners whose fathers also mined here. Opened in 1919, the mine was family-owned and sold in 1970 to Cargill Inc., the international food company based in Wayzata, Minn. Keith L. Eggleston, regional climatologist at the Northeast Regional Climate Center at Cornell University, said that this winter had been unusually high in snowfalls and total inches of snow. In Syracuse, 107 inches have already fallen, almost as much as the average for an entire year, 121 inches, and more than the 34 inches recorded last winter. ''We've already had a whole winter's worth of snow, and we have February and March to go,'' Mr. Eggleston said."
"When it comes to snowfall, even a flurry is likely to provoke a blizzard of reporting. ''People love hearing about snow,'' said Nolan Doesken, a meteorologist at Colorado State University. But too often, he and other experts say, the nonstop coverage of winter weather masks a troubling decline in reliable snowfall statistics. ''The loss of snowfall data globally is a major concern,'' said Dr. Barry Goodison, a climatologist in Toronto. As chairman of a scientific steering group in the World Climate Research Program, Dr. Goodison depends on snowfall figures to help predict climate change. But too often, he said, the information he needs does not exist. In Russia, social and economic shifts have undermined data collection across that vast and snowy country, Dr. Goodison said. In the United States, after the National Weather Service closed many of its weather stations in the 1990's, snowfall measurements were left in the hands of untrained workers. And training is critical, meteorologists say. ''Of the basic weather parameters, snowfall is the most difficult to measure,'' said Mr. Doesken, the author of a book and a videotape used to teach measuring techniques. The basic method -- sticking a ruler in the snow -- has not changed much in hundreds of years. But decisions have to be made about where and when to measure. ''If one person's measuring on the roof of his car and another on a snowboard,'' Mr. Doesken said, referring to a surface that is cleared of snow at regular intervals, ''you've got a problem,'' Mr. Doesken said. Snow reaching the ground can melt, turn to vapor or compress snow that fell before it. If two people measure the same snowfall, one every hour and the other at the end of the storm, they ''would come up with different numbers,'' he added. Even the precise location matters. Dr. David J. Nolan, a meteorologist at the University of Miami, said: ''Drifting has to be accounted for. And think about walking around in the backyard with a ruler. You can get large variations just from the effects of a tree.'' For much of the 20th century, the Weather Service operated hundreds of stations where meteorologists used established measurement techniques. In the 1990's, the service closed nearly half of its 300 stations, including offices in Stratford, Conn.; Newark; and Wilmington, Del. ''When you look at the historical weather records,'' said Michael Schlacter, chief meteorologist at Weather 2000, a forecasting company in New York, ''you see this beautiful tally of snowfall going back 40 years or more. And then in 1997 or '98, the data just stop.'' Some Weather Service offices were consolidated. The station at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y., on Long Island, now controls data collection for the entire New York metropolitan region, which once had six stations. The meteorologist in charge of the office, Michael E. Wyllie, conceded that the approach left ''gaps in snowfall measurement.'' At the major airports, he said, Federal Aviation Administration employees have continued to take readings, ''although they're not required to.'' In Central Park, zookeepers, not meteorologists, take the measurements, according to Mr. Wyllie, who said he had fought to keep the lone weather station in Manhattan open. Mr. Schlacter said the last 12 measurements Central Park that totaled at least three inches ended in ''point zero'' or ''point five.'' ''It makes you very suspicious that they're just rounding,'' he said. ''We're working with them,'' Mr. Wyllie said about the zookeepers. ''We're doing the best we can.'' At airports, meteorologists said, F.A.A. employees may not take measurements unless airport operations are affected. As a result, small snowfalls are reported as ''traces'' rather than actual amounts. Heavier snow may not be measured until it stops falling, meaning that there is no information about the progress of a storm. ''And that isn't much use if you're trying to compare a snowfall of 1889 with a snowfall of 2003,'' Mr. Doesken. ''The numbers you hear on the news are typically from helpful spotters, who love to call in their reports. The media have learned to tap into these people. But they aren't the kind of measurements that can go into the official record.'' Paul Knight, who is the state climatologist for Pennsylvania and a meteorologist at Penn State University, which has provided weather information to The New York Times for 17 years, agreed. ''The quality of snow reports has certainly diminished,'' he said. ''The Weather Service can't go sending out their personnel to Ronkonkoma and Passaic to see if the volunteers are measuring the snow correctly.'' The loss of information has real-world effects on fields like insurance and litigation. Mark Kramer, a meteorologist who often appears as an expert witness, said he testified in a slip-and-fall case in which the amount of snow on the ground was an issue. Mr. Kramer said he could not find snowfall figures for Manhattan for several weeks before the accident. ''The judge,'' he said, ''was stunned.'' The Weather Service moved heavily into automation in the 90's, replacing many staffed stations with electronic devices. ''For most weather variables, that's a story with a happy ending,'' Mr. Schlacter said. ''When it comes to temperature and humidity, readings were no longer impacted by human error. And you could get the information on the Web in real time.'' But that is not true of snowfall. ''As easy as it seems,'' Mr. Doesken said, ''science is not producing a quick answer to the question of snowfall measurement.'' In Canada, where vast amounts of snow collect in remote areas, hundreds of electronic measurement devices are used. Typically, a device sends an ultrasonic pulse from the top of a pole to the ground. The time it takes for the pulse to return, adjusted according to temperature, indicates snow depth. ''I have one of them right here,'' Mr. Doesken said. ''It works once the snowfall has stopped and the snow on the ground has a firm, solid surface. If snow is still fluttering down or if the surface is fluffy, it's almost useless.'' Dr. Goodison works for the Meteorological Service of Canada, where he helped develop the device. Although it is imperfect, he said, it fills a need in a country where snow often falls in remote areas. Over time, he said, scientists will develop formulas that will allow them to come up with accurate snowfall numbers from imperfect readings. For an automated approach to work, in Mr. Schlacter's view, it will have to simulate the actions of a human measurer. Such a device, he said, could take decades to develop. In the meantime, scientists hope to rely on more trained measurers, including volunteers. In places like Stratford, where the Weather Service closed its office in the 90's, ''volunteers have kept the snowfall records going,'' Mr. Wyllie said. ''We've been lucky in the New York City area,'' he said, ''to have good people who have continued to take the measurements for us.''"
"The roof of a Toys 'R' Us store collapsed this morning under the weight of snow and heavy rain, injuring nine people, apparently none seriously. Fire and rescue squads used thermal imaging equipment and police dogs to search for any sign of people buried at the center of the wreckage. The search was called off at 7 p.m. No missing person reports were filed, the police said, and Fire Chief Ronald Blackwell said he was ''cautiously optimistic'' that no bodies would be found. Cranes were to be brought in on Sunday. The Prince George's County police estimated that about 25 customers and 10 employees were inside the one-story building when 60 to 70 percent of its flat roof caved in about 11:45 a.m. Officials said the domino pattern of the collapse may have helped people escape. The injured, including a 3-year-old, were taken to hospitals. The roof collapsed as torrential rains soaked the Washington area. As the mounds of snow began to melt, there were reports of several roofs collapsing or being at risk. In Virginia, the roof of a school in Herndon fell in. There were no students inside. A Wal-Mart in Leesburg, Va., and a shopping center in Prince George's County were evacuated as a precaution. In West Virginia, heavy rain and rapid snow melting caused flooding that forced some residents out of their homes. In eastern Kentucky, two people were killed and 10 others injured by high winds. At the Toys 'R' Us, customers described fleeing the building. ''It fell really fast,'' said Clara Guyton, 54, who was shopping with her daughter and her grandchildren, ages 1 and 7. ''We were running and the roof followed us. We looked up and the beams were falling near us. The lights were falling. The toys were going all over the place, and then it all stopped.'' Her daughter, Doretea Burton, 29, said, ''For a moment, I thought we were going to die.''"
"Last Wednesday morning, the Queens borough president, Helen M. Marshall, took Sanitation Commissioner John J. Doherty aside to thank him for the bang-up job his snow removal crews had done after the big blizzard. Such a scene would have been almost unimaginable in February 1969. Back then, a similar storm blanketed the city, and Queens officials famously blasted Mayor John V. Lindsay, accusing him of ignoring their borough. One City Council member urged a grand jury investigation. Responding to the criticism, the mayor toured the messy streets, only to be heckled by residents. ''Just you try to get elected again,'' one woman shouted. Lindsay did get elected, barely, after losing the Republican primary and running on the Liberal line. Many people believe that snow nearly did him in. Or, more accurately, what the snow represented. ''In the large scheme of things, whether your street is plowed today or tomorrow is not that big of a deal compared to whether your kids get educated,'' said Vincent J. Cannato, author of ''The Ungovernable City: John Lindsay and His Struggle to Save New York'' (Basic Books, 2001). ''But it was hugely symbolic. It reinforced the belief among a lot of people that the mayor didn't care about their neighborhoods, that he was Manhattan-centric and was emphasizing poor neighborhoods over middle-class ones.'' It was a dramatic, cautionary tale about the politics of snow. Last week at least, there was no danger of a repeat performance. Even the winding back roads in neighborhoods like Little Neck, near the Nassau County border, were cleared quickly. By midweek, the Sanitation Department announced that all streets in the five boroughs had been plowed. Gary Holz, 79, who has lived on dead-end Beech Knoll Avenue in Little Neck for nearly half a century, was pleased. ''Can't complain,'' he said. ''We're obviously not a primary or even secondary road, but they came Monday.'' In 1969, Mr. Holz recalled, his road did not see a snowplow for days. ''Nobody came,'' he said. ''There was a family who lived up the block who had two or three sons, and the father and sons did it manually.'' This time, plows appeared in Little Neck before the first snow fell, according to Joseph Giacoia, a retired tool and die maker who lives on 41st Drive. And a sanitation worker who lives on nearby Browvale Lane said it was the first time he did not have to call his own department to get his street cleared. Community Board 11, which includes Little Neck, received only two complaints, far fewer than after a much lighter storm earlier this winter. In Forest Hills, a scene evoked the vast gulf between past and present. On Jewel Avenue, where Mayor Lindsay was photographed trudging through an unplowed mess in 1969, two lanes of traffic sped along, heading toward Grand Central Parkway. SETH KUGEL NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK SNOW"
"A week that started snowy and turned balmy pulled off a torrential culmination yesterday, as heavy rains pounded the New York area and flooded the region throughout the day. The downpour, which totaled about 1.5 inches according to the National Weather Service, caused major flooding in roads and homes. Authorities issued flash-flood warnings yesterday, cautioning that heavy rain could combine with melting snow and drains blocked by snow to cause flooding. New York City had hired hundreds of day laborers last week to help clear snow from street drains, and many residents had volunteered to clear drains on their own. But it was the rain that wound up getting rid of much of the snow on regional roadways and streets. Traffic was slowed because of flooding on many major highways throughout the region. In New York City, they included the Bruckner Expressway, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and the Belt Parkway. In New Jersey, Route 1 in Rahway was closed. Highway closings in Westchester included the Bronx River Parkway and the Saw Mill River Parkway. The flooding washed road salt into a manhole in the Kensington section of Brooklyn yesterday afternoon, causing a short circuit in an electrical transformer, the authorities said. Two Con Edison workers suffered burns. A resulting power failure affected the Palm Gardens Nursing Home, and about 30 of its residents who depend on respirators were taken by ambulance to local hospitals. No New York City roadways were closed, and there were no major traffic problems in the city, said Frank McCarton, a spokesman for the Office of Emergency Management. ''There was sporadic ponding and flooding on some major arteries, but we got lucky that it did not come during a weekday rush hour,'' he said. The receding snow did leave city streets pocked with potholes, from modest divots to crater-sized holes marked with trash cans to alert drivers. A spokesman for the city's Department of Transportation, Tom Cocola, said that the rain created a severe rash of potholes on F.D.R. Drive, the Cross Bronx Expressway and the Belt Parkway. Mr. Cocola said last night that the department would conduct a ''pothole blitz'' today, sending out 30 work crews to fix potholes. Some 500 city residents called a city hot line yesterday to complain about sinks and toilets backing up, said a spokesman for the city's Department of Environmental Protection, Charles G. Sturcken. Also, he said, the department received about 250 complaints about street and basement flooding ''mostly from homeowners in low-lying communities in Brooklyn and Queens.'' The heavy rains and melting snow flooded the city's sewer system. Mr. Sturcken said that water and waste flowing into the city's 6,300 miles of sewer lines was too much for the city's 14 wastewater treatment plants to process. The plants can handle a maximum of about 3.6 billion gallons per day. The overflow spilled through about 500 outlet points throughout the city into waterways. The situation, caused by severe rains, happens several times a year, Mr. Sturcken said. In Broad Channel, a Queens community surrounded by Jamaica Bay and prone to flooding, many residents volunteered to clear snow from street drains to avoid high water. At least one resident said he was taking no chances. Joseph Carey, a retired subway motorman, fashioned a 2-foot-high barrier out of plywood and boat caulking that he attached to his front door to stave off floodwaters. The contraption worked, so Mr. Carey, 88, did not have to start up his basement pump, or the backup pump he connects to his boat battery."
"Beautiful and Edible Q. Are there tricks to growing runner beans? An English friend says they're delicious, but the scarlet runners I plant for the hummingbirds aren't nearly as good as the regular kind. I've tried picking them young, but that didn't help. A. Runner beans (Phaseolus coccineus) don't need tricks, but they are different from snap or string beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), the ones mostly commonly grown in the United States, and they need different conditions to produce tasty pods. Vulgaris beans thrive in hot summers and can tolerate mild drought as long as they have enough moisture after they start flowering. Runner beans need warmth for the seeds to germinate but do not like it hot. Once they get going, they prefer cool roots, and they need more water and richer soil than their cousins. They also need help with pollination. Vulgaris beans fertilize themselves, but if you want to eat runner beans, the more bees, the better. Of course, crop size doesn't matter if all you want is a giant vine dripping with panicles of gorgeous flowers. Scarlet is the best known color, but peach, pink and white are also possibilities, and all attract butterflies as well as hummingbirds. Bright-flowered runners are usually marketed as dual purpose: enjoy the blossoms, then eat the beans. But as you have discovered, their pods aren't always the tastiest. If you want to find out why your friend says runner beans are delicious, try a white flowered variety like Desir√©e or White Dutch. Sources for runner beans include Thompson & Morgan, (800) 274-7333, www.thompson-morgan.com; Vermont Bean Seed Company, (800) 349-1071, www.vermontbean.com. After the Snowstorms Q. The last few storms have given our country house four feet of heavy, wet snow, and animals have eaten all the bark around everything above the snow line. Will my roses and climbing hydrangeas survive? A. Survival depends on what has happened below the snow line and on what happens between now and spring -- those hungry animals are still out there. Nourishment flows up from the roots through the green inner bark, which means that everything above the ring of eaten bark will die. The plant itself will be fine (just shorter) as long as there are sound branches and intact bark below the ring. But, unfortunately, the lowest ring of eaten bark may be very low indeed. Snow provides cover for mice and voles, which are avid bark eaters. So shoveling is your first step, regardless. If you see a ring of damage at ground level, all is lost. If the lower regions have been spared, exposing the plant bases will help protect them, and you can also keep animals at bay with a bitter, repellent spray. But if the pressure is extreme, you will need to build protective cages. Use concrete reinforcing wire, wrapped with tight-mesh hardware cloth. Be sure to anchor a skirt of the cloth against the ground, to discourage under-fence raids and to stabilize the cages.

"The biggest blizzard in seven years buried the New York region and much of the Northeast in one to two feet of snow yesterday, disrupting air and highway travel and raising chest-high drifts on the wintry landscapes of 10 states. But for millions home on Presidents' Day, it offered a holiday break, not hardships. Driven by winds that gusted to 55 miles an hour, the storm -- a smudge 750 miles wide on satellite photos and a blinding whiteout on the ground -- churned onto the Eastern Seaboard on Sunday and moved from Virginia and Washington up the coast yesterday, at times dropping one to two inches an hour on New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. It closed airports, obliterated flight schedules and stranded thousands of travelers. It caused countless traffic accidents, halted or delayed buses and trains, prompted emergency declarations in six states and brought life without sleds, skis or S.U.V.'s to a virtual standstill in Washington, Baltimore, Atlantic City, Philadelphia, New York, Boston and the rest of the Northeast Corridor. Two deaths in the metropolitan area were attributed to the storm. In the Bronx, a 67-year-old man died of carbon monoxide poisoning while he was warming up his car; the tailpipe was blocked with snow, the police said. In New Jersey, a 23-year-old man was killed and four people were injured in the collapse of a snow-laden roof at a Job Corps Academy training center in Edison, but no one was hurt when the roof of a Rite Aid drug store in Clifton fell in. Two people in West Virginia and 10 more in the Midwest were killed in earlier deaths attributed to the storm. But there was beauty as well as treachery in the storm. In woodlands and parks, on anonymous suburban streets, in cities where skylines vanished, the storm was a dream world of blowing snow and muffled sound: The distant scrape of plows and shovels, a child's shout in the wind, gave the day an old-fashioned feel, tumultuous yet private, the stillness of a small town, silent in winter. The timely arrival of the storm on Presidents' Day weekend, and on a week when New York City public schools are on recess, diminished its impact significantly. Many businesses were closed for the holiday, most theaters were dark, nonemergency government services were shut down, there were no mail deliveries, and millions of people had the day off to frolic in the drifts or labor with shovels and snowblowers. It was hardly the Storm of the Century, although its bluster brought out the expansiveness of television forecasters. But the National Weather Service and meteorologists at Pennsylvania State University called it the biggest since the blizzard of Jan. 7-8, 1996, which left two to three feet of snow over the Northeast. In New York City, the snow in Central Park by evening had reached a depth of 19.8 inches, just short of the 1996 total of 20.2 inches, but well behind the record of 26.4 inches, set in the blizzard of Dec. 26-27 in 1947. Elsewhere in the city, the totals were higher. In Queens, 25.6 inches at Kennedy International Airport and 28 in Howard Beach eclipsed the 1996 snows. All last winter, only 3.5 inches of snow fell in New York City, and yesterday's snowfall almost doubled the 25 inches recorded earlier this winter. On Long Island, Farmingdale reported 23.5 inches, while New Hyde Park had 21 and North Babylon in Suffolk County had 22. Sparkill in Rockland County reported 24.3 inches. Evening totals in Connecticut included 19 inches at Darien and 18 at New Canaan. In New Jersey, West Milford had 26 inches, Little Egg Harbor 24 inches, West Caldwell 23.2 inches, Newark Liberty International Airport 21.8 inches, Ringwood in Passaic County 19, and Williamstown in Gloucester County 22. Elsewhere, Philadelphia had 19 inches, Washington 15 and the Baltimore-Washington Airport a record 26.6 inches. Garrett County, in Maryland, reported the storm's highest total, a whopping 44 inches. There were no major power failures in the New York area, apparently because the snow was relatively dry and did not stick to -- and bring down -- trees and power lines. But the storm brought major power failures elsewhere. In West Virginia, 95,000 residents were without electricity and were told that power would not be restored before tomorrow. More than 130,000 homes in Virginia, the Carolinas and Ohio were left without power earlier. For thousands of air travelers, it was virtually impossible to escape the storm. Airports in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Windsor Locks, Conn., were closed, along with La Guardia Airport in New York. Kennedy and Newark Airports remained open, but extensive flight cancellations made the distinction almost meaningless. Subways were running with some disruptions, including on elevated portions, but service on some city bus lines was suspended and bus service was halted in and out of the Port Authority Bus Terminal. New Jersey Transit suspended all bus service, but ran trains with scattered delays. A spokesman said New Jersey Transit would operate what it called an enhanced Saturday schedule today, adding trains on the Northeast Corridor, Montclair-Boonton, Pascack Valley and Port Jervis lines. Midtown Direct will continue to run to Hoboken instead of Pennsylvania Station, the line said. Metro-North switched from a holiday schedule to a more limited Sunday schedule, using diesels instead of electric locomotives on its Hudson, Harlem and New Haven lines. Diesels run better in deep snow. Late yesterday, Metro-North cut service further, running trains out of Grand Central Terminal only every two hours. Dan Brucker, a spokesman, said Metro-North planned to run a Sunday schedule again today, instead of its regular weekday rush-hour service. ''We believe a lot of our customers will be shoveling themselves out tomorrow morning,'' Mr. Brucker said. ''If they all show up, we'll make adjustments.'' The Long Island Rail Road reported scattered delays of 15 to 30 minutes, and suspended service on its main line between Ronkonkoma and Greenport, providing shuttle buses for riders. The line said it expected to operate its regular morning rush service this morning, although riders were cautioned to expect delays. In the Northeast Corridor, Amtrak canceled much of its service, but ran empty trains to keep snow from blocking the tracks. Despite the storm, the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels and the George Washington Bridge reported no backups, but traffic was light and slow-moving everywhere, and speed limits were cut to 25 miles an hour on the bridges linking Staten Island and New Jersey. Speeds on the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway also were reduced. Major highways were open in Connecticut, with 632 plows from the State Department of Transportation, supplemented by 242 contractors, clearing the roadways. Many of Connecticut's largest shopping malls, including West Farms, in Farmington, closed shortly after noon. The blizzard even prompted the Mount Southington Ski Resort, south of Hartford, to shut down for the day. Gov. George E. Pataki declared a snow emergency for the New York metropolitan area and a dozen other counties hit by the storm. The step mobilized seven state agencies to provide assistance. In New York City, 2,700 sanitation workers used 1,500 plows and 350 salt spreaders and cleared the major arteries in the five boroughs. But most side streets were choked with drifts late yesterday, and were probably not going to be open by today when the workweek resumes. ''It's very pretty,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said as the storm swirled outside a sanitation garage on the West Side of Manhattan where he met reporters. ''It's also very inconvenient and very expensive.'' The mayor said that the city had already spent more than the $19 million that had been budgeted for snow removal this year, and that this storm could cost $20 million more -- $1 million for every inch of snow. Mr. Bloomberg warned that the city's 6,000 miles of side streets would probably not be plowed until tomorrow, and advised New Yorkers to take mass transit wherever possible. ''It's going to be a rough commute,'' he added. ''But everyone will get there.'' Few cars were moving on New York streets, and most of the parked cars were trapped behind silvery walls of snow shoved aside by the plows. With sidewalks all but impassable under the drifts, New Yorkers who ventured out took to the roadways, and some found city parks irresistible. ''You feel like you're in a wonderland,'' Ann Gorewitz said as she and her husband, Steve Barcan, strolled through Central Park, surrounded by studies in black and white: rock outcroppings jutting up in the drifts, silhouettes of darkly skeletal trees trimmed with white lace. ''It's just really special.'' The main street of Maplewood, N.J., was special for Leighann Narum-Miller, who grew up in Wisconsin. She was skiing up the barely plowed thoroughfare, and her friend, Jutta Gassner-Snyder, who is from Austria, felt right at home walking briskly alongside her. Nearby, Bill and Susan Gyves were pulling their 3-year-old daughter, Katie, on a sled. ''It's a great day,'' Mr. Gyves said. ''Tomorrow's the challenge.'' STORM IN THE NORTHEAST: OVERVIEW"
"Washington does not need Presidents' Day as a reason to shut down. It needs just an inch or two of snow. Blanket it with a monster snowstorm and people start asking, How long will it take the most powerful city in the most powerful nation on earth to dig out? As long as 60 hours, Mayor Anthony A. Williams announced today, demonstrating yet again that a city of ''Southern efficiency and Northern charm -- John F. Kennedy's famous insult -- views a snowstorm as an insurmountable act of God. Washington, after all, has trouble with rain. President Bush, setting the cocooning mood of the capital, canceled a Presidents' Day speech at the National Museum of American History, around the corner from the White House, a distance of less than half a mile. The reason, White House aides said, was not that the president had any fear of venturing out in his 14-car motorcade, but that the museum itself had closed. Mr. Bush did keep a scheduled meeting in the Oval Office with President Vaira Vike-Freiberga of Latvia. She had to be ferried to the White House gates in a fleet of four-wheel-drive Chevy Suburbans. Mr. Bush also made time to take his dogs for a romp in the snow. ''It's still the White House and there's a lot of activity, but for at least a day it was quieter than normal,'' said Adam Levine, a White House spokesman, who like a small cadre of other presidential aides who came to work today had left the West Wing by 4 p.m. The storm was another reminder that the world's largest enterprise, the United States government, is in fact made up of human beings with walkways to shovel and cars to dig out. Although the State Department issued statements today on the latest developments on Iraq, the NATO agreement on Turkey and the three Americans believed kidnapped by Colombian rebels, projecting the image of a powerful institution hard at work, all were in truth compiled by a snowed-in press duty officer who had papers all over her house and who spent the day trying to reach other homebound officials. ''I had to get a lot of people who were out scraping their cars,'' she said. Certain extremities of the military were affected, too, even though Air Force F-15's and F-16's continued to fly patrols over the capital, as they have since the alert for a terrorist attack was raised on Feb. 7, and truck-mounted antiaircraft batteries remained positioned throughout the region. ''The ground-based equipment should not be impacted other than their crews having to keep their toes warm,'' said Maj. Barry Venable of the North American Aerospace Defense Command. But a capital that has become accustomed to what seems like an inexorable march toward war mostly took a welcome day off from the tensions, with the snow silencing the usual tough words. People moved on cross-country skis down Massachusetts Avenue, the normally busy thoroughfare that stretches from Capitol Hill to the Maryland suburbs, and took children to build snow tunnels in neighborhood parks. ''It was a complete escape day,'' said Carolyn Deaver, who runs a nonprofit program to help women through cancer treatments and who is married to a former Reagan White House adviser, Michael K. Deaver. ''I took a nap. I read a book. I went cross-country skiing, and I ate M&M's.'' Although the snow stopped here by midday, Washington, not wanting to rush into things, decided it was best that people spend another day at home. The Office of Personal Management announced this afternoon that the federal government would be closed on Tuesday, as it was on Monday for the Presidents' Day holiday. The decision, officials said, would help reduce commuting problems on local roads, many of them still unplowed and impassable after nearly two feet of snow. Mayor Williams, who announced that he himself would be out working with road crews to clear the streets, said that the storm had already put the city way over its snow budget for the year and that some other city services may have to be cut. The other problem, he said, was finding a place to put the snow. ''You can't just dump it in the river,'' he said. ''That's an environmental hazard.'' Schools, which were closed on Monday, will also be closed on Tuesday, causing shouts of joy among children who found the drifts too deep for good sledding today but anticipated speedier, packed-down snow on Tuesday. Another Washingtonian who rejoiced in the snow was John O'Leary, a former United States ambassador to Chile who was the mayor of Portland, Me., in the 1980's, when Portland typically got one or two major snowstorms a year. ''The difference was, we had a fleet of trucks that would have taken care of the streets by now,'' Mr. O'Leary said. ''But that's not a complaint. There is almost a 19th-century charm about being able to go out and be with your dog in the middle of the street.'' Snow in Washington, he said, ''really is quite beautiful.'' STORM IN THE NORTHEAST: WASHINGTON MEMO"
"There's one thing to be said for the powerful snowstorm that brought the East Coast to a near-standstill over the past two days. It restored us all to the immediacy of the moment. This was an event that had nothing to do with human will. All the official resolutions and declarations in the world would not have abated a single flake of falling snow. Humans have always been disposed to read something symbolic into the grand cataclysms that nature brings, and in the hush that fell over New York, Washington and the other cities on the Eastern Seaboard you could hear an extraordinary peace, as if the storm had momentarily overshadowed the war against terrorism and the escalating crisis with Iraq. The run on duct tape and plastic sheeting stopped temporarily, replaced by a run on snow blowers and ice salt. That free-floating dread was replaced by free-floating flurries. The explanation of this storm has a classic regionalism to it. A stream of warm, wet Southern air ran up against a cold dome of Arctic air stationed over the Northeast. The storm cut a broad swath through the mid-Atlantic states, creating one disaster area after another, threatening to break some of the East's most venerable records. Washington was especially hard hit. In New York, a city that often seems impervious to weather, the snow gained the upper hand yesterday. Airports shut down, trains were delayed and side streets that went unplowed were all but impassable to cars. Pedestrians, finding snow-clogged sidewalks hard to navigate, walked boldly down the middle of main thoroughfares like Broadway and Fifth Avenue, only occasionally scampering to the side as a lone bus or snowplow approached. Cross-country skiers, liberated by the national holiday, flocked to Central Park, where they found an eerily peaceful Siberian landscape. Absent a snow-removal miracle, the wintry scene, including chest-high drifts, promises to give way to huge traffic snarls and other transportation nightmares as the workweek begins today. New Yorkers will be watching closely to see how quickly Mayor Michael Bloomberg can get the city back up and running -- including the outer boroughs, where snow clearing has not always been a high priority for City Hall. Along with all the other things that a storm like this delivers -- inconvenience to most, severe risk to some, death to a few -- it also delivers a strangely uplifting sense that life might just be lived at a different pace. Sweeping up from the South, shutting down malls and monuments and entire cities, this storm came upon us like a vestige of the past, as if the rising winds were somehow blowing us back in time. Compared with the need to stay warm and dry, the other necessities of life seem less pressing. Suddenly there is nowhere to get to and no getting there fast. All the urgencies that crowd the calendar look entirely postpone-able. The storm brought an almost meditative calm, time to slow down and remember, once again, that human life can be lived only within the frame of nature. It was natural to watch this storm with mixed emotions. The plowing bill will wreak havoc on already wrecked city budgets. Undoing the damage in the worst-hit areas will take days. And yet there's something oddly gratifying and pleasantly distracting about the snow. After all, it would be nice to think that the historic times we live in were made historic by nothing more than a major blizzard."
"Measuring snowfall, it turns out, is not unlike financial accounting. Both are official-looking collections of numbers trying to capture something dynamic. And both are often characterized by a desire to inflate the numbers. ''The general public assumes that we all know what we are doing, and we all do it the same way,'' said Nolan Doesken, a snow expert at Colorado State University. Not so, he said. Even as the Washington area emerges out of its thick layer of snow, measuring two feet deep in some areas, this weekend's blizzard, although deserving, will not rank in the top five snowstorms on record. That is because the official snowfall measurements for Washington are taken at Reagan National Airport, where a mere 16 or so inches were recorded. Sleet, spurred by the Potomac River, compressed much of the flaky snow that fell at Reagan National, causing a lower measure there than at other nearby locations. So how do they take snowfall measurements at the airport? ''They use a complicated system of radar telemetry where they bounce things off of satellites,'' said Andy Woodcock, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. Really? ''No,'' he acknowledged. ''They put a ruler in the snow.'' STORM IN THE NORTHEAST"
"On another day, the blizzard would have been a disaster, or at least an annoying interruption. But on a day that was already a holiday, it was more of a lark, a break from terror alerts, budget crises and the dreary routine of a February in New York City. Blessed paralysis enveloped a city of hustlers and strivers. With public schools closed for the week and many businesses closed for the holiday, many New Yorkers already had the day off. And many others got early morning phone calls canceling work or other obligations, leaving them to contemplate the snowflakes. The snowstorm, the worst to hit the city in seven years, proclaimed a day off with enough authority to clear any workaholic's conscience. It was as if a taut city suddenly and collectively uttered the word, ''Decaf.'' Orange-alert jitters seemed muffled in the snow. The usual Times Square hordes dissolved into gentle groups. There were no lines at movie theaters, lunchtime counters or laundries. A walk to the corner turned into an athletic activity. Plastic sleds were used for hauling provisions. Neighbors had time to be neighborly again, shoveling out parking spaces and pushing each other's cars -- even the occasional taxicab -- out of snow drifts. ''Everyone seems a little nicer today,'' Police Officer Derek Tricoli said as he stood in Times Square yesterday afternoon. ''I think it takes their mind off everything that's been going on the past week.'' It was a slow day on the beat. Officer Tricoli, 24, a rookie officer in the Midtown South Precinct, was answering questions and obliging tourists' requests to pose for pictures. ''The only thing I heard over the radio is some guy who got his finger chopped off in a snow blower,'' he said. Even the city government, mired in a budget crisis measured in the billions of dollars, got a bit of a reprieve. At a news conference, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg jokingly suggested that it was not pure luck that brought the storm on a holiday. The lack of workday traffic saved the city time and money in clearing streets. ''If I could take credit for arranging it, I'd like to,'' he said. Many people started the day like Roxie Seigle, 21, who woke up at 6 a.m. in Harlem and began dressing for work. Then Ms. Seigle, who cuts hair at a downtown salon, looked out the window at the blinding snowstorm. ''I thought, 'How am I ever going to get downtown in all this?' '' she said. As it happened, she was saved by the ring of her cellphone: the shop would not be open. She immediately planned a day of snow play, movies and laundry. The snow kept falling, and by noon, many streets and avenues were barely cleared. Along many thoroughfares, it was left to the masses to beat paths through the snow. Many streets, even in busy Manhattan neighborhoods, had such light traffic that they essentially belonged to pedestrians picking their way along tire tracks. Many sidewalks remained uncleared throughout the day. Brave pioneers would blaze narrow footpaths through the untamed snow. After the first trail was established, others followed, and with not much room, people would pass each other by giving priority to the old, the young or the heavier of boot. ''Most people will never see snow like this in New York City,'' said Louis P. Christie, 31, a State Senate aide from Herkimer County who was visiting Manhattan for a few days. Caught without a hat, he clutched a plastic shopping bag over his head and watched as Midtown store employees shoveled snow to the street, only to have plows push it back onto the curb. ''Upstate we get a lot more snow, but we got more places to put it,'' he said. He was not the only visitor with time on his hands. Amid the serious trudgers in boots and ski suits was Christopher Marx, jogging in nothing but a light sweatsuit and sneakers. Mr. Marx, 39, an accountant visiting on business from Barrington, R.I., had covered three miles on an indoor treadmill at his hotel gym. ''Finally, I said, 'I just can't stay inside anymore,'' he said. ''Temperature-wise, it's great out here. Surface-wise, I wish I had skis.'' A prime playing spot was a snowy hill in Riverside Park near 108th Street, where the children arrived early in the morning, carrying store-bought sleds and makeshift luges fashioned from garbage can lids, food trays or cardboard. ''The big kids like it too,'' said Barbara Shelley, a 60-year-old resident of the Upper West Side who has been sledding there for 30 years. Mostly she uses the same orange plastic sled she once bought for her daughter, who outgrew it. But even on the hill, some reminders remained of that other city of appointments and important phone calls. Mary Catherine Savard, 26, and a friend had a big blue plastic toboggan that still had a $21.99 price tag. Ms. Savard said she decided to play hooky from work because her boss was out of town. ''It feels like Vermont out here,'' she said. Suddenly, her cellphone rang. ''Oh no,'' she said, wincing. ''It's my boss.'' Stepping away from the hoots and hollers on the hill, she took the call. STORM IN THE NORTHEAST: SCENE"
"The business of cleaning up after a blizzard has been a political barometer since Mayor John Lindsay met his frigid Waterloo on the snow-clogged streets of Queens in February 1969. Now, advances in forecasting storms and removing snow -- backed by a battalion of sanitation workers, plows and salters -- have left Mayor Michael Bloomberg feeling so good about the job being done that he appeared Tuesday on ''Late Night With David Letterman,'' touting the top 10 reasons to love the snow. Strangely, the list did not include the invigorating exercise that comes with digging out a car buried under a mound of plowed snow. Still, the mayor had reason to feel chipper about the city's response to one of the worst storms in New York history. According to the Department of Sanitation, all 6,300 miles of city streets were visited at least once by a plow by late Tuesday, which would make good the mayor's carefully worded promise, a pledge that wisely did not include any guarantee that the streets would all be passable. By poking fun at the city's dilemma, the mayor was taking his own advice -- that residents cope by relaxing and lightening up. That may be easier if the weather also chills, so to speak. Warming temperatures, nice as they sound, would make floods of those snow hills and bring a whole new set of problems, including streets of ice with the inevitable return to freezing temperatures. As he toured the city in the snow, Mr. Bloomberg was spared Mr. Lindsay's reception: boos and shouted predictions -- eerily accurate -- that his political future would have the shelf life of a snowball much farther south. At least for the moment, this mayor seems to be winning a round with Mother Nature, and the Presidents' Day snowstorm is not likely to become a top 10 reason for replacing him."
"As temperatures rose yesterday, New York suddenly became a city of uncharted lakes, ponds and yawning canyons of slush. Brave explorers hopped, skipped and inched their way across the treacherous terrain, sometimes soaking a shoe or trouser leg. At intersections, in particular, a certain amount of negotiation, etiquette and athleticism came into play. And there seemed to be a need for invention. ''They should put a catapult here and fling us across,'' said Sarah Bonano, 18, a student standing at 42nd Street and the Avenue of the Americas. At that same corner, a businessman flexed his feet, hiked up his trousers and walked on the heels of his wingtips through a table-size puddle of slush. Downtown, at Houston Street and the Bowery, a slacker with a mustard yellow muffler shuffled right through a similarly large puddle, buoyed by nothing but his indifference. At Second Avenue and 96th Street, a woman tried to ford a yawning lake of cold, gray water that people had attempted to bridge with cardboard boxes, flattened plastic water jugs and cinder blocks. The woman, Eunice Dilone, made it, but watched as her 6-year-old son, Anthony Franco, plunged his foot ankle deep into the water. ''It's impossible to cross the street without getting totally soaked,'' said Ms. Dilone, 26, a hospital administrator. The Feb. 17 blizzard stopped some subway, bus and train lines, and left cars around the city and the region buried. The first day it was fun, the second day, it was annoying. But on the third day, as temperatures got well above freezing, one group was the hardest hit: those who, for one reason or another, had to walk somewhere in New York City. Melting, but still giant, walls of snow created single-file corridors from curb to street, forcing walkers to brush awkwardly and a little too familiarly against each other, or to wait their turn. Extraordinary topographical challenges created pedestrian activity that was hardly pedestrian. After filing through the walls of snow, those on foot were confronted with slushy puddles that turned crossings into steeplechase jumps or obstacle courses -- with impatient walkers lining up behind them, waiting for an opening. ''I've seen a lot of 'me first' attitudes, but I've also seen people working together, giving each other advice on strategy and the good spots to cross,'' said Robert Mullaney, 26, a medical student. Depending upon who and where you were, a routine walk became an exercise in frustration, athleticism, teamwork or all three. At least, New Yorkers were finally kept from jaywalking mid-block by the snowdrifts that lined the sidewalks. ''The snow was nice for about a day,'' said Ms. Dilone, ''but look at the aftermath. It's not pretty anymore. It's just brown and gross and disgusting.'' So she took to carrying Anthony, all 55 pounds of him, across the puddles and slush. ''Thank God I have long legs,'' she said. ''But I can't even go to work looking professional. I have to wear these big clunky boots.'' Many larger puddles were bridged with ad hoc materials. Plywood was piled on Ninth Avenue, cardboard boxes on Eighth, wooden packing crates on Sixth and plastic water bottles on Second. Around noon, a young man approached a puddle at Sixth Avenue and 42nd Street and took a seemingly effortless huge leap -- and cleared the entire body of water. The man, David R. L. Brown, 20, a student from Ardsley, N.Y., confessed that he had practice in a related activity. ''I was a long jumper in high school,'' he said. ''It's a great day for me. I've come out of retirement.'' But most people around Mr. Brown were not so cheery, and he smiled as one pedestrian after another cursed the puddle. ''This is a fast city,'' he said, ''and all this snow and slush just slows everybody down.'' Though the city had no catapults yesterday, it was trying to clear away the mess. The city's Sanitation Department hired 573 ''emergency laborers'' on Tuesday, and more yesterday, to help remove snow from crosswalks, bus stops and catch basins, said the department's commissioner, John J. Doherty. At a news conference yesterday, Mr. Doherty urged business owners and landlords to dig out drains and catch basins to prevent flooding over the next several days. He said that the city cleared the streets ''in record-breaking time.'' Just about every city street was plowed, he said, ''probably in around 19 or 20 hours, which is about half the time it took us after the '96 snowstorm.'' Leoni Dalmau, 22, a dog walker in Greenwich Village, said the mess was not exactly bringing out the best in New Yorkers. The large puddles forced her to carry clients' dogs across, she said, a time-consuming task when you are walking three dogs at the same time. ''All day, I'm getting people behind me, rushing me,'' she said. ''One guy yelled, 'Walk in the street, lady.' I'm like, 'I don't think so.' '' At a puddle at Sixth Avenue and 14th Street yesterday, Ms. Dalmau picked up and carried Jackson, a Boston terrier, but Charlie, a standard poodle, was too big, and had to walk himself across. In the Mott Haven section of the Bronx, people have no time for such niceties, said Lilly Maestre, 26, a loan processor. Ms. Maestre revealed her secret puddle-traversing weapons: a new pair of Timberland boots. ''You can't tiptoe around,'' she said. ''You just got to lace up your Tims and stomp right through.'' That was not an option for Jeffrey Acea, a 50-year-old painter who gets around by wheelchair. After shopping for groceries, Mr. Acea was crossing Willis Avenue at 137th Street and became stuck in a snowy patch in the street. A supermarket employee rushed over and pushed him through a large puddle onto the sidewalk. ''People are especially nice today because they know you're not going to ask them every day,'' Mr. Acea said."
"During the blizzard Monday afternoon, workers tried to keep the practice bubble next to Giants Stadium from collapsing. They climbed to the top and tried shoveling the snow away. No luck. They went inside and tried to maintain the air pressure, which supports the bubble. But the bubble started to sag more, and the workers did the next smart thing: they got out. Minutes later, the bubble collapsed. ''The real culprit was the wind,'' Jim DeBosh, a spokesman for the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, said yesterday. ''It was coming from the north. So the north side of the roof had no snow because the wind had blown it all to the south side. That caused unequal pressure and led to the collapse. ''It wasn't like it was 'run for your life.' It didn't implode. It was a gradual process.'' The sports authority owns and maintains the Meadowlands sports facilities in East Rutherford, N.J., including the bubble, which is also used by the MetroStars. When functioning, the bubble is inflated by compressed air, and metal around the top keeps it from blowing away. The bubble was built in 1994 for $2 million, including foundation work. ''To repair it,'' DeBosh said, ''it will cost us $200,000 to $250,000. We're looking right now at whether to repair it or replace it. If we decide to repair it, it will take a couple of weeks.'' The timing is not ideal because the Giants will start their off-season program next month. Ernie Accorsi, their general manager, seemed certain a bubble would be ready. ''It went down in 1996,'' he said, ''and it was back up in a couple of weeks. And I don't think it's a safety issue because it didn't collapse all at once.'' About 25 miles south of the Meadowlands, the bubble at Rutgers University's athletic complex in Piscataway, N.J., also collapsed in the snowstorm. No one was injured there, either. Most sports teams at Rutgers use the bubble, built in 1985 for $1.5 million. But the university was closed at the time and no one was in it. Even permanent roofs of sports arenas are endangered by bad weather. At the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Hartford in 1978, ice and snow led to the collapse of the roof, which crashed 85 feet to the floor. No one was inside at the time. The facility, home to the N.H.L.'s Whalers at the time, was shut down. The Whalers then played home games in Springfield, Mass., 28 miles north. Two years later, the facility reopened with 4,000 additional seats, bringing its capacity to 16,000. In 1997, the hockey team moved to Charlotte, N.C., but the arena, now known as the Hartford Civic Center, sells out for Connecticut men's and women's basketball games. PRO FOOTBALL"
"The stress of Boston's record snowfall may have been too much for at least one person this week. Stephen C. Meninno, 49, had apparently shoveled out his driveway in Framingham early Tuesday morning, only to have a snow plow operator drive by and block it again with a small mountain of snow from the street. According to the police, Mr. Meninno became so angry that he yelled at the driver and attacked him with a shovel. Mr. Meninno has pleaded not guilty to charges of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace. This morning, a talk radio show here was trying to use the Meninno episode to coin a new phenomenon, ''snow rage.'' But the truth is that even though Boston's 27.5 inches registered as the biggest snowfall since records started being kept in 1892, most people seemed to take the winter avalanche pretty much in stride. Sure, the snow, which fell for more than 20 straight hours beginning Monday morning, crippled traffic everywhere, and the Massachusetts Turnpike lowered its speed limit to 40 miles an hour. Sure, many stores and shopping malls were shut just when they were banking on customers trolling their Presidents' Day sales. And, of course, traffic at Logan International Airport was paralyzed, marooning thousands of people on a prime winter vacation week. But in terms of panic and hysteria, this storm was a nonstarter. ''I went out in the snowstorm,'' said Lia Tota, 55, of Woburn. ''I went to the mall. It wasn't packed, but there were some people there. I had my oil changed at the Jiffy Lube at the Burlington Mall, and there was no one ahead of me. I bought a phone, which I needed, and I just had to drive very carefully home.'' That kind of confidence grows partly out of Boston's long memory, which has etched into it the Blizzard of 1978. Although this week's storm technically surpassed 1978's snowfall by four-tenths of an inch, it was nothing compared with the mayhem and destruction that walloped the city 25 years ago. ''I was here during '78 and we were crippled,'' said Joseph Casazza, Boston's public works commissioner. ''But anyone who talks of the blizzard of '78 and this one -- you can't talk about those two storms in the same breath. They don't even belong in the same sentence.'' In 1978, savage coastal winds and thick, slushy snow had the city in a virtual lockdown for days and led to more than 50 deaths. People were trapped in their cars, and houses were destroyed. By contrast, said Charlie Foley, a spokesman for the National Weather Service in Taunton, Mass., Monday's snowfall was much lighter and fluffier, making it easy to plow and shovel. It also did not weigh down power lines or tree limbs, so there were few power blackouts. Also, this was not a fast-blowing snowstorm, he said, so ''it didn't have the coastal flooding, duration, or hurricane winds.'' What is more, the storm kept up a measured pace, allowing snowplows to clear roads before too much accumulated, and then to clear roads again throughout the day. ''It was well anticipated,'' Mr. Foley said. ''It was a big storm that affected Washington, Philadelphia and New York. We knew it was on target, and it hit when we were ready.'' Perhaps most important, the storm arrived on a holiday, so schools were closed and many workers were already planning to stay home. That made for lighter traffic and helped cleanup crews work faster. For most people, the damage was confined to a snow-buried car or an impassable driveway. ''I think it was a situation where we caught every break on it,'' said Peter Judge, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. ''The timing -- it was on a holiday and a school vacation. You didn't have to deal with school buses or early dismissals. People are on vacation, they were either in New Hampshire or down in Disney, so they were out of the mix completely. I think the only unhappy people are the kids who are saying it's another storm that we're not going to have the day off.'' Mr. Judge said two deaths were attributed to the storm here: one person died in a car accident and a man operating a small snow plow drove through a grate and plunged 20 feet into a hole in the street. Other states suffered more. The snow has been blamed for a total of 53 deaths, including 12 in Pennsylvania, 7 in West Virginia, 4 in New York and 8 in Maryland, including 4 children sitting in stranded cars who died from carbon monoxide poisoning. In Massachusetts, municipal budgets have been hit hard. In a winter already blanketed with snow, many communities had already exceeded their snow removal budgets. Boston's mayor, Thomas M. Menino, said that, in order to save money, piles of snow will be left where they are, unless they are blocking school bus stops. The state had already spent $55 million to remove snow this fiscal year, more than triple the $16.5 million the state had budgeted for snow removal, said Jon Carlisle, spokesman for the Massachusetts Transportation Department. Mr. Carlisle said Monday's storm, which made this February the snowiest month on record here, cost $7 million. Gov. Mitt Romney did not declare a state of emergency, as several other states did, because no municipalities requested state help, said Mr. Judge, of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. Mr. Judge said the governor was still evaluating whether to ask for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency on behalf of some counties with extreme snow accumulations. Today, as temperatures rose into the 40's, the authorities were worried that rapid melting could cause floods and that rain expected later in the week could add to the snow and cause roof collapses. But Mr. Carlisle said he expected that ''the snow pack will absorb most of the rainfall'' and ''we're not looking for any flooding problems at present, in the short term.'' He added, ''I think this will be noted as a good New England northeaster with lots of snow, but that's about it.''"
"One day last fall, Gary Donaldson looked up and the recalcitrant heavens over his Hackettstown farm finally let loose. One drop at first, followed by sheets of rain. Day after day it continued, bringing precious water to a region withered by drought for the better part of three years. ''It was like it just started raining and wouldn't stop,'' recalled Mr. Donaldson, 46, who grows melons, sweet potatoes and Jersey tomatoes with his brother Greg about 50 miles west of Manhattan. ''Just watching the weather patterns, you could see things were changing.'' After an autumn of heavy rains followed by a snowy winter, meteorologists and climate experts have quietly confirmed what many in the parched Northeast have come to believe: the drought that has gripped the region since the late 1990's is effectively over. In fact, meteorologists are now saying that all that snow could cause spring flooding. And the drought is not just over in the New York area. Climatologists have said that thanks to heavy snow -- as much as twice the typical accumulations in some areas -- water levels in rivers and reservoirs have risen all along the Eastern Seaboard. Weather experts caution, however, that the drought, driven by an enduring El Ni√±o warming pattern over the past few years, persists throughout the West and lingers in pockets of New England. Nevertheless, climatologists say, much of the worst is over. Even before the recent pronouncement of its demise, the drought had lost much of its sting in the Middle Atlantic. In October, New York City ended its drought emergency. A few weeks later, Westchester County followed suit. And at the start of the year, New Jersey did the same. However, municipal and state governments sometimes make such decisions using a different standard than the one applied by meteorologists. Some government bodies lifted their drought emergencies based on promising measurements of water in rivers and reservoirs, even though in many cases, deeper groundwater and aquifer levels remained low. And although some surface water storage areas have been topped off since the beginning of the year, climatologists had lingering concerns about levels in aquifers and underground wells. Recent measurements, however, have shown that in some places, groundwater and aquifer levels have reached their highest point in several years. Those measures coincide with a steep increase in water storage at regional reservoirs. For example, at the beginning of last year, storage at the Delaware River Basin, whose tributaries supply some of New York City's reservoirs, stood at around 70 billion gallons, according to figures from the basin commission. However, measurements taken Friday indicate that the basin had 254 billion gallons. ''Reservoirs are pretty full, everything's in good shape,'' said Michael Evans, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Binghamton, N.Y. Mr. Evans said the robust water levels could be traced to the same factor that closed schools, clogged highways and blocked driveways this winter. ''While our precipitation was not too far from normal, snowfalls were well above normal,'' he said. New York City, which receives about 21 inches of snow in a typical winter, was covered with 45.3 inches this winter, he said. The Catskills, which get 80 to 150 inches, got 100 to 200 this winter. Newark, typically dusted by 24.1 inches, was blanketed this winter by 47.9. And Mr. Evans said all of this snow might end up having some unpleasant side effects. ''We have deep snowpack in the Appalachians, which is melting,'' he said. ''So we may have some flooding.'' Delaware River Basin Commission officials have issued some of the same warnings after reporting that the snowpack in some portions of the basin -- which includes parts of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware -- were at their highest levels in seven years. For Gary Donaldson, who in a couple of weeks will begin the most promising planting season in years, the basin numbers and the flood warnings are just proof of the capriciousness and whim of the weather patterns that he and other farmers rely on for their livelihood. ''It's funny,'' he said, ''it's like you get it all at once or you don't get it at all.''"
"A late winter snowstorm shut down large parts of Colorado and Wyoming today, with airports and roads closed as several feet of snow piled up over 48 hours. The storm left thousands of residents and businesses without power, closed schools, stranded travelers on roads and at airports and trapped skiers at a resort when the road could not be cleared. The storm hit along the densely populated Front Range, the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, and brought anywhere from a few inches to seven feet of snow. Despite the disruptions, the snow was welcomed because the area is in a drought. ''This is something that is badly needed,'' said Dan Hopkins, the spokesman for Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado. ''The governor is certainly, as are most Coloradans, glad that the heavy, wet snow is here. But it would've been just as effective for the drought to have a few small storms. With Mother Nature you take what you get, though.'' Last year was the driest in Denver since 1872, according to the National Weather Service. Governor Owens and Gov. Dave Freudenthal of Wyoming worked from their homes during the storm, as state, city and county offices were closed. The Colorado Legislature was unable to convene for its regular session for the first time ever. Mail delivery was suspended in Denver and other parts of Colorado, as well as in Cheyenne, Wyo. A Colorado state emergency operations center, largely set up to deal with terrorist threats, was opened on Tuesday night, and Governor Owens authorized the use of the National Guard to assist the Colorado State Patrol with stranded motorists. Interstate highways running east and west from Denver were closed because of ice and snow as well as a threat of avalanches. Several cities restricted travel to emergency personnel. At least two deaths appeared to be related to the storm, both in Colorado. A 65-year-old man was found dead in his pickup truck, and a man was killed when his snowmobile and a snow plow collided. The Denver International Airport was closed, with more than 4,000 travelers stranded there. Cots were made available for 850 of them while the remainder turned to makeshift beds. People were first herded from the airport's three concourses to the main terminal, but sometime before sunrise today some people heard the heavy, wet snow rip the terminal's signature tentlike roof. While the exterior tear was huge, the snow did not break through the ceiling. As a precaution, passengers were then evacuated from the main terminal to the ticketing areas and back on to the concourses before vans were able to get through and take some people to nearby hotels. Roofs on some Denver businesses collapsed under the weight of the snow, which collected to more than two feet in many parts of the city. But when a record-breaking snowfall meets a historical drought during spring break, the news is not all bad. ''Basically, this is exactly what was needed,'' said Nolan Doesken, a climatologist with Colorado State University's Climate Center in Fort Collins. ''Even if this doesn't make a big dent in our reservoirs, it means our trees, our flower beds, are watered for weeks now and nobody will be turning on a hose.'' Mr. Doesken -- who was snowed in at his home in Fort Collins today and answering what he described as ''a zillion e-mails'' -- said the snow was providing as much as 30 percent to 40 percent of the annual precipitation in some places. For example, 32 inches of snow in Fort Collins had created 5.2 inches of moisture, the most moisture from a single snowstorm in 114 years."
"I'd like to be able to hear the snow melting. A low whoosh would do, a sigh from the snowpack as it yields to the sun's insistence. I'd settle for a barely audible scream. The sound the snowmelt actually makes -- the aural glittering of a dozen rills -- is too diverting to suit my darker emotional needs. At our place, we had more than a hundred inches of snow this winter. It's not enough that it should melt. It should suffer as it melts. For the past five months I've walked back and forth to the barn over a sheet of polar ice. Now it groans as I step along it. I enjoy the sound. I send the horses up and down the ice sheet, then follow in the tractor. I'm breaking up winter while I have the chance. Reports say that robins are near and that red-winged blackbirds have arrived only a few miles south of us. The snowdrops and aconites lurk somewhere under the sagging drifts. On Sunday -- the first really warm day in months -- the rain gauge in one of the garden beds suddenly reappeared, as if reporting for work. Plowed snow still stands in mountains all around us, looking more geographical than ever now, an Earth in miniature. Since the big melt began last weekend, those alps have broken apart into separate island continents, divided by a rising sea of gravel and matted sod. I admire the animals we live with -- their keenness, their toughness, the completeness of their sense of self. But what I really admire right now is their ability to shed. I stood in the barnyard the other evening with Nell, the mustang. She eats half of what the other horses do and hairs up twice as thick. She's been rolling fretfully in the snow for the past couple of weeks. When I scratched her back I came away with whole fistfuls of red horsehair. By the time I finished scratching, the ground around her looked like the linoleum under a draft-induction-barber's chair. She squared her legs so I could really lean into the work. This is a time of year that makes me wish I could slough my skin entire, like a snake, just walk away from that old integument and step out new into the air. Humans thrive on the metaphors of rebirth and regeneration, and the trouble is that they're nearly always only metaphors. But it's the actuality of spring that overwhelms us. Every hour peels back another layer of snow and shrinks the dominion of ice. The ground gives, and the sap streams upward. The finches molt into their mating colors. I walk out among it all and find myself hoping to change with the season, too. VERLYN KLINKENBORG The Rural Life"
"An unusually cold late winter has left 90 percent of Lakes Superior, Huron and Erie -- an area larger than the state of New York -- covered with ice, a condition that officials say could threaten the start of the shipping season. Lake Superior, the largest and deepest of the lakes, was almost 98 percent covered with ice on Thursday, the date of the most recent survey by the National Ice Center, a unit of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. A complete freeze-over would be the first since 1979, said Greg Rose, public affairs officer for the center. ''It has its own unique beauty,'' said Davis Helberg, executive director of the Duluth Seaway Port Authority, whose office looks out on Lake Superior. ''I've been in this business for 45 years and I've seen ice like this maybe three times.'' Northern and coastal sections of Lakes Michigan and Ontario also have significant ice cover, though large sections are free of ice, Mr. Rose said. The lakes are not frozen over like a pond or skating rink, but they are largely covered with ice, in some spots a few inches thick, in other places several feet. The icy conditions have already pushed back the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway, which connects the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean. The seaway is now scheduled to open to ship traffic on March 31, instead of March 25. Opening of the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., the link between Superior and the other lakes, is still set for March 25, though that date could be threatened if conditions do not improve, Mr. Helberg said. Most of the shipping traffic in the Great Lakes carries raw materials like iron ore and coal from Duluth, Minn., and other ports on Lake Superior to ports near Chicago, Detroit and Cleveland on the lower lakes. Water levels on the Great Lakes have been low for several years and are not expected to be higher this year, Mr. Helberg said. Because ships must carry lighter loads when lake levels are down, carriers try to make as many trips as possible in the shipping season. So a delay in the start of the season this year could be especially costly, Mr. Helberg said. The United States Coast Guard maintains a fleet of six thick-hulled icebreakers on the Great Lakes that plow through ice sheets that can be several feet thick. The boats also shoot jets of water under the ice to break up the floes. Petty Officer Paul Roszkowski of the Coast Guard was in Chicago today on the 140-foot icebreaker Mobile Bay, which was breaking up ice around Calumet Harbor and Burns Harbor, south of the city. ''The ice we are seeing is way out of the ordinary for a typical winter around here,'' Petty Officer Roszkowski said. ''It's rare for us to see such thick ice.'' This winter, the area has had less snow than normal, and December and January were unusually warm. But in February the temperature averaged 5 degrees below normal. Today's low in Duluth was 13 below zero, compared with the normal 14 above. Mr. Helberg, who began working on the Great Lakes as a deckhand in 1959, says that when he looks out over Lake Superior on his morning drive to work, he sees a nearly uninterrupted field of ice, grayish because it is largely bare of snow. The same powerful waters that claimed the 729-foot-long freighter Edmund Fitzgerald in 1975 are now locked under a vast stillness, stretching the 360-mile length of the lake. ''We have to have weather like this every once in a while to remind us how puny we are,'' Mr. Helberg said."
"Dig We Must Q. Considering the amount of snow we got last month, I wonder how the city dealt with major snowstorms before the invention of the snowplow? A. The 26.1 inches of snow in February was a reminder of the value of the city's fleet of 350 snowplows. Before their arrival, New York had to dig itself out of a big storm, one scoop at a time. Although the city had horse-drawn plows for snow removal, they were effective only when a horse was willing to charge ahead in the snow. With anything more than a few inches, the city hired a temporary force of thousands of men to shovel the streets. For many of those preplow years, New York was controlled by Tammany Hall, which gave shoveling jobs to friends, family and loyalists. In Jeff Kisseloff's oral history of Manhattan, ''You Must Remember This'' (Johns Hopkins, 2000), a laborer named Bill Bailey recalled a riot's breaking out because Tammany loyalists bypassed a line of would-be shovelers and walked out of the clubhouse with a job that paid a then-generous 50 cents an hour. As snowplows became more common and effective after the 1930's, the city drastically cut back the number of temporary shovelers, although there is a need from time to time. After the blizzard of President's Day weekend, the Transportation Department offered $8 an hour for people willing to put their shovel to work for the city. You had to bring your own. Masonic Movements Q. On my way to work, I pass a building on West 34th Street now called the Manhattan Center. Carved into its facade are the words ''Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite.'' What does this mean? A. The phrase refers to the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite of Free Masonry, an order of the New York Freemasons who once occupied that building. A well-known fraternal organization, the Freemasons have been in New York since the place was called New Amsterdam. The first Grand Lodge of Freemasonry was opened in New York in 1781 (until then all Freemason lodges were part of a grand lodge in England). In 1789 George Washington was sworn as America's first president at Federal Hall in Lower Manhattan on a bible borrowed from the Freemason grand lodge on Lower Broadway. In 1867 the Freemasons moved their grand lodge to 23rd Street and Sixth Avenue. In 1910 a new grand lodge was constructed in an adjacent lot at 24th Street. Over the years, several Freemason lodges have sprung up around the city, including the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite, who occupied the Manhattan Center at 311 West 34th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, for just over a decade in the 1920's and 30's. Today the Scottish Rite, and 64 other Freemason lodges, meet at the Grand Lodge, still on 24th Street. Famous New York Freemasons include Fiorello H. La Guardia, Harry Houdini, Duke Ellington and John Jacob Astor. A Lost Colony Q. My grandparents met at Woodland Beach on Staten Island. It seems to have dropped off the map. What happened? A. Woodland Beach was a private beach colony on the island's south shore between Lincoln Avenue and the Vanderbilt estate (now Miller Field), according to John W. Guild of the Staten Island Historical Society. Woodland Beach had its heyday from 1907 to 1950, at a time when Staten Island had many similar beachfront resorts, with boardwalks, amusement parks, shooting galleries and vaudeville shows. A hurricane in 1950 and several fires destroyed many of the wooden buildings, but some of the Woodland Beach bungalows were renovated into year-round homes in the residential neighborhood of Midland Beach.

"Ugh. That seemed to be the collective response to the snowstorm that gave a cold, wet hug to the New York metropolitan region yesterday, as people once again struggled with shovels, lost traction on roadways, coped with cabin fever and generally pined for spring. ''I just want to see green,'' said Michael O'Rourke, a traffic engineer who lives in Ossining, in Westchester County. ''I'm tired of seeing the white and ice and dirty snow.'' Anyone hoping that March might defy the old saying by creeping in like a lamb felt a wave of disappointment yesterday. Spring fever would have to wait. In most areas, crocus shoots and snowdrops remained tantalizingly out of view. From northern Connecticut to western New Jersey, highways formed a slick, slushy landscape punctuated by police flares and tow trucks. School officials were using up precious snow days. And towns and villages were dispatching snow plows and sand trucks, even though in some cases they had already exhausted snow-removal budgets that were supposed to last through the end of the year. A band of wet snow moved eastward from the Ohio Valley, enveloping the East Coast from New Jersey to Massachusetts. In much of the New York metropolitan area, it arrived just in time for the morning rush. New York City got off relatively easy, with Central Park recording 3.5 inches. That brought total snowfall in the park this winter to 45.3 inches, double the average seasonal snowfall of 22.4 inches, according to Chris Johannesson, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. The heaviest snow fell north and east of the city. When it was over, Garfield, in Bergen County, N.J., had recorded 6 inches; White Plains, 6.7 inches; New Canaan, Conn., 8.3 inches; East Hampton, on Long Island, 6.6 inches, and Circleville, in Orange County, N.Y., 10.2. Transportation officials and highway police throughout the region reported scores of fender benders and spinouts, as well as vehicles stranded in ditches. Traffic slowed to a frustrating crawl in spots, but no deaths were reported. Cars traveling too fast for snow and ice resulted in two pile-ups within minutes of each other in Middlebury, Conn. The state police said that about 10 a.m., six vehicles crashed while traveling west on Interstate 84 near Exit 17; 15 minutes later, five vehicles collided in the same location. There were no injuries in either accident. Trains fared better; the isolated delays paled in comparison to the disruptions in service caused by the Feb. 17 blizzard. For example, only two Metro-North trains, both on the railroad's New Haven line, were held up during yesterday morning's rush because of the snow, said Daniel Brucker, the railroad's spokesman. In Connecticut and New York State, many school districts closed or dismissed students early. In New Jersey, most public schools remained open, with administrators deciding early in the morning that the bulk of the snow would not arrive until later, and would not be too severe. With the season's major snowstorms having occurred on Christmas and Presidents' Day, most school districts found they still had a snow day or two left. But Yonkers yesterday used the last of its four days. Eric W. Schoen, the district spokesman, said he thought the district used only one day last year. ''And the year before we didn't use any,'' he said. Some businesses were restlessly awaiting warm weather to put consumers in the mood for summer goods. Employees at Fortunoff in Westbury, N.Y., surveyed the strangely quiet showroom of outdoor furniture and grills, all 34,000 square feet of it. ''We've had enough of this,'' said Arlene Putterman, a spokeswoman for Fortunoff, referring to the snow. So had Jay Patel, co-owner of Henry's Fine Foods in Verona, N.J. ''I hate it,'' he grumbled, as he shoveled his front sidewalk. Mr. Patel said he had spent about $2,000 so far this winter to have his parking lot plowed. In New York City, there was confusion over whether the city had suspended alternate-side street cleaning rules. (It had not.) On blocklong Magaw Place in Washington Heights, any uncertainty disappeared when, as the clock tower of the Fort Washington Collegiate Church tolled 11 a.m., a police sedan pulled onto the street. Within minutes, a dozen cars had $35 tickets. Tom Cocola, a spokesman for the city's Department of Transportation, sounded almost sheepish by late afternoon. ''Unfortunately, the weather didn't cooperate the way we thought it would,'' he said. ''We thought the snow was going to be a little later in the day and not as intense.''"
"Many fourth graders at Hernandez Elementary School here do not remember what they did on their last snow day, which was two years ago. Others like Gabriel Prado, 10, remember just the painful parts, like being hit by a snowball thrown by his older brother. Although the students cross their fingers and hope for the big morning announcement every time the sky becomes gray, two years, they say, is a long time to think back on their last lucky break. And that has become a problem for the students, who have to retake part of the state's standardized test. A question on the fourth-grade writing section of the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, which all the state's fourth graders took on Thursday, asked them to imagine waking up to their ''dream come true,'' school being canceled because of a snowstorm. Students were asked to ''write a story about a snow day off from school that you remember.'' It has been years since many Massachusetts school districts, including Boston, have canceled school because of inclement weather. Although heavy snow fell this winter, almost all of it was on weekends or vacations. Many students, educators said, have no idea what a snow day is. That is especially true in urban districts, they say, where many students have emigrated from countries with warm climates. Urban students are also at a disadvantage because they, unlike their suburban counterparts, often do not ''have mom at home to do activities with'' and often just watch television, said Margarita Muniz, principal at Hernandez Elementary, a bilingual school that teaches primarily in English. Wilfredo T. Laboy, superintendent of the Lawrence district, which is 89 percent Spanish speaking, said: ''I believe it is culturally biased. For kids from Santo Domingo, Southeast Asia or other warm climates, what do they say about snow?'' A spokeswoman for the State Education Department, Heidi Perlman, said the question went through a rigorous evaluation, including passage before a bias review committee. The department, Ms. Perlman said, did not consider that some students might not know what a snow day is. But after some parents called, the department decided to give principals at schools that did not have snow days the option of re-administering the test on May 8. The principals also have the option of giving the test to individual students who might have been at a disadvantage because they recently arrived from a warmer climate. The question, which, on its face, seemed ''harmless enough,'' Ms. Perlman said, and was meant just to judge writing ability. ''It's entirely a question to judge how well a student can write,'' she said. ''If a student can write an essay about watching TV, that's fine. It's looking at their grammar, their spelling and their writing. It's not about the content.'' Boston is the sole district that requires all fourth graders -- almost 5,000 -- to retake the test, said Jonathan Palumbo, a spokesman for the Boston Public Schools. He said the district wanted to give all students the same opportunity to do well. Thomas Potter, superintendent of the Central Berkshire district in western Massachusetts, canceled school once this year. Mr. Potter can understand why some parents might be suspicious about the question if their children had not had snow days, but said most students in the state could imagine what a snow day would be like. ''I don't think it's culturally biased at all,'' Mr. Potter said. Rebecca Jackson, 10, from Hernandez Elementary, said the test was ''sort of hard'' because she ''knows what I do on snow days, but not on particular snow days.'' She wrote about ''three things I like to do when it snows: ice skating, forts and sledding.'' Victor Mejia, 9, said he thought that the question was not fair because some students like him had trouble remembering what occurred two years ago, a long, long time in a fourth grader's world. But Kevin Vega, 10, said it was not difficult for him to remember the shiny sled that he used with his family. ''Some of us can't forget that day,'' Kevin said. When asked whether they wanted to retake the test, class members screeched a high-pitched drawn-out, ''Nooooo!'' ''Does this mean we have to take the MCAS again?'' Gabriel asked. ''I don't want to. It was annoying enough the first time.''"
"The Yankees' home opener Monday afternoon against Minnesota has been postponed until Tuesday at 4:05 p.m. in anticipation of a snowstorm. Manager Joe Torre said he wanted the game to be played as scheduled, but he was glad he would not have to spend much of Monday in the Yankee Stadium clubhouse, feeling frustrated, waiting for the weather to improve. ''Though we've played our first six games on the road, that still doesn't take anything away from how important our home opener is,'' Torre said. ''You can just feel everybody's heartbeat there. They're right on top of you.'' The schedule could be revised because Tuesday was originally scheduled as a day off for the Yankees. The announcement of the early cancellation was greeted warmly by Andy Pettitte, who was expected to pitch. ''It's always a letdown when you go to the park and you're hanging around, waiting to see what will happen,'' he said. Torre said he expected the new Yankee Hideki Matsui to be met by a ''thunderous'' reception from fans. ''I think they'll make him feel at home,'' Torre said. ''He plays with the kind of effort and hustle that I think our fans like.'' BASEBALL"
"Never mind the records or the averages. What matters isn't what happened years ago or what usually happens -- just what happened yesterday. A mass of warm air sliding up from the south collided with a dome of unseasonably cold air, and snow fell in New York City and across the mid-Atlantic states. It came down in demoralizing fistfuls, like scraps of winter's calendar flung into spring. Everything was put on hold: the rose leaves in Bryant Park, the first blush on the buds in the botanical gardens, even the Yankees' home opener. Winter has never seemed quite so reluctant to retreat for good. If nothing else, the snowstorm brought a kind of temporal chaos, caused in part by the shift over the weekend to daylight saving time. The extra hour of sunlight at the end of the day felt like an augury of summer, no matter what form of precipitation was falling from the sky. But the extra hour of darkness in the morning made it feel as if we had jumped backward a month or two. The snow only confounded the season further. Soon enough all the clues will point in the right direction, toward an unstoppable spring. For now we will have to make do with vernal hopes and intentions. The one consolation, especially for those who groaned when they saw the flakes falling yesterday, is that this snowfall will not be around for long. Consider it the last cleansing of the city -- a rechristening of sorts -- before summer's grime. Say that it proves, once again, the hardiness of New Yorkers or shows at least what we have to put up with. But just say there's no more winter to come."
"The last time the Yankees were snowed out of an opener at Yankee Stadium, it marked the onset of 13 years of famine. Yankee crops turned rotten and the stadium field lay fallow in the longest postseason absence since the Yankees began winning pennants in 1921. The Yankees, coming off their fourth World Series appearance in six years, were scheduled to open the 1982 season on Tuesday April 6, but a blizzard, worse than yesterday's snowfall, buried the stadium under more than a foot of snow. The opener was rescheduled for April 8, the same date this season's delayed home opener is now supposed to be played, but it wasn't played that day, either. The Texas Rangers, managed by Don Zimmer, were in New York for two games but left without playing any. The Chicago White Sox followed the Rangers for a three-game series, but the Friday and Saturday games were postponed because the grounds crew was unable to remove all the snow and get the field in playing condition. Drifts had created snow piles more than two feet high in left field, and it took an expanded crew of 150 workers to shovel the snow. They worked until 11:30 Friday night, then returned at 6 a.m. Saturday to finish clearing the field and the stands. A helicopter was brought in to help disperse the remaining water from left field. As the season turned out, the Yankees should have been in no hurry to start it. When May arrived, they were in sixth place (in a seven-team division), they never rose higher than third and they finished in fifth, 16 games from first. Maybe it was the delay to the start of their season, or maybe it was the owner's plan that went awry. Having lost the 1981 World Series, George Steinbrenner decided the Yankees needed a change. Instead of relying on power, as they always had, Steinbrenner decreed that the Yankees would become a speed team that would run its way to the World Series. But first they had to begin the season, and they finally did on April 11, five days late. Playing an opening day Sunday doubleheader, they lost twice to the White Sox, 7-6 in 12 innings, and 2-0. Ron Guidry started the first game but lasted only four innings. Tommy John pitched a complete game in the second game of the season, but the Yankees couldn't score runs. The starting shortstop in the second game, who had also been a pinch-hitter in the opener, had not been a member of the Yankees when the season was supposed to start. On April 10, maybe out of a need to fill the extra time they had with all that snow on the field, the Yankees acquired Roy Smalley from the Minnesota Twins. ''What am I going to do with Smalley?'' Manager Bob Lemon said privately. ''I already have a shortstop.'' Indeed, Bucky Dent was the Yankee shortstop, but Steinbrenner, along with his speed plan, decided it would help to have two starters for every position. The players who played the positions did not think it necessary, but the owner did not solicit their opinions. Later that season, on Aug. 8, the Yankees traded Dent to the Rangers for Lee Mazzilli. That trade was one of several the Yankees made that season. Only 12 days after they played their delayed opener, the Yankees traded Bob Watson, one of their first basemen, to the Atlanta Braves. ''George got upset with me for not wanting to come to spring training early to work on bunting after Bobby Murcer messed up the bunt in the World Series,'' Watson recalled yesterday in a reference to the 1981 World Series, which the Yankees lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games. ''He said he was going to trade me.'' But when it came time for Steinbrenner to follow through on his threat, or promise, he gave Watson his choice of Philadelphia, Los Angeles or Atlanta. ''I chose Atlanta because Joe was there,'' Watson said, meaning Joe Torre, then the Braves' manager, ''and at the time they were 13 and 0.'' As he spoke, Watson was sitting in his office at the commissioner's office, where he is vice president for on-field operations. He had planned to attend the Yankees' home opener, but he said, ''I'm looking out my window on the 34th floor and it's really coming down.'' Dave Revering was another Yankees first baseman in 1982. Actually, Revering was supposed to be the everyday first baseman, a status he supposedly earned by hitting .465 in spring training exhibition games. But the snow delay did in Revering. He did not get a hit in five times at bat in the opener, striking out twice, and Watson started at first base in the second game of the doubleheader. Revering batted for Watson in the seventh inning and made another out. On May 5, after Revering managed only 6 hits in 40 at-bats (.150), he, too, was traded, to Toronto for John Mayberry. Mayberry played first base some of the time the rest of the season. So did Davey Collins. Collins epitomized Steinbrenner's speed plan. Steinbrenner recruited and signed Collins as a free agent because he was fast and could steal. He had 79 stolen bases for Cincinnati in 1980. The only problem was the Yankees did not have a position for Collins, an outfielder. They already had an outfield filled with Dave Winfield, Jerry Mumphrey, Ken Griffey, Lou Piniella and Oscar Gamble. But Steinbrenner assured Collins during a breakfast meeting in New York that he would receive enough playing time. ''How do you know you can trust him?'' Collins's wife said to her husband after the breakfast. Collins, who had only 348 at-bats, lasted only that season with the Yankees. But that was longer than Bob Lemon lasted as manager. Despite his winter proclamation that Lemon would be the manager the entire season, Steinbrenner fired him after only 14 games. In other words, Lemon did not last much longer than the snow delay.

"In the winter that would not die, the snowstorm that nobody wanted had the effrontery to deliver yet another unappreciated gift to the metropolitan region yesterday, doing its best to nip spring quite literally in the bud. The unseasonable insult was, for some, the last straw in a winter-weary region that has not only been on high alert since Sept. 11, 2001, but that also more recently withstood a Washington's Birthday blizzard and round-the-clock Iraqi war advisories, not to mention SARS angst. ''Isn't everybody sick of this?'' said Sgt. Don Dragan of the New Jersey Transit Police in Hoboken, wrinkling his nose with disdain as the heavy flurries drifted down. ''This is trout season, not Christmas.'' Arriving pretty much as predicted toward the end of the morning rush, the storm's leading edge churned through New Jersey from the southwest, disrupting airport flight schedules, closing schools and bedeviling traffic on city streets and country roads before swirling eastward to spread blowing whiteouts over Long Island and Connecticut. After midnight, as the last drops of freezing drizzle headed east over Long Island, the storm had delivered five to eight inches of snow to the city and Long Island, with one to three inches in Connecticut and the Lower Hudson Valley, said Nancy Figueroa, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. In New Jersey, eight inches fell on Cranford and seven inches on Elizabeth, she said. While there was fierce opposition from isolated pockets of resistance, the response to the snow was outright capitulation in some quarters. For example, the home opener of the New York Yankees against the Minnesota Twins was postponed before the arrival of a single snowflake. But others, already accommodated to spring, showed the storm a measure of contempt. Erik Mitchell sought no more protection from the elements than blue jeans and a thin checkered shirt as he methodically moved wallboard into a new storefront on West 33rd Street in Manhattan. ''This is nothing,'' he said. ''I'm sweating too much to freeze.'' For an April snowstorm, ''this one was unusual for its accumulation, thanks to the large amount of unseasonably cold air in the area,'' said Tim Morrin, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. Snow falling in April is not a rarity, ''but people are right in thinking that April snow that actually sticks is rare,'' said Stephen Fybish, a Manhattan climate researcher. ''Nine of the last 20 Aprils have had at least some snowflakes. But only four have had measurable snow.'' From Connecticut to the New Jersey Highlands, villages and towns that had spent down their snow-removal budgets somehow found the resources to rev up plows and saltspreaders, while merchants hauled out their snowy wares. ''We have a couple of shovels, but all the snow-melt was gone even before the Presidents' Day blizzard,'' said Victor Ash, proprietor of M. J. Hardware in Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. For a time yesterday, the snow did not stick on still-warm pavements and roads. But the greater accumulations on lawns and shrubs drove customers to frantically call garden stores about budding shrubs and droopy daffodils. ''I told everyone that the snow works as an insulator,'' said Tim Hanrahan, a manager at Ploch's Home and Garden Center in Clifton, N.J. ''They could damage their buds by knocking off the snow.'' Those in traditional areas of hefty snow accumulation evidenced a wise-cracking stoicism. ''We don't think we're home free until April 15,'' said Estelle Anderson, who lives 900 feet up on a ridge in Kinnelon, N.J. ''But today, the robins are very annoyed. They can't get at their worms.'' Another annoyed redbreast was encountered at Buena Vista, a nine-hole golf course in West Hartford, Conn. The lone figure on the stormy fairway was a barrel-chested, red-vested golfer who took six shots out of a soggy bunker. ''Tough winter for golf,'' said the man, who gave his name only as Mark. In Suffolk County, Marie Banks chose to think of the weather as ''a little setback'' on her farm in Ridge. The snow made it difficult to work her six horses, already shedding their winter coats. Many people looked unprepared for the stinging winds and surprising cold. ''I've pretty much adjusted to spring,'' said one commuter, Chris Jay, as he waited, hatless, in his beige spring sport jacket, for the ferry in Hoboken, N.J. The snow was actually a naturalistic boon to crews from the television series ''Law and Order,'' which happened to be shooting its 300th episode outdoors on Riverside Drive in Manhattan yesterday and ''was able to capitalize on mother nature,'' said Katherine Oliver, commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting. And Jeff Zacharia, president of Zachys Wine and Liquor in Scarsdale, N.Y., said that from the moment his doors opened, foot traffic was up 10 percent from that on a normal day, and average sales were up 25 percent."
"ESKIMOS, it is said, have more than 100 words to describe snow. Those of us in more temperate climates have only a single word for snow, but we have numerous gadgets for removing it. In fact, a trip to any local home improvement center will reveal a huge selection of such machines -- ranging from inexpensive electric-powered, hand-held shovels to budget-busting, gas-powered behemoths that can hurl up to 1,800 pounds of snow up to 40 feet away in a minute. George Maher, a farm safety specialist for North Dakota State University extension service in Fargo -- and the school's resident expert on snow-removal machines -- said that there are two basic types of snow throwers: single stage and two stage (or dual stage.) A single-stage machine, he said, uses either a series of rapidly spinning driver blades -- like paddles -- or an auger assembly to pick up snow and then eject it from the machine, all in one motion. A two-stage snow thrower uses an auger to pull snow into the machine and then push it into an impeller -- basically, a high-speed fan -- which then ejects the snow out of the machine through a movable chute. Within those two basic categories of snow throwers, also known as snow blowers, however, are scores of mechanical variations, engines, snow-clearing capabilities and combinations of features that result in price tags that range from under $100 to $2,400 or even more. Scott Wozniak, marketing manager for the Toro Company in Minneapolis, said that the smallest, lightest and least expensive snow throwers are electric ''power shovels.'' ''They're meant for really light snow removal,'' Mr. Wozniak said. Electric shovels, he said, are generally hand-held machines that can clear a swath of snow about 12 inches wide. ''A cubic foot of wet snow can weigh up to 10 pounds,'' he said. ''So, for someone who has a bad back, a power shovel can be a real help.'' The next level of snow thrower, Mr. Wozniak said, is 16 or 18 inches wide. ''They can move about 700 to 1,100 pounds of snow a minute,'' which is about as fast as a person can move a machine through six inches of snow, he said. These single-stage machines can be either electric powered or gasoline powered. In the case of Toro's single-stage gas snow throwers, Mr. Wozniak said, the paddles used to scoop up the snow are made of rubber. ''That allows the machine to clear down to the pavement,'' he said, adding that the rotating paddles also move the machine forward. ''Most single-stage machines propel themselves by allowing the auger or paddle to contact the pavement,'' Mr. Wozniak said. ''And most two-stage machines are going to be propelled by mechanically driven wheels.'' Mr. Maher of North Dakota State University said that in addition to having traction-producing wheels, most two-stage snow throwers have a number of forward speeds and one or two reverse speeds. ''Having reverse is more than just a convenience,'' he said, noting that since the engines on most two-stage snow throwers are fairly heavy -- generally, the larger two-stage snow throwers weigh more than 200 pounds -- backing them up without mechanical assistance can take a considerable effort. Another back-saving feature that many two-stage snow throwers have is an electric starter. ''Trying to pull-start larger engines can put a tremendous amount of strain on your shoulder and arm,'' Mr. Maher said, adding that in most cases, the starters on snow throwers are powered by plugging them into a 110-volt receptacle rather than by an on-board battery. And while tractor-mounted snow throwers might seem easier to use, he said, some of the larger walk-behind snow throwers do a better job. ''The riding snow throwers often have only a single-stage snow blower,'' he said. ''And that really limits their ability to move deep or heavy snow.'' (A two-stage snow blower, which moves into the snow at a slow constant speed, is generally able to move large amounts of snow greater distances than single-stage units.) ''Another problem with riding tractors is maintaining traction with the machine,'' he said, adding that in many cases it is necessary to add both chains and weights to the tractor to keep the tractor from slipping. ''With a walk-behind, as long as you have a set of chains on them, they'll just dig in and keep on going.'' Scott Schreiner, a divisional merchandise manager for Amazon.com, the Internet-based retailer, said his company carries about 40 different snow throwers from six manufacturers. Electric-powered snow blowers, Mr. Schreiner said, range in price from $99 to $299. Single stage, gas-powered machines, he said, range from $299 to $500, while two-stage snow throwers start at $539 -- for a 5 horsepower, 22-inch unit -- to about $2,400 for a 13 horsepower, 45-inch snow thrower. Troy Blewett, manager of corporate communications for Simplicity Manufacturing of Port Washington, Wis., the manufacturer of Simplicity and Snapper snow throwers, said that while a small electric or single-stage gas snow thrower might be appropriate for homeowners in the city who may have only a small swath of sidewalk to clear, those who have larger properties and driveways will almost always be better off with a dual-stage snow thrower. And each manufacturer, it seems, has its own bells and whistles intended to make their machine just a little bit easier to use than the competition's. Some of the larger Simplicity snow throwers, for example, have what is known as an ''easy turn'' feature, which allows the operator to turn the machine by interrupting the drive power to one of the wheels. ''You hold down one of the handles and the wheel on the right side of the machine turns freely to allow for easy maneuvering,'' he said. ''And for the person who has everything, we also have machines that have hand warmers in the grips,'' Mr. Blewett said. Mr. Maher, the safety specialist from North Dakota State University, said that no matter what kind of snow thrower a person buys, it is critical to use the machine safely. ''The No. 1 rule with a snow blower is that if the machine is running, you never, ever, try to pull anything out of it by hand,'' he said. ''It's amazing. You'd think people have common sense, but ever year a number of people get injured by sticking their hand into the machine.'' If the machine clogs and must be cleared, he said, it should be turned off. ''Just letting the engine idle is not safe enough,'' Mr. Maher said. Another mistake many people make, he said, is to attempt to refuel the snow blower while the engine is hot. ''Gasoline is extremely volatile,'' Mr. Maher said. ''And if it gets splashed on a hot muffler, the gas fumes can ignite.'' Finally, he said, it is important to avoid warming up a snow thrower in a garage. ''After you start the machine, immediately get it outdoors,'' he said. ''A running gasoline engine produces carbon monoxide. And carbon monoxide very reliably kills people.'' YOUR HOME"
"Talk about a home field advantage. Despite snowfall of up to three feet in parts of the Boston area, the New England Patriots carried on with their scheduled game here Sunday afternoon, perhaps hoping that the lollapalooza of a storm would disorient and derail the opposing team, the Dolphins of no-snow Miami. But the Patriots, who played in blowing snowflakes on a white-glazed field framed by mountains of snow (and won, 12-0), took care to make sure their fans were not caught unawares. ''We request ALL FANS to please CAR POOL,'' said a weather advisory issued by the team on its Web site. ''We cannot stress this enough!'' What's more, the advisory continued: ''Due to the overwhelming amount of snow in the stadium and the height of some of the snowdrifts, fans should expect many of the seats in the bowl of the stadium to be covered in snow. We advise all fans to bring blankets, snow gloves and snow boots and caution fans to expect to clear snow from their seats when they arrive.'' Stacey James, a spokesman for Patriots, said grounds crews had removed ''tons of snow,'' hauling it out on conveyor belts, but he added: ''It's like removing sand from the beach. It's next to impossible to get to some of the sections, but fans are doing it.'' The fans ''burrowed in like they're in igloos,'' he said. It was a quintessential New England way of dealing with a prodigious pounding by the weather: Just carry on, and don't expect it to be easy. On Sunday much of New England seemed dazed by a weekend-long snow deluge that traumatized traffic, contributed to at least six deaths in the Northeast, punched out power lines for some 7,000 residents of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, caused flooding along the coast and generally stalled things like SAT exams, Sunday school classes and the high school football playoffs. Coming two weeks ahead of the start of winter and on the heels of last winter's malingering snowstorms that lasted into April, this storm struck people with a kind of head-shaking surprise. ''It feels like winter just ended,'' muttered a woman who was trudging through the Natick Mall with two bundled-up children. She was part of a skeleton crew of shoppers at the cavernous mall in the western Boston suburbs. ''It is pretty light,'' said Stephanie Messina, a manager at the Waldenbooks in the mall, speaking of the traffic in her store. ''Just proportionately compared to what it should be this time of year, it's pretty sad, actually.'' Walter Drag, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Taunton, Mass., said the storm was one of the five worst in Massachusetts since 1950; most areas received 25 to 40 percent of their annual snowfall this weekend. ''It is early and notable,'' Mr. Drag said, adding that the odds were that the coming winter would be a snowy one. Usually, he said, ''when you get an early start, you're going to get more than normal.'' Scott Whittier, senior meteorologist at the weather service station in Burlington, Vt., said that while most people thought the worst storms occurred in January in February, the fiercest storms actually occurred in December and March, as the seasons are changing. ''We're in the transitional mode from summer to winter, and there's a lot of energy in the cold air in Canada and the warm air in the gulf,'' Mr. Whittier said. ''Whenever you have large air masses trying to fight one another, you get the most potent storm.'' The deaths attributed to the storm came in several New England states. In Rhode Island, a 46-year-old man riding a snowmobile was struck and killed by an Amtrak Acela Express train, and a 25-year-old man riding in an inner tube being towed by a truck was killed when he slammed into a pole. The driver of the truck was charged with driving under the influence, the police said. In Vermont, a 46-year-old woman and her 15-year-old daughter were killed while traveling in poor road conditions, the state police said. In Boston, which got about two feet of snow, Logan International Airport closed Saturday evening and did not reopen any runways until after noon on Sunday. Mayor Thomas M. Menino warned residents that they could be fined $250 if they shoveled snow onto city streets. In the Brighton neighborhood of Boston, cold, exasperated residents spent hours unearthing their cars from snowdrifts that stood higher than most people. Others walked in the brown, slushy streets or trekked through semi-shoveled sidewalks on their way to convenience stores, coffee shops and bars seeking respite from cabin fever. Groups of neighbors could be seen having what they called ''shovel parties,'' where everyone pitches in to dig out cars. Sebastian Beninca, 33, who works in construction, could not make it to work on Sunday, and by midafternoon he was shoveling out his car for the third time. ''I hope that's the last time,'' he said. ''My arms are tired.'' But for all the snow-induced stress, there were bright spots. Traffic accidents were greatly minimized throughout the region because the storm hit on a weekend, side-stepping commuter traffic. Operators of ski areas in Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine were beside themselves with glee over the early windfall of a snowfall. ''There are a lot of happy people here today,'' said Jim Costello, vice president of brand management for the Sunday River ski resort in Maine, who said more than 30 inches had fallen over the mountain by Sunday morning. ''I've been in the business 15 years and I've never seen this much snow this early in the season.'' In Boston, John Caplice, 43, who had spent hours shoveling out his car on Sunday -- breaking up his shoveling regimen with ''a big Irish breakfast'' -- said he had discovered an upside. ''People generally tend to say hello during snowstorms,'' said Mr. Caplice, a photographer, ''and they ignore you the rest of the year.''"
"Were you ready for this? You may have had the car winterized and your snow boots waterproofed and a new snowblower or snow shovel waiting in the garage or the basement, but the question still obtains: Were you ready for this? By midday yesterday, a map of the storm that buried the Northeast and the mid-Atlantic states over the weekend -- setting snowfall records along the way -- showed a blob of precipitation that reached from mid-Illinois to the Atlantic shoreline. Much of New England won't be free of the storm till sometime today. In the wake of the snowfall itself came strong winds that abruptly resculpted the landscape, undoing in an hour or two all the hard work of snow clearing that many people undertook too early. On Saturday night the winds sounded like snowplows on the highway, but they were plowing us in, not out. The particular cruelty of this blizzard is that it seemed to blow us all the way back to the middle of last winter, a winter that most of us have been trying hard to forget. Any hope that we had somehow earned a respite after last winter was, of course, a sentimental fantasy, as if the weather, an impersonal force if ever there was one, knew something about fair play. Any hope that we could ease into the season, which is still officially nearly two weeks away, now lies under two feet of snow in some parts of the region. ''Here we go,'' you could hear people saying, as though they were putting their heads down and trying to push a snow-stranded car out of the ditch. What they meant was something like, ''Now we're in for it,'' or ''Greetings, Mighty Winter -- please spare us your wrath.'' In fact there was no going anywhere on Saturday and early Sunday. More than a few people, schoolkids especially, found themselves wondering why the storm couldn't have brought its force to bear on a weekday, instead of a weekend. The real satisfaction in a sudden deluge of snow is having an unexpected holiday: a chance just to watch the weather reveal itself. For people who do their own plowing or shoveling -- or their own shopping and driving and walking -- the storm really added up to a lot of extra work. The beauty of weather -- like time itself -- is that we have no idea what lies in store for us. This could be a one-shot winter, a pummeling storm followed by unexpected mildness. Or it could turn out to be the kind of winter when you can skate on the Hudson. Speculation is idle, but that's what makes it so entertaining. The intensity of this storm has no predictive force. It contains no augury of things to come, except hours of snow removal. The hard part is knowing that whatever this season brings -- mild or bitter -- the region will probably finish digging out from under this Northeaster just in time for the start of winter proper."
"When it snows, Rob Leder skis. In the Bronx. Mr. Leder, a 48-year-old lawyer from Riverdale, straps on his cross-country skis, pulls on a merino wool hat and disappears into the snow-blanketed paradise of the Van Cortlandt Park golf course. He skies six holes. ''You don't think of the Bronx as a place to ski, but it's lovely,'' he said yesterday before heading off for a two-hour tour. ''I usually go at night. Nobody comes out in the snow.'' As Mr. Leder began to explain why he finds skiing a ''very Zen experience,'' some 150 Mexicans jogged past him on Broadway in an annual marathon, ranchero music blaring from loudspeakers, in honor of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Mexico's patron saint. The rare early-season snowfall was not about to stop life in the Bronx. With more than a foot of snow, cars whirred as they slipped and slid in and out of parking spots, snowplows prowled the streets and shovels scraped sidewalks in an endless cacophony. ''There's a saying: he who falls in the snow doesn't go back to his country, because he likes it too much,'' said Ezzard Rodriguez, a 53-year-old janitor from Puerto Rico, as he helped some weary friends clear snow from the entrance to a Mobil station on Broadway. The wintry paradise of Henry Hudson Park in Riverdale evoked a Norman Rockwell scene until a snowboard intervened. It was Courtney Segal's second attempt at the sport -- her father bought the board yesterday morning. Arms out and legs bent, she pushed off and surfed downward. ''There she goes!'' said her mother, Edan Segal. ''Look at Courtney,'' she told her 5-year-old son, Jake. He was not amused. ''Do you have a carrot or anything to make a snowman?'' he asked his mother. ''No, you can use a twig,'' she replied. ''Can you go back to the house?'' Jake pressed on, still hoping for a carrot. ''Uch,'' was Mrs. Segal's answer."
"After two days of fame, the gigantic, nameless snowstorm that had dominated life in the Northeast churned to oblivion in the North Atlantic yesterday as armies of plows cleared highways, airports limped back toward normal schedules and the residents of a dozen states began to dig out of mountainous drifts. The storm, the biggest on record for early December in New York, left behind a buried landscape from Virginia to Maine, thousands of frustrated travelers, hundreds of traffic accidents, at least six deaths and a daunting task of snow removal on countless secondary roads, side streets and private driveways. The National Weather Service recorded startling snowfall totals for early December: 36 inches in Peabody, just north of Boston; 32 in Rensselaer County in upstate New York; 23 in Cliffside Park, N.J.; 21 near Providence; 18 to 20 on Long Island; 18 in Albany; 17 in Hartford; and 12 to 16 inches in New York City. Central Park's 14 inches was more than half its 22.4-inch average for the entire winter season (and the formal start of winter is still almost two weeks off). Since 1900, when accurate record-keeping began, there had never been a storm this big so early, said Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. Across much of the stricken region, storm clouds gave way to patches of sun yesterday and, despite biting temperatures in the 20's and an icy wind, a lighter mood seemed to settle over many town and country settings. The hills teemed with sledders and skiers, holiday shoppers flocked to malls and department stores, and the sounds of shovels, snow blowers and spinning tire chains filled neighborhoods. ''It's wonderful,'' said Sofiya Milchin, 65, a retired mechanical engineer and art teacher who was clearing snow from her Nissan Altima on a Brooklyn street while listening to classical music on a Walkman. She beamed at a memory of long ago. ''It's like my childhood in Siberia.'' In Metuchen, N.J., Jim Kimball was less lighthearted. He had spent three hours attacking the drifts that had swallowed both of his cars outside the home where he has lived -- and shoveled faithfully -- for 30 years. ''Am I used to this?'' he moaned. ''No. Do I ever want to see this again? No.'' After continuous plowing operations by states and municipalities, the major highways and many secondary roads across the region were clear, and relatively light Sunday traffic moved easily. Many city and suburban side streets, even those that had been plowed once, were still snowy, and officials said it might be days before the icy, lumpy remnants of the storm ceased to be a problem. Forecasters called for another cold, sunny day today, with a high in the low 30's, but said the temperatures could approach a relatively balmy 50 degrees by Wednesday. Operations yesterday at Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Liberty Airports began to recover from the turmoil of hundreds of flight delays and cancellations. Metro-North, the Long Island Rail Road, New Jersey Transit and other commuter rail lines in the region ran on their regular schedules yesterday, and subway and bus operations were near to normal. Amtrak, after keeping on schedule through most of the storm, ran into problems yesterday afternoon. A spokesman, Dan Stessel, said snow-related backups in the South Boston rail yards generated delays of two to three hours on southbound Amtrak trains out of Boston. Thousands of travelers in New York, Newark, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington were affected. Northbound Amtrak trains in the Northeast Corridor were delayed less than an hour, he said, while Metroliners, which use different tracks, were not affected. Operations were expected to be back to normal today, he said. A Boston-bound Acela express struck and killed a snowmobiler at Exeter, R.I., at 7:45 p.m. Saturday, Mr. Stessel said. At least five other deaths were reported by the police in traffic accidents during the storm -- two in New Jersey and one each in Connecticut, Pennsylvania and upstate New York. The snow, while deep, was relatively dry and light, and so tended not to cling to or bring down power lines, so there were no major power failures in the region. Con Edison reported no problems in New York City and Westchester. The Long Island Power Authority said 5,100 customers were affected by scattered power failures, many of them caused by vehicles knocking down power poles. Getting around yesterday was still difficult, but many people who had holed up for the duration got out to catch up on errands or to shop for groceries or Christmas presents. In East Rutherford, N.J., hit by 14 inches of snow, Giants Stadium, with a capacity of 78,000, was about half filled with diehard fans who watched the Redskins beat the Giants, 20-7. But there was work for some. Susan Freedner, 59, a semi-retired foreign exchange broker, was out shoveling snow from her driveway in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn. ''The generation of kids who want to shovel is disappearing,'' she lamented. ''Kids don't want to work for a couple of dollars.'' Nearby, however, a group of boys was gloating over their snow-shoveling earnings. Tanel Saar, 15, said he had made about $80 on Saturday, and his brother, Kalev, 17, said he made $150. ''I've heard that some houses paid $125,'' he said. The brothers were saving for a trip to Europe. Proclaiming the storm past and the city streets passable, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg rattled off a battery of statistics: 1,700 snowplows and salt and sand spreaders on the roads, 80,000 tons of salt put out. He then took a break and stopped at Prospect Park in Brooklyn for a look at the sledders and a bit of fun. He quickly found himself fending off a little boy. ''Mr. Mayor,'' said the lad, ''would you like to use my sled?'' Mr. Bloomberg demurred. A man made a similar offer. The mayor declined, saying that, with his luck, he'd probably hit a tree with the cameras rolling. But when he saw Wayne Batcheler, 61, dragging an elegant nine-foot antique toboggan, his resistance crumbled. As the photographers scrambled, he hopped on between Mr. Batcheler and his friend, Ellen Mendlow, and whizzed downhill. ''It was fun!'' a flushed Mr. Bloomberg declared. Then he was back to work, urging pedestrians and drivers to take care."
"According to legend, New Yorkers have hundreds of names for snow, depending on whether it is the stuff under the spinning tire of a car trying to escape being plowed in, the puffy or sticky mound on your snow shovel just as you begin to ponder the statistics of heart attacks, the streaks flying like sprites across an airport runway or the missiles stinging your face as you trudge up an urban canyon under a load of packages, the goop of suspicious integrity lying in wait as you step off the curb. Unfortunately most of these linguistic riches are unprintable here. You can catch it on your tongue. You can pack it into a ball and smash your best friend in the face. You can slide down hills of it on sticks or garbage can lids screaming or whooping or laughing. You can build a house out of it. You can lie and make angels in it. You can simply walk in it, feeling the silence and the landscape getting soft and close. But the next time it snows the first thing I'm going to do is grab my magnifying glass and run outside to look at car windshields, the better to appreciate the dance between destiny and contingency, the collision of law and chance that is one of nature's simplest but most sublime creations, the humble snowflake. Blame it on ''The Snowflake, Winter's Secret Beauty,'' a new book written by Dr. Kenneth Libbrecht, with photographs by Patricia Rasmussen. Dr. Libbrecht, chairman of the physics department at the California Institute of Technology, is a snowflake junkie who grew up in North Dakota, where the various forms of snow are plentiful this time of year. He grows snowflakes on needle tips in his lab when he is not busy looking for the gravity waves that, according to Einstein, should ripple the cosmos. ''A snowflake is a temporary work of art,'' Dr. Libbrecht writes in this book, which is part history, part physics lesson, part sumptuous photo gallery and overall field guide to the beauty so often lost afloat and underboot in this dark season. Pinned like transient butterflies in the gaze Dr. Libbrecht's special photo-microscope is an enormous shining variety, a sort of Benetton advertisement in ice. Some look like stained glass, some like six-armed circuit boards inscribed with curious and purposeful-looking fine lines, some are spidery concoctions, but some seem almost bony, sturdy enough to tile a turtle's back, while others are embroidered six-armed crosses worthy of an illuminated manuscript or of heraldic insignia. Some are needles and some look like spiky mallets. The flakes go by almost as many names as snow itself: dendrites, capped columns, needles, bullets, sectored plates, sheaths, split stars and chandelier crystals, not to mention diamond dust -- tiny crystals most often found suspended high in the coldest, driest parts of the atmosphere where they reflect and refract sunlight to create spectacles like halos, and spots of light called sundogs. What they all have in common is a core of the six-pointed symmetry that adorns ski sweaters and Christmas tree ornaments. That symmetry has been the object of scholarly fascination since at least the time of Johannes Kepler, who adduced that it had something to do with as-yet-unknown physics. We now know that classic shape is a consequence of basic atomic physics, Dr. Libbrecht explains. Snow forms when water vapor condenses into a crystal. Water molecules come in a ''V'' shape, with an oxygen atom at the vertex and two hydrogen atoms forming the arms at an angle of about 104 degrees apart, close to the angle that the sides of a hexagon make with each other. So when the first water molecules link up they naturally form what Dr. Libbrecht calls a ''puckered hexagon.'' As more water molecules float by to join them, they build up a lattice of six-sided segments. But what happens next depends on such vagaries as the temperature and humidity in which this prototype snowflake finds itself, according to studies carried out by a Japanese nuclear physicist, Dr. Ukichiro Nakaya, at the University of Hokkaido, in the 1930's. In relatively dry air, for example, the sides of the hexagon grow slowly and evenly into a plate or a six-sided rod. In more humid conditions, however, the corners of the hexagon begin to grow faster than the flat faces because water molecules in the surrounding air don't have to travel as far to land there. The more the corners stick out, the more advantage they have attracting more molecules, and so the faster they grow. Corners become long branches; random bumps on the branches become side branches, resulting in the feathery shapes called dendrites. Over the course of its life a snowflake may go through many different stages of growth as the wind dances it from cloud to cloud, from drier to moister or warmer or cooler environs, all of them leaving their marks on the final flake, as shown in Dr. Libbrecht's portrait gallery. If snowflakes are art, he writes in the book, then wind is the artist. By the time it is done growing there are about a billion billion water molecules in a typical snowflake, Dr. Libbrecht says. And on average, he calculates, each of us on Earth has contributed by exhalation and evaporation about 1,000 of the molecules in each snowflake. It is this character-building growth experience that accounts for the vaunted individuality of snowflakes, the book explains. The morphology of the snowflake that falls on your windshield depends on the random and erratic path it took from its birth as a seedling to get there. Since no two crystals will follow the exact same path, it is unlikely any two of them will look identical. ''We can calculate the odds of identical snowflakes: they are astronomically small,'' Dr. Libbrecht said in an interview. Dr. Libbrecht said that when he was a boy building snow forts and throwing snowballs, he never dreamed that he would one day take a scientific interest in snow. In 1997, however, he became interested in the way crystals grew, and that led him to snowflakes. ''Snowflakes are crystals,''he said. On a visit to his sister in North Dakota, he realized, like many a prodigal son, how much he had not appreciated as a child. They went out looking to see if they could find the different varieties of snowflake. ''They were all there,'' he said."
"If the previous weekend's Northeaster was a record-breaking blockbuster, the snowstorm that blew through New York yesterday was its watered-down sequel, a short-lived, easily forgotten ''Return of the Blizzard'' that fazed most New Yorkers about as much as a car alarm. But however fleeting, it was the second straight weekend of snowfall before Christmas, and forecasters and weather-watchers were lobbing around phrases like ''most snow ever'' and ''wettest December.'' Including the 5.8 inches of snow yesterday, 19.8 inches has fallen in New York City this season, said Stephen Fybish, an amateur weather historian. According to Mr. Fybish, the past two weeks have been snowier than any first half of December since 1869. ''You're living in the snowiest winter to date in New York City,'' said Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. But with the exception of long delays at the airports, life in the city continued to hum away smoothly through the sleet and slush, and by late afternoon the wet snow had given way to a steady rain that forecasters said would erase the 3- to 5-inch accumulations. Temperatures were expected to linger above freezing overnight, according to the National Weather Service, which expected little threat of icy roads for commuters this morning. Drivers crossed the Hudson and East Rivers with few problems, and though some cars spun out and banged into others, no serious accidents or major traffic snarls were reported in the city, or in New Jersey or Westchester or on Long Island, the police said. Officials at New York City Transit, Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road reported no delays, and officials with Con Edison and the Long Island Power Authority said there had been no reports of power failures. Air travelers and residents of upstate New York and Connecticut did not fare as well. Thirty flights were canceled at Kennedy Airport, and La Guardia Airport reported 160 cancellations and delays of two and a half hours. ''For people who are traveling, it's as bad as the last storm,'' said Dan Maynard, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. It was still snowing in Connecticut and in upstate New York yesterday evening, and forecasters predicted as much as two feet of snow for the Catskills region and parts of the Hudson Valley. In Connecticut, more than 150 traffic accidents tangled the roads, The Associated Press reported. In Midtown Manhattan, last week's winter wonderland atmosphere was replaced by gray skies and icy rains. Sunday shoppers heel-toed over sidewalks of slippery slush and goose-stepped over puddles at curbs. For the second time in two weeks, they braced against the wind and blinked away the snow, but talk of the weather was largely pre-empted by discussions of shopping, the Heisman Trophy and Saddam Hussein. A group of tourists from Portsmouth, England -- themselves familiar with cold, gray weather -- sat inside a Starbucks, sipping coffee and drying out their feet. ''The snow was nice,'' said one visitor, Tracey Mouncher. ''The slush is not so good.'' In Southampton on Long Island, the basements that flooded last week stayed dry, said one resident, Bob Zellner. Mr. Zellner said the waves, which pounded his home last Saturday, were much calmer yesterday. Mr. Miner, the meteorologist, said the rains would stop by this afternoon, but the fierce winds would persist. He said the precipitation would return midweek, but only as rain."
"ON a blustery day in mid-December, Chris Benchetler and his friends were trudging forward in line for the Thunder Bound Express chairlift at Mammoth Mountain in the eastern Sierras of California. Wearing oversize jackets and pants so voluminous that waistlines and inseams were mere suggestions, and headed for a terrain park where they looked forward to careering in and out of half-pipes, they were the very models of snowboard culture. Except for one thing: they were there to ski. Mr. Benchetler, 17, and his friends are in the forefront of a growing trend in snow sports known as freeskiing or ''new-school skiing,'' which is breathing new and lucrative life into the struggling ski industry. Using skis known as twin-tips, which are designed so skiers can move backward and forward down mountains, freeskiers borrow both the creative moves of snowboarding, using obstacles like rails and stumps for tricks, and, more important, something of its renegade image. ''The level of skiing is almost equal with snowboarding now,'' said Mr. Benchetler, who has been freeskiing for five years and sports shoulder-length hair that curls up under his hat and goggles. ''And the style of clothing and even the graphics on skis are cool now,'' he added. In the six years since the first pair of twin-tip skis were introduced by Salomon, new-school skiers have been reclaiming status and mountain space lost to snowboarders. Resort managers and ski instructors from Whistler-Blackcomb in British Columbia to Stratton Mountain in Vermont say they are transforming the scene on the slopes. ''There are more and more young skiers in our terrain park each year,'' said Oren Tanzer the terrain park manager at Mammoth. ''Skiing was in decline, and now there are almost just as many of them out there as snowboarders.'' According to SnowSports Industries America, a national trade group, the number of twin-tip skis sold (usually for more than $500 a pair), shot up 65 percent last season to 23,000 over the previous winter. ''We are starting to see a lot of these freeski brands get traction with customers 30 years old and under,'' said Ira Rosh, the divisional merchandise manager of Paragon Sports, the largest sporting goods store in Manhattan. ''Twin-tip ski and freeski apparel sales are already stronger than last year.'' Freeskiing has also spawned its own magazines, like Freeskier and Freeze. ''We have seen more change in the ski industry in the past 12 months than we have in the past 20 years,'' said Brad Fayfield, the editor and publisher of Freeskier, whose circulation has increased to 100,000 since 2002. ''If our magazine's growth is an indicator, then the ski industry is in for an epic ride.'' And freeskiing is fast gaining legitimacy as a competitive sport. Last year, it was included in world cup competition for the first time. And the sport is aiming for an invitation to the 2010 Olympic Games. It has been a long time coming for Mike Douglas, known as the godfather of new-school skiing. In 1997, Mr. Douglas, a Canadian freestyle skier, was coaching the Canadian Freestyle Ski team when he and four of his skiers began doing tricks in snowboarders' half-pipes. (Not to be confused with freeskiing, freestyle skiing is an Olympic sport involving acrobatic jumping and mogul skiing.) But the Canadians' single-tipped skis kept them from pushing as far as they wanted to go. At the time, ski manufacturers were focusing much of their energies on snowboarding, which for years had been gaining ground on skiing. Between 1993 and 1998 the number of alpine skiers had dropped by 13 percent as the number of snowboarders doubled. (Since then, skiing participation has continued to drop, from 10.5 million in 1997 to 7.4 million in 2003, while the number of snowboarders surged by more than 50 percent, from 3.7 million to 5.6 million, mostly among those under 24.) Ski loyalists, meanwhile, who wanted to depart from the standard downhill and mogul trails, were barred from the half-pipes and jumps in what were then called snowboard parks. Not surprisingly, the rapport between snowboarders and skiers was tense. ''We had become the ugly stepchild of the new action-sports scene,'' Mr. Douglas said. Afraid that the evolution of skiing might come to a permanent halt, in August, 1997, Mr. Douglas put together a video documenting the moves he and his friends had perfected on skis and drafted a proposal for the construction of a fatter, softer ski that could withstand landings, with a turned-up tip in both the front and back for skiing and landing backwards. (Twin-tip skis are 151 to 181 centimeters long, 60 to 71 inches.) After sending the package to every major ski company, only Salomon, a company known for its trendsetting innovations, wanted in. The result was the Teneighty, the first twin-tip ski, which reached the market in February 1998 and officially started the freeski movement. ''The Teneighty was not just a leap in technology,'' said Hal Thomson, the communications manager of Salomon North America, ''but a cultural movement that may be the biggest evolution ever in skiing.'' Within a year, competing ski and snowboard makers began producing twin-tips of their own, and both Freeze and Freeskiing magazines were started. It was not until last January, however, that new-school skiing gained wide-scale notice and respect, when a French freeskier named Candide Thovex sailed more than 20 feet off the ground in the half-pipe competition at the 2003 Winter X Games. To indicate just what a feat that was, ESPN compared his run with that of Shaun White, the snowboard superpipe gold medalist. At times, Mr. Thovex had soared a full four feet higher out of the half-pipe. ''The minute Candide dropped in, you knew he was taking skiing to a new place,'' said Salema Masekela, the events commentator and a snowboarder. ''I have never seen anyone go that big in the pipe.'' Skiing's new highs have attracted both alpine skiers and snowboarders. Many of the early converts were people like Justin Todd, 22, a skier all his life. Since new-school skiing didn't really exist at his local mountain in Montana, he didn't see his first pair of twin-tips until he saw freeskiing in a video four years ago. ''Freeskiing is just more fun,'' said Mr. Todd, who moved to California to have better access to the terrain park at Mammoth. ''I am not getting burnt out by it because there are always new tricks to be done. At Mammoth, a skier not on twin-tip skis is likely an adult.'' In lesser numbers, snowboarders have been swapping their boards for skis. Craig Coker, 19, who began snowboarding when he was 6, took up freeskiing after watching it in the 1999 Winter X Games. ''I liked that skiing felt so different,'' said Mr. Coker, who also now lives near Mammoth Mountain. ''And that I didn't need to change the way I dressed or leave the park.'' Even professional snowboarders have been stepping onto skis. Mr. Thomson of Salomon said the company has received a surprising number of requests for skis this season from its professional snowboard team. ''When you spend as many days of the year snowboarding as I do, it's fun to mix it up,'' one of the athletes, Jason Ford, said. ''You change the platform you're on, and the mountain changes too.'' And so have lift-line politics. Skiers and snowboarders now huddle together, their clothes almost indistinguishable, their iPods loaded with the same music. ''Freeskiers share the same lifestyle, culture and reason for being on the hill as snowboarders,'' Mr. Fayfield said. In short, it is now the thing your parents don't do. ''It's become the counterculture,'' said Finlay Torrance, Mammoth's sports school manager. ''I am seeing kids who are 10, an age when they typically take up snowboarding, graduating from our ski school wanting to keep skiing.'' Freeskiing's next generation is now one-upping the jaw-dropping moves pioneered by people like Mr. Douglas, both in terrain parks and in the backcountry, where they are launching themselves over 120-foot gaps: just wider than the wingspan of a 727 plane. All this before they are old enough to drink. Beginning Jan. 27 in Aspen, Colo., spectators for the 2004 Winter X Games can expect to see the caliber of freeskiing leap ahead once more. ''People are going to be blown away by the freeskiers this year,'' said Mr. Fayfield, who has been charting the moves of the sport's newest stars in his magazine. And for the first time, the games will be broadcast live, on ESPN. Skiers are certainly embracing new tribal bragging rights. The ski maker Line has made ''I am a Skier'' T-shirts. ''Ten years ago a kid would be embarrassed to be a skier,'' said Jason Levinthal, the company's founder and president, who began building twin-tip skis in his garage in 1995. ''The T-shirt is a way of saying I am proud to be a skier.'' Correction: January 4, 2004, Sunday Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about freeskiing, a style influenced by snowboarding, misstated the starting date for this year's Winter X Games, which include freeskiing events. It is Jan. 24; Jan. 27 is the closing date of the Games."
"MOUNTING snow tires at the rear of the family car was once an annual ritual. Today, though, most cars soldier through the year without a moment's thought given to seasonal tire changes. Nearly forgotten, too, are the no-nonsense snow tires of years past that confronted slippery roads with beefy blocks of rubber divided by deep grooves in the tread. Seemingly poised to claw a path through the worst indignities that winter could dish out, those aggressive-looking tires are now used mostly by off-road adventurers. A number of developments brought about these changes. The auto industry's transition to radial tires from bias-ply designs during the 1970's began the shift. Later, the introduction of tires carrying an all-season M+S rating (for mud and snow duty) further reined in the urge of car owners to fit snow tires every autumn. Then the arrival of a new generation of smaller cars all but sealed the fate of the traditional snow tire. ''Front-wheel drive completes a pretty good package for winter driving,'' said Bob Toth, a marketing manager at Goodyear Tire & Rubber. Recent mild winters in many areas, along with the rising popularity of four-wheel-drive light trucks and the increasing availability of all-wheel-drive systems in luxury cars, family sedans and minivans, hasn't reinvigorated the traditional snow tire, either. The downside, though, is that four-wheel-drive systems -- often aided by electronic traction control -- can give drivers a false sense of security, enabling them to churn through the snow while others are stuck spinning their wheels. But finding enough traction to get moving from a standstill doesn't repeal the laws of physics: changing direction or stopping demands a good grip of the road, a lesson many drivers learn only after depositing their vehicle in a snowbank. Improvements in drive systems have not eliminated the need for specialized winter tires. ''We use the analogy of shoes,'' said Matt Edmonds, vice president for marketing atthe Tire Rack, a high-volume retailer in South Bend, Ind. ''For running, we have special shoes, and for stomping around in the snow, we put on boots.'' Tire makers employ a variety of techniques to improve the performance of winter tires. Some are carryovers from traditional designs: deep tread grooves help the tire to sling out snow accumulated in the tread, presenting a clean gripping surface on the tire's next revolution. Wide voids -- the open spaces between the tread blocks -- expose a greater surface area of the tread lugs to the snow, enabling them to dig through accumulated powder in search of traction. For that reason, manufacturers recommend replacement at deeper tread depths than summer tires to maintain full effectiveness in snow conditions. Winter tires are designed to provide added mechanical grip through the use of small channels, called sipes, cut into the tread surface. The sipes provide an escape route for water, which can be present even at very low temperatures because the relatively warm tires (heated by natural flexing as they roll) melt a small amount of the snow. The sipes also distort under the pressure of acceleration and braking, leaning over like a tipped row of dominoes to expose a series of gripping edges. Some winter tires incorporate friction material within the tread itself. Tire makers have experimented with coiled wire, sawdust and even crushed walnut shells. Goodyear and Michelin, among others, use silica grit in the rubber compound, aiming to achieve the same benefit as spreading sand on a slippery road. Another tire maker, Bridgestone, uses a tread technology it calls ''tubular microcell compound'' in its line of Blizzak winter tires. A network of microscopic pores throughout the tread rubber -- not unlike the holes in a block of Swiss cheese -- are formed during the manufacturing process. These openings, along with the sipes, whisk away the thin water boundary on the road surface to improve grip. More microcells are exposed as the tire wears, keeping grip constant. Tires rated as the best performers in snow are identified by a symbol molded into the sidewall that depicts a snowflake inside the profile of a mountain. The rating standard, developed by the American Society for Testing and Materials, is based on a traction test performed on packed snow. Tires certified to the ''severe'' snow condition standard provide greater traction in snow than tires with the M+S rating of an all-season tire, and are vastly superior in snow to high performance summer tires. ''Too often people choose a snow tire by how aggressive it looks,'' said Mr. Toth of Goodyear. But a good winter tire must remain pliable at lower temperatures; since ice is a microcrystalline structure, staying flexible allows the tire to grip what little roughness it has. Studs imbedded in the tire tread were once considered the ultimate in ice traction -- and some experts still feel that way -- though new winter tires approach the same levels of grip. In tests performed on an ice rink by the Tire Rack, Bridgestone's Blizzak winter tires actually provided greater traction than studded tires. Studded tires are illegal in many states, or their use is limited to winter months. Old-fashioned tire chains may provide the highest level of snow traction, but should be used only in deep snow and removed immediately when the roads are clear. Many current cars, particularly those with front-wheel drive, do not have enough fender clearance for chains. Check the owner's manual for specific recommendations. Experts recommend that when installing winter tires, a narrower tread width should be chosen. ''A wide performance tire wants to ride up on the snow,'' Mr. Toth said, ''but a narrower tire will cut through down to the pavement.'' Regardless of the brand and model of winter tire chosen, experts recommend that they be installed on all four wheels. On four-wheel-drive vehicles, slight differences in rolling diameter can cause all-wheel drive systems to sense wheel slip even when none exists. That causes strain on the system and tires, shortening the life of both. Whether a car has front, rear, all-wheel or four-wheel drive, it is necessary to match winter tires to maintain a balance in traction between the front and rear of the car. With unmatched tires, Mr. Edmonds said, ''a car has a split personality, with one end well connected to the ground and the other not at all.'' Finally, drivers should remember that getting going doesn't mean being able to turn corners or stop short, as many sport utility owners have learned to their chagrin. Mr. Toth said that antilock brakes ''can only get to the peak'' of available traction, noting that stopping may take much longer than when driving in ideal conditions. ''We have an old saying,'' he said, ''Brakes stop your wheels, but tires stop your car.'' Autos on Monday | Technology"
"IOWA, like many states, once had a system for dispatching highway snowplows and salt trucks that had an obvious shortcoming. ''We would wait until we received a phone call from the sheriff's department or local police saying that they've got a lot of cars in the ditch,'' said Dennis Burkheimer, the winter operations administrator for the Iowa Department of Transportation. Fortunately for the state's motorists, the road-clearing system has long since evolved. Today 53 supervisors weigh a variety of factors and try to begin clearing and salting highways before snow and ice become a menace. Last winter, however, three of those supervisors went one step further. They tested a prototype software system that combines data from specially created weather forecasts, readings from roadside weather stations as well as in-road sensors to recommend when the trucks should be dispatched. The system even tosses in advice on how the drivers should do their jobs. Iowa is running a second round of tests on an improved version of the system this winter. But Mr. Burkheimer said the software, formally known as the Winter Road Maintenance Decision Support System, had already shown that it might reduce costs, increase road safety and limit environmental damage from salt and other chemicals. ''It's a work in progress,'' Mr. Burkheimer said. ''But the supervisors felt that it had some great potential.'' The weather forecasting system in the United States has long catered to the needs of airplane pilots. But that same level of attention has not been given to road and other surface transportation users, despite their greater numbers and higher accident rates, said William P. Mahoney III, a project manager at the National Center for Atmospheric Research who is supervising the development of the road-clearing software. ''The United States is way, way behind Japan and Northern Europe,'' he said. ''The amount of goods and services that move across the country means that the weather impact to travel is a big economic hit.'' For road crews, one problem with most weather forecasting is its scope. Mr. Mahoney said that local National Weather Service forecasts for non-urban areas generally cover a large territory -- a square that is about 40 miles on each side. Highway maintenance crews, however, need an accurate forecast for about 10 to 15 miles of road, the typical length of a snowplow's run. ''To get down to that we're absolutely pushing the envelope,'' Mr. Mahoney said. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which runs the weather service and is a participant in the highway project, is using more powerful computers to create more finely detailed forecasts. But meeting the needs of road crews has also involved gathering more localized weather and road condition data. That task has fallen to miniature roadside weather stations that can provide information like the pavement's temperature and whether it is wet or dry. Mr. Mahoney estimates that there are 2,000 of these roadside stations in the United States, including 51 in Iowa. The devices are more common in some other countries. In Canada, for example, the government announced plans in late August to join roadside weather stations along highways into a nationwide network. But some cities also use them along local roads to help with municipal road clearing. ''The regular weather forecast only gives you air temperature,'' said Luc Marineau, an operations engineer for the City of Ottawa, which has 10 stations of varying capabilities. ''But the key to winter maintenance operations is pavement temperature.'' All of Ottawa's stations give pavement temperature, and embedded sensors also indicate the state of the road surface -- indicating, for example, if the pavement is dry or covered with a slush that contains ice-melting chemicals. Environment Canada, the government agency responsible for weather forecasting, uses data from the stations to create pavement temperature forecasts for Ottawa. If the forecasts indicate that the road surface temperature is likely to stay above freezing during a light snowstorm, for example, Mr. Marineau said, the city's salt trucks will stay parked. Conversely, if the forecast predicts falling road surface temperatures while pavement sensors show that melted ice has diluted salt that was applied earlier, clearing crews are quickly dispatched. Iowa's test project is more ambitious. To further refine the accuracy of its forecasts, data about the characteristics of individual roads and their surroundings are included in the software model. ''National scale models are not going to know where there's a low spot in a road,'' Mr. Mahoney said. The test system does more than just provide a forecast. It also make recommendations on the most effective road-clearing treatments for different weather situations, down to the rate at which trucks should apply salt or other de-icing chemicals. The advice feature may get around a growing problem for some states. As experienced employees retire, many state highway departments are losing snowplowing and ice-clearing expertise, Mr. Mahoney said. At the same time, he added, ''a lot of new plow drivers see the job only as a temporary one'' and develop few skills. During last winter's test, Mr. Burkheimer said, his dispatchers often disagreed with the salting and sanding recommendations of the software. For this winter's tests, those suggestions have been revised partly with advice from Iowa's crews. But like most people, Mr. Burkheimer still has a common lament. With the system so dependent on accurate information, he said, ''the weather forecasting needs improvement.'' Two factors seem to have caused unexpected problems last year. The National Weather Service, Mr. Burkheimer said, generally doesn't pay much attention to very light rain or snowfall. ''But once you put a layer of ice crystals on a highway, you need to go out and treat it,'' he said. The researchers also were surprised by the great inaccuracy of snowfall measurements by the weather service. At one point, Mr. Burkheimer said, researchers measured 13 inches of snow in Des Moines, but a weather service measuring device reported that the snow had ''zero liquid equivalent.'' ''It surprises me that nobody has been yelling and screaming about this for years,'' Mr. Burkheimer said. Iowa is only a beginning test for the road-clearing software -- and perhaps an easy one at that. After further refinement, the system will undergo trials in a mountainous state. ''When you have roads snaking through different altitudes and in and out of the sun and canyons, there are special challenges,'' Mr. Burkheimer said. WHAT'S NEXT"
"Everybody in the retail industry is talking about the weather. While snowstorms continue to wreak havoc with analysts' projections for the holiday shopping season, a few remain optimistic. Faced with two near-blizzards that struck the last two weekends and a northeaster forecast for later today, Scott Krugman, a spokesman for the National Retail Federation, took a temperate tone. ''The forecast for the coming weekend,'' he said, ''is great, only a few clouds.'' He paused, then added, ''Nobody's canceling Christmas.'' But some are gloomier. Richard E. Jaffe, a retail analyst with UBS, was drafting a report yesterday on the negative effect of the storms. Mr. Jaffe said the snowstorms the last two weekends had cost the nation's retailers more than 1 percent of total sales for the holiday season. The NPD Group, a market research firm, projects a 1.5 percent reduction in sales by retailers because of the storms. As of yesterday, estimates for holiday sales were for an increase of 3 percent to 5.7 percent from last year's dismal performance. The higher figure comes from the retail federation. ''If there's another snowstorm this weekend, because it's so close to Christmas it could knock as much as 4 percent off -- putting the holiday into the red compared with last year,'' said Marshal Cohen, a senior analyst with NPD, which has already lowered its estimate to growth of 3.5 percent from 5 percent before Thanksgiving. Mr. Cohen is also writing a report on the effect of snowstorms on retailing, titled ''Bad Weather Translates to Lost Sales.'' Most big department store chains remained silent yesterday. ''We don't comment on sales, trends or weather patterns,'' said Julia Bentley, a spokeswoman for Saks Inc., which owns Saks Fifth Avenue. But Kenneth S. Lakin, chief executive of Boscov's, the largest family-owned department store chain in the country, was more forthcoming. ''The snow was terrible,'' he said. Boscov's was hoping for a 5 percent gain for the holiday season in its 40 stores, in Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, compared with last holiday season. ''We've knocked it down to zero to 3 percent,'' he said. ''We'll never be able to make up those days now.'' Mr. Lakin said that because of the snowfall on Presidents' Day in February, he had considered taking out blizzard insurance. ''But it was too expensive,'' he said. Stores at many Northeastern malls lost business as a result of the recent storms. Although the first one was more like a blizzard, with deep snow and some malls closing, merchants said it had less effect than the second one because it occurred further away from Dec. 25. ''The one this past Sunday was so disappointing because the weekdays and Saturday had been so great,'' said Karen MacDonald, a spokeswoman for Taubman Centers, which own 31 malls in 13 states. ''It really hurt.'' Sales at the Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey had been ''trending up for the week,'' she said, and now retailers estimate last week's sales to be ''flat to slightly below last year's level.'' But others disagree -- at least about which winter storm weekend was worse. ''Obviously, the storm that affected both Friday and Saturday was the bigger hit to the business,'' said Michael Gould, chief executive of Bloomingdale's. ''It was an enormous hit to the plan.'' On Saturday, Dec. 6, stores in New Jersey, Westchester County and on Long Island all closed early, he said. But the next week, he said, ''sales were spectacular and made everybody's plans back, plus some.'' Then there was Sunday's storm: ''A tough day,'' he said, ''just ugly.'' Nevertheless, Mr. Gould said that Bloomingdale's -- at least until the northeaster hits -- is running ''fractionally above plan.'' Duncan Simester, a professor of marketing at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that the stores should have been more careful about what they wished for. ''Some department stores were hoping for an early snow, so they could sell jackets and coats, but they would have liked it on a Tuesday,'' he said. ''They didn't want it on a weekend, and they certainly didn't want it on two weekends.'' Snow can be good, said Heidi Weaver, a spokeswoman for Marshall Field's, the Midwest department store chain with the Chicago flagship, although she said she noticed no particular increase in business because of the most recent weather, which dropped ''a couple of inches of snow'' yesterday. ''Out here, when the weather is bad, it can actually help,'' Ms. Weaver said. ''People spend longer hours shopping, and make a day of it. We're used to this.'' Mr. Lakin of Boscov's was less cheerful. ''How could anyone think a 10-inch, 134-year record snowfall would be good for business?'' he said. ''It knocked the wind out of our projections. It was a killer.'' But retailers, in order to survive, say they must be optimists. And like Mr. Krugman, Mr. Lakin said he had not heard the news about the northeaster, which is forecast to begin today. ''Our forecasts show clear weather for the next 15 days,'' he said."
"While many roads in the metropolitan area were slippery and treacherous on Saturday, the roads in the Town of Yorktown, in northern Westchester County, had but a thin layer of blue slush, thanks to an innovative method of spraying roadways before a storm with a solution of liquefied salt. Plows and sand spreaders in Yorktown were parked in the Highway Department's yard on Saturday morning, and their drivers stood in the garage smiling and looking out at the falling snow. The biggest smile belonged to Yorktown's highway superintendent, Eric DiBartolo, who created the method of de-icing the 200 miles of roadways that wind through the town's 48 square miles. Mr. DiBartolo brags of having only a high school education, but he has used the salty science of de-icing to clear roads, and a political path for himself in Yorktown. In the town, the highway superintendent's job is an elected position. And while failing to clear snowy streets can doom a political career, solving the ice problem can make one. Mr. DiBartolo, 42, was first elected in 1996 and has rolled to victory in two subsequent elections, he said, despite being a conservative Republican in a town that is predominantly Democratic. ''This is Westchester, and the last thing these people want is inconvenience,'' he explained. ''You have to be able to keep their roads as black in the winter as they are in the summer.'' Another pressure is ecological. The Town of Yorktown, about 25 miles north of the Bronx, lies in the New York City watershed, so any road runoff can add to the contamination of the reservoirs and streams that feed the city's water system. Mr. DiBartolo said that when he took over, the town was de-icing roads with sand, which was blocking up catch basins and storm drains and clogging local streams. He began spreading rock salt crystals, a method used by most municipalities, but the runoff began killing roadside vegetation. While traveling out West, Mr. DiBartolo saw roads being de-iced by trucks spraying a liquid salt solution. Back home, he began experimenting with brine solutions, dissolving salt granules in vats of water and custom-building trucks to spray it on the roads. Now he boasts that Yorktown's fleet of 17 sprayer trucks constitutes the cutting edge of de-icing systems in the Northeast. He watches the weather forecast and then pre-sprays the roads. Once applied, the brine solution prevents ice from forming until the road is plowed. The solution remains on the surface, and, after the first few snowfalls, the roads become coated with several layers of salt, making them almost impervious to ice, he said. ''Two hours into any snowstorm and my guys are in here having coffee, resting up for when things really get bad,'' Mr. DiBartolo said. ''When enough snow accumulates, we plow. But it never gets that slippery. I sprayed before the rush hour on Friday, so now we don't have to keep chasing the snow.'' A ton of salt that has been liquefied can treat four times as much surface, Mr. DiBartolo said. He is constantly tinkering with his saline solution, which freezes naturally at 4 degrees. To lower the freezing level, he adds a magnesium solution, which brings the freezing point to 34 below zero. He dissolves a light blue dye in the saline solution to show which streets have been salted and to serve as ''proof'' to cut down on complaints from residents and lawsuits resulting from accidents. Most of the sprayer trucks have mud flaps with a ''N.Y. City'' insignia. The trucks are former city maintenance dump trucks bought at auctions at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Mr. DiBartolo said he is such a steady customer that the city runs a tab for him. Once Mr. DiBartolo buys a vehicle, often for less than $2,000, his crews customize it by mounting a large plastic tank on the bed and a Honda 5.5 horsepower gas engine to pump the solution by hose to a spray bar with several valves installed on the back. Each truck has an electronic sensor to measure the temperature of the road surface, which can often be colder than the air. ''Hey, times are tough, you got to be creative,'' Mr. DiBartolo said. ''A new Mack dump truck can cost you $130,000. I get them from the city for a couple grand that runs fine.'' And it costs 7.5 cents a gallon to make the salt solution, he said, far cheaper than rock salt ($24.23 a ton) or sand (about $15 a ton). A PREWINTER SNOW: COPING"
"The finale of a powerful two-day storm roared across the New York metropolitan area and played out over the Northeast yesterday, burying parts of the region in more than a foot of snow that set a record, slowed travel, challenged Christmas shoppers and transformed the landscape into vistas as uncluttered as early maps of America. The marathon snowstorm, a 450-mile-wide galaxy swirling counterclockwise on the satellite pictures and a thing of awesome beauty on the ground, was the biggest on record for early December in New York, and it packed the wallop of heavy-duty winter blows more typical of January and February. Striking two weeks before the onset of winter, the classic Northeaster gathered strength as it drove up the coast, engulfing 12 states from Virginia and Pennsylvania through the Northeast Corridor into New England. At times, snow fell at a rate of more than an inch an hour. At airports from Washington and Philadelphia to New York and Boston, it whited out runways, forced scores of flight delays and cancellations and snared thousands of travelers. It buried small streets in hundreds of communities, cut visibility and speeds on highways and made travel treacherous and miserable. Across the region, hundreds of traffic accidents on ice-slicked highways and at least four deaths -- two in New Jersey and one each in Connecticut and Pennsylvania -- were attributed to the storm. By evening, accumulations on central Long Island had reached 18 inches, and 20 inches in Thornwood, Westchester County. In New Jersey the snow had reached 15 inches in Newark, 12.5 inches in Passaic County and 13 inches in Bergen County. Baltimore had 5 inches and Philadelphia 11 inches. In Connecticut, Darien had 9, Cos Cob 11.5 and Meriden 9.5 inches. Providence, R.I., reported 10 inches, and New Bedford, Mass., 9.5 inches. Some additional accumulation was expected. In New York City, the totals for the two-day storm were 16 inches in Riverdale in the Bronx, 12 inches at La Guardia Airport, 12 at Kennedy Airport and 13 inches in Central Park. The park is often used as a microcosm of the city for weather records, and the snowfall there was the greatest for early December since accurate record-keeping began, said Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. ''Since 1900 in New York, there has never been a snowstorm of this magnitude this early,'' Mr. Miner said. The city's biggest December snowstorm was the two-day blizzard of Dec. 26-27, 1947, he noted. Daytime temperatures peaked in the 20's across the region, and winds cranked up to 35 miles an hour, with gusts to 50. Ocean winds off Massachusetts and Rhode Island hit 45 to 60 miles an hour, the Coast Guard said. Boaters were warned off. Getting around the region was difficult at best. By early afternoon, the traffic on many highways in New Jersey and Connecticut, on Long Island and along the Southern Tier of New York had slowed to a crawl. Scores of accidents were reported, but most were minor. Just after 1 p.m., a car heading south on Third Avenue in Brooklyn plunged into the Gowanus Canal, the police said. The couple inside were not seriously hurt and were rescued by firefighters. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said hundreds of flights were canceled -- 80 to 90 percent of the airlines' schedules -- at La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports, and most flights ran three hours late. Metro-North, the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit ran trains that were mostly on time, though passenger loads were light, spokesmen said. City subways ran on schedule, but buses had more difficulty, and some were late. Amtrak trains in the Northeast Corridor ran on or close to schedule. Consolidated Edison reported no power failures in the five boroughs and Westchester. But 200 customers of the Long Island Power Authority lost power, most of them in the Riverhead area of Suffolk County. Despite the conditions, the snow conjured up a holiday mood for thousands of tourists and shoppers in New York and across the region. Suburban malls and city emporiums were crowded with shoppers, and thousands of sightseers flocked to St. Patrick's Cathedral, Fifth Avenue and Rockefeller Center to see the Christmas tree and the million lights shining through the falling snow. The Rockefeller Center ice rink under the gaze of golden Prometheus was filled with skaters, including one agile Santa. They whirled in a great spiral, silver blades flashing on the edge like comets. Elsewhere in Midtown, crowds coiled at the corners of Macy's and other department stores, sidewalk Santas rang their bells and Christmas music wafted from loudspeakers as people lined up at velvet ropes to see the animated window displays, winking lights, the toys, wreaths and diamond brooches. Across the Northeast, basketball games, horse racing cards, SAT tests and other events were canceled or postponed. But on Broadway, the shows went on. None were canceled, according to the League of American Theatres and Producers, although some theatergoers were deterred. In Prospect Park in Brooklyn, joggers, cross-country skiers, sledders and bird-watchers were out in the storm, along with a group of Russians performing aerobic exercises. ''The snow makes us happy,'' said Natalie Vassersteim, 56. ''It reminds us of our country and when we were younger.'' Kevin Rolwing, 46, on skis and bird-watching at Prospect Lake, noted that the ringbilled gulls were all crouched in formation, facing the wind. ''The ruddy ducks are here,'' he said, surveying the flocks. ''The northern shoveler hasn't come in yet.'' In Central Park, children frolicked in the drifts with sleds and snowboards, tottering inspirations from Chaplin or Keaton. And in the frail December light there were glimpses of subtle beauty: the dark bare Japanese-print branches looped and netted, snowflakes glittering like jewels in the windy air and in the distance the gray towers of Manhattan brooding like chessmen. On the park's Sheep Meadow, a dozen men played a fierce football game in the snow. ''It's fun,'' said Ethan Jamron, 23. ''And it doesn't hurt if you get tackled.'' Along the coasts of New Jersey and Long Island, breakers thundered on the beaches. At Long Beach on Long Island, a few surfers embraced 15-foot waves as high winds blew snow horizontally and seagulls hunched down. ''There's no such thing as bad weather,'' said David Garfinkel, 43, peering from a hooded wetsuit, his face chapped to the color of raw tuna. Forecasters had predicted that the first storm of the season would be big, and they were right. It came in two waves. The first struck on Friday with blowing snow that seemed to defy gravity and bullying winds that moaned like Letterkenny banshees. It closed schools early, forced flight cancellations, disrupted highway and rail travel and knocked out power for thousands. But armies of snowplows and salt spreaders were out around the clock, and an overnight lull in the snowfall allowed time to catch up. Most of New York's major arteries, and the latticework of highways across the metropolitan area, were cleared as the region braced for the sequel, which began at midmorning yesterday and was even more impressive. Forecasters predicted snow accumulations, by the storm's end, of up to two feet in Massachusetts, 20 inches in Pennsylvania, and 15 inches in Connecticut. In the city, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg rolled out his own numbers to show how smoothly things were going: 6,000 miles of city roads and highways plowed and sanded, 2,100 sanitation workers on 12-hour shifts pushing 1,924 pieces of equipment, including 1,300 plows and 355 salt spreaders. ''The city's open,'' the mayor declared. ''Broadway is open, the movie theaters are open, the restaurants are open.'' Buffalo, a city known for bravery in the face of blizzards, was also open. ''We got missed,'' said Kevin O'Hara, a meteorologist. ''It's not that we're gloating,'' said Gerry Gutauskas, a resident of Hamburg, a Buffalo suburb. ''But it's nice to see someone else getting it.'' A PREWINTER SNOW: THE OVERVIEW"
"This is the winter when more snow fell in this town than anywhere else in New York State, when construction equipment was needed to clear driveways, when children turned their houses into sledding hills, and when roofs buckled -- but not the people beneath them. ''The snow started and it just kept coming,'' said Susan M. Fox, a third-grade teacher and volunteer medic for the local fire department. ''It's the worst I've ever seen.'' She was talking not about a single storm but about the month of January, when snow seemed to fall continuously, leaving banks taller than a college basketball player. By Jan. 31, Parish had recorded more than 19 feet of snow for the winter, making the town the state's snow capital, according to data collected by volunteers for the National Weather Service. ''That's because of our good friend Lake Ontario,'' said Maureen McCann, a meteorologist with WTVH, the CBS affiliate in Syracuse, which is about 25 miles south of Parish. ''There was a persistent wind pattern that drew snow from the whole length of Lake Ontario. I think Parish is the big winner.'' Usually, the worst lake-effect snow lands in the Tug Hill plateau, a stretch of land between the lake and the Adirondack Mountains not too far from Parish. Residents in that extremely remote area take pride that Tug Hill averages more snowfall than any place east of the Mississippi. ''If Parish had more snow this year, it would be the first time in 100 years,'' insisted Michael G. Yerdon Sr., vice chairman of the Tug Hill Commission, even though National Weather Service data showed his town, Redfield, and others in the Tug Hill region received two feet less snow than Parish by Jan. 31 this winter. Parish residents did not have to look to the statistics to prove what their community has been living with for weeks. ''You put your clothes on in the morning and go out and shovel,'' said Judy Phillips, a school secretary. ''Shovel when you go home from work. Shovel before you go to bed. And shovel again the next morning to get out of the driveway.'' Not to mention the necessity of shoveling off the roof. Lori Grist discovered that when she came home from work one day recently to find the porch roof collapsed on her stately 1890 Queen Anne- Victorian home in the center of town. ''It's kind of depressing,'' she said. Ms. Grist's friends had helped her shovel the roof before the porch collapsed, but they hadn't been able to catch up with a couple of strong storms at the end of January. She said her insurance agency told her it had received so many claims, it had declared the damage catastrophic without visiting her home. Earlier this month, Gov. George E. Pataki requested federal relief money for four snow-stricken counties -- Oneida, Lewis, Cayuga and Oswego, which includes Parish. ''There's a couple vehicles right there,'' said Ms. Grist's brother, John Grist, pointing to a mound of white at the end of the driveway. ''The van and the S.U.V. are buried.'' But residents are proving to be as hardy as the weather pattern. ''I love the snow,'' said Mrs. Fox. ''I happily shovel.'' A few grumbles aside -- about annoyances like the inability to keep a dog in the backyard because the snowbanks are taller than the fences -- most people say they relish the feeling of being a survivor. Stories about the community's taking care of its own abound. Nearly two weeks after those storms, Ms. Grist's friends are still coming over, climbing a ladder, throwing a rope around themselves and cleaning off other parts of the roof to avert more damage. Next door, where John Grist lives with their ailing father, the driveway had been cleared -- not with a snowblower, but with a friend's construction equipment. ''I love this community,'' Ms. Grist said. ''I wouldn't consider moving.'' The schools have been closed for only five days because of snow, half the snow days of most other places in the state, according to Mrs. Phillips. Grocery stores usually do not run out of food because people keep their pantries well stocked in the winter and feel no need to hoard. ''It's nothing we can't handle,'' said David Chapman, owner of the town's 24-hour diner, the Grist Mill, just off Interstate 81. When the last storm hit, Mr. Chapman plowed ''around the clock'' to keep his business open, he said. Then he let stranded travelers stay in their booths as long as they needed, and never had to ask the truck drivers to move their rigs so he could plow near them, for they did it on their own. When the regulars came in to eat, he asked if they wanted avalanche seating as he pointed to the windows, where the view was mostly blocked by the drifts. ''It's the community we live in, and it gets a lot of snow,'' he said. That's just why Daniel Keppler and his friend Michael Lewis from Vernon, N.J., visited here recently. Where better than Parish to run their snowmobiles? ''In New Jersey, if we got three to four inches, they'd be going nuts,'' Mr. Keppler said. ''They get 79 inches here and it's like nothing to them.'' But there is no sense of superiority, at least not from Harold D. Kinney, who is said to be the town's snow guru. He plows for a living, takes measurements with a yardstick to satisfy his own curiosity, and is quoted in the local newspaper whenever a reporter needs to know something about snow. Coping with snow is hard, no matter how little you get, he said. ''How do I feel when New York City gets five or six inches? I feel sorry for them,'' he said earnestly. ''I know what it's like; it's the same here when we get five to six feet.'' Parish Journal"
"LAST winter, the New York City Department of Sanitation issued about 9,000 summonses to property owners who failed to shovel their sidewalks after snowstorms. Over a five-day period last month -- Jan. 19 through Jan. 23 -- the department issued 6,908 such summonses in the aftermath of just one storm. And while officials deny that any ''ticket blitz'' is under way, the message is nevertheless clear: keep your sidewalk clear of ice and snow. In suburbia, that may mean hauling out heavy equipment like plows and snow throwers. In the city, though, for most property owners, more conventional equipment is employed: the old-fashioned snow shovel. Not all snow shovels are created equal, however, and not all such tools are shovels. According to the National Retail Hardware Association, a trade organization based in Indianapolis, there are a number of different muscle-powered snow- and ice-removal tools available. The most common snow removal device, of course, is the snow shovel. ''The basic stock includes steel, aluminum and plastic snow shovels,'' said Walt Johnson, a spokesman for the association. Standard shovels made of steel, he said, typically have 14-inch-by-18-inch enamel-finished blades with 33-inch handles. Aluminum shovels are usually that size as well with steel wear straps -- metal strips at the leading edge of the blade. Plastic shovels, Mr. Johnson said, generally weigh less, with ribbed blades for extra strength. ''They shed snow easily and can be lower priced than metal shovels,'' he said. While most shovels designed for snow have wide flat blades, some have narrower blades with sides so they can be used for lifting and throwing wet heavy snow. Mr. Johnson noted that besides standard shovels, there are a number of newer designs available, including shovels with ergonomically designed shafts intended to reduce back strain. Another category of snow removal tool, he said, are snow pushers. ''Snow pushers are not designed for lifting and throwing snow,'' Mr. Johnson said, adding that instead, snow pushers typically have sharply curved blades designed to get snow out of the way by pushing it. ''There are even new designs in snow pushers,'' he said, referring to a product now being sold that adopts a design found on large snow plows. Instead of having a uniformly curved blade that pushes snow directly in front of it, the new design instead has a blade that is curved more sharply at one end, thereby moving the snow off to the side and allowing the pusher to make long, straight, continuous passes. Some such snow pushers even have wheels. All such devices, of course, rely upon the muscle power and endurance of the operator. And since most homeowners are not professional shovelers, they should do everything possible to maximize their efforts while minimizing the chance of, say, a heart attack. ''The most important things to remember are: use the right shovel for the job at hand and don't overdo it,'' said George Maher, a farm safety specialist at North Dakota State University in Fargo. For example, he said, a shovel needs to fit its operator. ''There's such a thing as a shovel that is too long or too short,'' he said, adding that ideally, the handle of the shovel should be such that the shovel can be used while the person using it is standing up fairly straight. ''You definitely don't want to shovel bent over,'' he said. In fact, he said, ergonomically designed shovels -- those that have an irregularly shaped shaft -- are generally designed so that they can be used without bending over. And shovels that have ''D'' handles at the end of the shaft are typically easier to use than those with just a straight end. ''The D handle makes it easier to control where you throw the snow than a pole handle,'' Mr. Maher said. He added that while plastic shovels are generally lighter and less expensive than steel and aluminum shovels, they may not be sturdy enough for heavy-duty snow removal. ''And I wouldn't use a plastic shovel to try to break up ice or frozen snow,'' he said. ''I'd be afraid that the blade could shatter.'' While ''pusher shovels'' can typically handle more snow than standard shovels -- because pushers do not require lifting -- there are limits to how much they can handle. ''You have to be careful to not get one that's too big,'' Mr. Maher said, adding that such shovels work best with no more than four inches of snow. Deeper snow ''will overload you and cause muscle problems later.'' In fact, he said, it generally makes sense to use a shovel or pusher with a smaller blade instead of a large one. And it is also more prudent -- during a prolonged snowfall -- to clear a manageable amount of snow a number of times rather than wait for the storm to end. ''This is based on the principal that you can do many light jobs better than you can do one or two heavy ones,'' Mr. Maher said. He added that regardless of what kind of tool is being used, it helps to ensure that snow does not stick to the blade. With newer shovels coated with a naturally slippery finish, sticking generally is not a problem. To avoid having snow stick to older or uncoated shovels, however, it may help to take the shovel indoors to warm it up, and then spray it with penetrating oil like WD-40. ''You can also use spray wax on a shovel blade to keep snow from sticking,'' he said. A relatively new addition to the homeowner's snow remover arsenal is the Masi Nova Snow Pusher. ''I love it,'' said Nicole Gay, manager of Towers Flowers in West Islip, N.Y. ''It's not heavy, not awkward, and it's easy on the back.'' Ms. Gay said that she just started using the shovel this year, and that it is much easier to use, and moves more snow, than ordinary shovels. The Masi Nova, which is manufactured by Motoseal, a company in Rauma, Finland, is a combination, of sorts, of a shovel and a pusher. (Picture a 31-inch-wide-by-26-inch-deep dustpan with high sloping sides, a high back and a U-shaped, baby-carriage-like handle attached at both sides.) Kari Tikkanen, the owner of Finn Smart/USA, the United States distributor of the Masi Nova in Babylon, N.Y., said the design of the shovel makes it possible to move large amounts of snow easily because the bottom of the shovel slides over the ground like a child's plastic sled. When the bucket is full, he said, the user just rotates the plastic bucket to one side or the other and dumps the snow. ''You never have to lift the shovel except to put it away,'' he said. (The shovel, which lists for $70, is available at primoshop.net) While removing the snow from the sidewalk might be enough to keep the Department of Sanitation's ticket writers at bay, it is typically also necessary to take some preventative steps to ensure that ice does not form after the snow has been cleared. And that can be accomplished with the judicious application of a deicer. ''There are basically five common deicers,'' said Greg MacDonnell, marketing manager for the Dow Chemical Company in Ludington, Mich. The most common deicing product, of course, is sodium chloride, commonly known as rock salt. The others are calcium chloride, urea, potassium chloride and magnesium chloride. While salt is relatively inexpensive, Mr. MacDonnell said, it is effective at melting snow and ice only when the temperature is about 20 degrees Fahrenheit or more. For potassium chloride and urea, he said, the practical limit at which they will work is about 25 degrees. Magnesium chloride and calcium chloride, on the other hand, will both work at lower temperatures. The practical limit of magnesium chloride is about zero degrees, and calcium chloride, about 28 degrees below zero. Glen Kotowski, general manager of North Shore Towers, a three-building 1,844-unit co-op in Floral Park, Queens, said his maintenance crew used calcium chloride to keep several acres of parking area and a couple of miles of sidewalk from freezing. To apply the deicer -- which can cause damage to grass -- his employees employ a tool typically used in fairer weather. ''You don't want to get calcium chloride on your grass,'' he said. ''So we use a fertilizer spreader with a shield to control distribution.'' YOUR HOME"
"WINTER is upon us. There have been record-breaking cold snaps, icy sidewalks and blizzards. Nobody wants to leave the apartment. And why should we? This is New York City, where anything can be ordered in. We are not the Donner party, you and me. Me especially. My assignment this last week, as the great blizzards threatened the city: Retreat to my cramped one-bedroom in Greenwich Village, with the office in the bedroom and the picturesque, but wobbly, junkyard pedestal sink, and attempt -- aided only by the phone book and the Internet -- to transform it into the Winter Palace. Does being a shut-in have to mean moo shu chicken and HBO? Or can I import the lush life? Do not, for once, be burdened by concerns about cash. Order in a masseuse, a hairdresser, a manicurist. Do not fret about missing the white sale at Bloomingdale's; ask the personal shopper to find you the sheets. Better yet, order silk pajamas. Turn cabin fever into caviar dreams. I have my own idea of the luxe winter life: curling up on the couch with a trashy book, a box of fancy chocolates and a nice fat cat. I don't happen to have a cat, but this is New York; I know of an animal talent agency -- I can rent. Five p.m. Tuesday, with WINS predicting 5 to 10 inches of snow, I am home. Provisions are scant: I am out of my most important food group, Caffeine Free Diet Pepsi. But in a town that delivers, that can be fixed. First order of business: Call Ariston Florist, just down the way on 14th Street. For a blizzard, they suggest lilies, roses and freesia -- maybe hyacinth. Damage: $175, plus $20 tip. Restocking the Diet Pepsi is not so easy: it's too late for Gristedes and the Jefferson Market to deliver. Things could get ugly if I do not get my Diet Pepsi; I could have my own little Donner party moment, I could become a Donnette. Still, who needs Diet Pepsi when you can call up Bouley or Le Cirque 2000 and have dinner delivered with the magic words, ''Money'' -- no, too crude, make that -- ''Cost is no object.'' That evening, with the heavy snow falling, I call Balthazar and request dinner for two in the West Village. ''Only Pastis delivers,'' they say. Sorry, Charlie, I love Pastis, but tonight it's going to be luxe. On to Bouley. ''We don't do that,'' they say. On to Le Cirque. ''Sorry,'' a man says, ''But we do not deliver dinners here.'' Big fat liar! I bet if your name is Kissinger. . . . The luxe life is getting to be very stressful. I call Bergdorf's and Bigelow's for bath oil, but at 6, it's too late for delivery today. No luck with a cat, either. The Dawn Animal Agency, which supplies animal actors, is manned by an answering service. Bide-a-Wee will not do a three-day loan. Getting my books in New York, however, will certainly be a snap. Barnes & Noble has posters all over the subway touting their same-day delivery service, with Shakespeare running down the street. I want Carrie Fisher's new book, ''The Best Awful,'' a roman _ clef about her failed marriage to a gay studio chief, and ''American Sucker,'' so I can feel smarter than David Denby, even though he writes for The New Yorker. I phone the closest Barnes & Noble, on Union Square. ''We don't deliver books from this store,'' a salesperson says. What about that picture of Shakespeare running down the street? ''That's 1-800-The-Book.'' That turns out to be the Internet division, but it's so confusing I'm not sure how fast anything will get here. My friend Lew, a media writer, will be here any minute for dinner. Pastis suddenly seems like a great idea. ''Twenty dollars for delivery,'' they tell me, ''the zone ends at Sixth Avenue.'' My apartment is between Fifth and Sixth, but why haggle? I order steak frites with b√©arnaise and fried chicken and chocolate mousse and a tarte Tatin. Damage: $126.50. Then I call Crossroads, my local wine store. The saleswoman, Suzanne Stevens, suggests a Ch√¢teau L√©oville Poyferr√© 1997, St. Julien, for $29.99, and a 1997 Lesec Hermitage red Rhone wine for $44.99. The wine is nice, but the Pastis meals disappoint. The frites are froid; the steak is kind of cool, too. I reheat the frites, first in the microwave, which makes them soggy, then in a pan, which does the trick. Twice-fried frites. Just about then, Barbara Austin calls me from the Dawn Animal Agency. ''Cats don't adapt just like that when they go into a strange environment,'' Ms. Austin says. ''It's not going to be sitting on your lap. They've got to get to know you.'' But what I want is so simple, I say. A loving fat cat to sleep with me as the winter winds howl. The sound of its soothing purr. Their animals are actors, right? Let 'em act. I just need the cat a few days. ''We do not leave animals with strangers,'' Ms. Austin says, coolly. ''There are a lot of weird people in the world. We don't want to provide a kitty for somebody's pit bull to practice on.'' Wednesday morning there is six inches of snow on the ground -- a wonderful morning for coffee, croissants, pan chocolat, and the papers. Cafe Lebowitz in SoHo delivers, even though I am out of the district. ''I told him you'd tip really well,'' the young clerk says. I do $10 for an $8.70 tab, even though he forgets the papers. Securing my books, however, is still a problem. Barnes & Noble's 1-800-The-Book has me on hold for 20 minutes, until I hang up on them. Carolyn Epstein, the owner of the Biography Bookshop, on the corner of Bleecker and 11th Streets, has the books, but not the staff -- it's out shoveling snow. She suggests Your Neighborhood Office, a few blocks away, at 332 Bleecker Street; their people run errands. Now we're talking! I have a Neighborhood Office guy to get my books, pick up the papers, then stop across the street at the Magnolia Bakery and get half a dozen cupcakes. I prefer pink and blue icing. I will have the perfect snowbound lunch, reading how dumb David Denby was and eating the icing off the cupcakes with my finger. Only the icing! Live large, toss the cake away. There's no time for relaxing, however, because I have to take another shot at elegant dining. I call restaurant Alain Ducasse and explain that it is my one-year anniversary and my husband is trapped in the house with a broken leg and I long to do something elegant only Ducasse could do. A cold, light supper perhaps? I could send a car. The woman I speak with seems sympathetic. The ma√Ætre d'h√¥tel will be in at 3:15, she says, and she will ask. Promising. Now, I'll shop. ''The key here is comfort,'' I tell the Bloomingdale's personal shopper. ''I want to get into bed and not come out until spring.'' ''Move over!'' she says. While some things I want -- the cashmere socks and silk pajamas -- are sold out, the shopper has other suggestions for comfort: a soft, cuddly robe; scented candles and bath oils (I think citrus would be nice); exotic chocolates. My massage, on the other hand, is a problem. I call half a dozen spas, including exhale, Completely Bare, La Prairie, Elizabeth Arden, the Spa at the Peninsula. It's getting to be as draining as reporting a tough news story, only in this case it's a mellow, soothing voice telling me, ''Please Hold,'' ''Let me transfer you,'' ''No.'' No one wants to send anyone to a private home; it's an insurance liability. Finally, someone suggests an independent contractor, Juan Johnson, who is working Midtown. I have by now become intrigued by something called hot stone therapy. Mr. Johnson, who says his friends call him J. J., says that would be kind of a hassle -- he'd have to go home to Mount Vernon to get the roaster for the stones. But he's game. He'll be at my house around 6. The call back from Ducasse comes soon after: Sorry, they're not equipped to do takeout. The Four Seasons? ''Not equipped.'' Six-thirty, the Bloomie's box arrives. The robe is a terrible shade of greenish-beige. The body oil's scent is grapefruit. The exotic chocolate is a box of Godivas, which, while I love them, are not the exotic mix I had in mind. The only thing that works for me is the Aromatherapy of Rome scented candle, with its ''rejuvenating mix of orange and ylang-ylang.'' The rest of this stuff will have to get back to Bloomingdale's. Correction. Somehow, I have to get it back. The lush life, by now, has me wrung out. I'm desperate for a Diet Pepsi, I've been so busy trying to have a luxe dinner experience that I forgot to order it, and now it's again too late in the day for delivery. A few minutes later, J. J., who I have started to think of as Hot Rocks, calls. There's the sound of traffic behind him and he's sounding very shook-up. He got into a blizzard-related car accident on the Deegan, he says. There was a little spin-out in front of him, everybody hit the brakes, he got rear-ended. Then he had to wait for the cops to come. If I really need him, he'll come, but he'd rather not. You sound as if you need the massage more than I do, I tell him. ''I'm going through a little trauma,'' Hot Rocks says. ''When things happen, you get the nervous excitement. It'll be better after I get some sleep. Not that I think I'll get much sleep tonight.'' I need a drink. Cristal! I call my pals at Crossroads and, after telling me how to chill it properly (small cubes and water for maximum coverage), they send the delivery guy over with their last bottle: $249.84 with tax. They've also had him pick up the ice. ''On the house,'' he says. Okay! The lush life, my first taste of Cristal, at last! It would probably be even lusher if I did not have to find my tarnished Salvation Army silver Champagne cooler and shine it, and the scent of silver polish was not overwhelming the rejuvenating mixture of orange and ylang-ylang. It would also be nice if I had been able to clean the house for the old friends I have invited over to try the Cristal. Or if I had a staff to get out the flea-market Limoges, the antique linen and Champagne glasses. After a full day's reporting, I am having a last-minute dinner party, which I never do. But for food, I'm finally getting smart: I've ordered in sushi from my very fine local joint, Japonica. They're happy to deliver. For desert, I revert to a luxe attempt. I call Vosges, a new chocolate place in SoHo. The woman who picks up the phone is enthusiastic. She suggests something called the Vincent Gallo collection. The only Vincent Gallo I know is the director whose independent film ''The Brown Bunny'' caused a scandal last year because of the scene in which Chlo√´ Sevigny, his one-time girlfriend, gives him oral sex. The director who did that ''Brown Bunny''? I ask. ''That bunny,'' the woman says. ''It's Vincent's persona of sorts, there's a segment that's a tall conical truffle, made with taleggio cheese with walnuts, vanilla and dark chocolate. Then there are two olive oil and white chocolates. Then there are two wild fennels. It comes with directions: You close your eyes and take three deep breaths before you taste it.'' How did Vincent Gallo come to have his own chocolate line? ''Vincent Gallo is a friend of the owner. I'm the owner.'' The owner's name is Katrina Markoff. Her messenger service is closed, but she delivers the chocolates ($60.83) herself, leaving her date waiting in the taxi. My friends and I eat chocolate, which we find a little weird, though possibly that is the essence of Vincent Gallo. Then we drink the Champagne. Then everybody tells me what I am doing wrong. I know exactly what's wrong: I need a personal assistant -- a middleman to make all those calls and run errands and spare me from the awkward moments in life. Returning all that stuff to the personal shopper at Bloomingdale's, for instance. Thursday morning, someone suggests Cross It Off Your List, a service that will, for $65 an hour, send over just such a person. Two hours later, a beautiful woman named Michelle (hyphenated assistant-actress) is at my door. I rattle off my needs: Return stuff to Bloomie's, take the linens to be laundered, procure cashmere socks and fabulous chocolates, order a cold supper for tonight. Get me two packs of Caffeine Free Diet Pepsi. Three and a half hours later, she's back. She's got a pound of Champagne truffles from Teuscher ($63), pink cashmere socks from N. Peal ($70.61), a sauvignon blanc blend ($12). She got the Diet Pepsi. She's got 2.5 ounces of beluga caviar from Caviarteria, which happened to be on sale; two little packages of mini-blinis; two ounces of smoked trout -- for a total of $268.95. Her firm has also arranged for a private chef to come over with the rest of the cold supper, which he will lay out. The chef, Andy King (hyphenated chef-event-planner-wannabe-television-host) arrives late afternoon, in Gucci pants, a Chesterfield coat and a St. Bart's tan. He is handsome enough to be an actor and soon may be. He is shopping a reality makeover show that he describes as Martha Stewart meets ''Queer Eye'' meets ''Trading Spaces.'' People call up; in 24 hours they redo the people, their homes, their dinner. For my dinner, he has done a grilled salmon with orange-citrus-tomato dressing, couscous and grilled vegetables. He's brought the garnishes for the caviar and a little tiramis√π cake. Time was short, so he got it from Dean & DeLuca. His fee, which will be added to the Cross It Off Your List tab: $174. Hot Rocks, meanwhile, has arrived. I put on Luther Vandross's ''Dance With My Father.'' He sets up the massage table. While the rocks are heating up, he does a salt scrub. I take a hot shower. Then he puts warm rocks in my palms and under my shoulders, rubs my back with a hot rock. He has big, powerful hands. The heat radiates into my muscles, the tension melts away, and so do the walls of my cramped bedroom. There is no winter. After two hours, I give him his $300 fee and a $60 tip, which pretty much cleans me out. Then I give him some Teuscher's truffles and say goodbye. ''Unless I marry a surgeon, I guess I'll never see you again,'' I tell him. ''But it's been great.''"
"It doesn't take much of a snowstorm in the middle weeks of March to remind inveterate weather watchers of the great March snowstorms of the past. Particularly -- for those of us in the Northeast -- the blizzard of 1888 and the superstorm of 1993. The 1888 blizzard, which killed some 400 people across the region, is now part of our meteorological ancestry, the kind of event that has continued to grow in stature even though the last witnesses are long gone. A blizzard will probably never be able to sneak up on us again the way that one did. We now have the luxury of seeing what's coming, watching open-mouthed as an event like the March 1993 storm develops. That one, as many of us remember, cut through 26 states and killed some 270 people. But the cruelty of a mid-March storm, even the modest kind that hit yesterday, is usually psychological. There have already been a few days of springlike warmth. Dawn shows behind the hills or beyond the skyline by 5:30, and twilight lingers till well past 6. Most of us have shifted out of our dire winter coats. The first flocks of robins are back on the ground, and in the country red-winged blackbirds can be heard in the marshes. Everything is tipping in one direction. And then it snows again. No one is responsible. But it feels like a kind of distributive injustice. There are parts of the world that really need this precipitation. Let them have it."
"Ordinarily when the forecast calls for snow, Marc Shein's four children, ages 6 to 12, put their pajamas on inside out before climbing into bed. It is something of a tradition among school children in Hillsborough, N.J., a practice that, according to legend, ensures a snow day. But this time, his kids didn't bother. ''I think even they're ready for it to stop snowing,'' said Mr. Shein, 45, a commercial real estate broker. And so it went yesterday, as a snowstorm crept in from the Great Plains and deposited up to several inches of snow in the New York region, blanketing hyacinth shoots and playsets, forcing the cancellation of flights and prompting early school dismissals, along with grumbles about the winter that wouldn't go away. With the official start of spring only four days away, the snow caught some off guard. Hecht Hardware in White Plains had stashed away its snow brushes and bags of salt last week, but pulled them back out of their warehouse for the day. James Baum, who corrals shopping carts in the parking lot of the Stop & Shop in Setauket on Long Island, showed up wearing only a black hooded sweatshirt. His coat, gloves and hat were at home. ''I thought we would have a few flurries and that would be it, but this is like real snow falling down here,'' he said. Historically, late-winter snowstorms are some of the most intense, like the blizzard in March of 1993 that buried Syracuse under 42 inches. Jeff Warner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University, said the lingering cold air in the atmosphere mixes with the warmth and moisture of the coming spring. ''That interaction can sometimes fire off some good winter storms,'' he said. In Central Park, 3.5 inches of snow had fallen by 1 a.m., although it was mixed with rain for much of the evening, according to the National Weather Service. Even before this storm, the snowfall for the season, 37.8 inches, had far surpassed the normal accumulation to date, 20.4 inches. Last winter, 49.3 inches fell in Central Park. For the most part, New York City and the surrounding areas did not bow to the storm. There were scores of flight cancellations and delays of up to an hour and a half at La Guardia and Newark Liberty International airports. But all three commuter railroads were running on time. While no records were set yesterday, one amateur weather historian, Stephen Fybish, tortured the statistics a bit to arrive at an approximation. Among the 52 snowiest winters at Central Park, with total snow falls of 30 inches or more, the 2003-04 season has had the longest late-winter period between days of measurable snow, one-tenth of an inch or more, 39 days from Feb. 6 to yesterday. Got that? In other words, New York City has just emerged from a remarkably long period in which there was no more than a trace of snow -- for a very snowy winter, that is. Through all of February, only seven-tenths of an inch fell in the city, and there were only dustings in March. That made some people a little nostalgic as they gazed out their windows, watching as the snowfall gradually painted the trees a dazzling white. ''It's one last hurrah for the snow,'' said Alicia Scolarino, 28, of Yonkers. ''It's nice to see the white one last time. It's peaceful.'' There were others who were just grateful that the snow did not arrive a day later, when it would have muffled the bagpipes on St. Patrick's Day. ''It's the luck of the Irish it didn't come tomorrow,'' said Richard J. Codey, a New Jersey state senator and a proud Irishman."
"As if teasing people on the eve of the new season, Mother Nature dumped a few inches of snow on the New York region overnight and early yesterday. But the sun peeked out by noon in most places, and thoughts of a thaw filled many gardeners' minds. ''People are edgy and anxious to get going,'' said Jack Morton, the owner of Richfield Farms and Garden Center in Clifton, N.J., which was mostly deserted yesterday. ''It's still a little early to plant much, but this snow doesn't make me happy and it does affect our business.'' The snow, such as there was, caused school closings in many districts throughout the region, though by noon some school officials might have been regretting their decisions. Tim Morrin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Brookhaven, N.Y., said that while 1 to 4 inches of snow fell in some outlying areas, there was no measurable snowfall in Central Park. ''It started out as rain, and then it did become snow,'' he said, ''but by the time it hit the ground much of it melted.'' With any luck, yesterday's snow might have been the last hurrah for winter. The forecast for this weekend calls for warmer temperatures in the high 40's, Mr. Morrin said. But now it's time to do the tallying. If you thought this was a snowier winter than usual, you were correct, Mr. Morrin said. For the entire season, Central Park measured 42 inches of snow, the second year in a row with more than 40 inches in winter, and about twice as much as the National Climatic Center considers normal for this area, Mr. Morrin said. But he said that April was expected to be normal, which in meteorological terms means not much colder or wetter than usual. Normal for April, according to the experts, means about 1 or 2 inches of snow for the entire month. But is it ever normal? Last year it wasn't. Last year, on April 7, Mr. Morrin said, four inches of snow fell in Central Park. ''It's not unprecedented,'' he said. ''But it doesn't happen very often.'' At the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the week's snow slowed down cleanup efforts that normally go on at this time of year to prepare for the lusher seasons. ''We work outside year-round, whether it snows or not,'' said Jackie Fazio, the garden's director of horticulture. She said crews were cleaning out storage areas as well as raking and cleaning up beds. When it thaws more, they will add lime to the lawns and plant before the big crowds of April and May descend on them. ''The snow just throws our schedule off a little bit,'' Ms. Fazio said. While she noted that the crowds are much smaller now than they will be, many more people are coming to visit the greenhouses, to see orchids and African bulbs forced into bloom to satisfy the cravings of city dwellers with cabin fever. ''People are itching to get out, to feel alive,'' she said. ''As soon as it starts to warm up, people are very eager to be outdoors. In the city environment, this is one of the few places they can come and be outdoors and enjoy the weather.'' At Waterford Gardens, a sprawling landscape center in Saddle River, N.J., customers have come in more frequently lately to buy pots of daffodils and tulips, said Katie Bartholome, a florist there. ''They all want spring to arrive, but this is the last big snow,'' she said. ''It's good for the plants.''"
"Schools will be closed throughout New York City today, officials said last night as snow blanketed the city in yet another winter storm. Four inches of snow had fallen in Central Park by midnight, the National Weather Service said. In all, the storm was expected to bring five to nine inches of snow to the city. It capped a spate of days of bitterly cold weather. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein announced the schools closing about 7 p.m. Regents examinations scheduled for today will be rescheduled, officials said. ''Given the potential severity of the storm, closing schools for Wednesday makes sense,'' Randi Weingarten, the president of the city teachers' union, said in a statement. New York City, with 1.1 million students and 1,200 schools, is the largest school system in the country. By 9:30 p.m., the thick snowfall had caused flight delays and cancellations at airports in the New York region. Flights at La Guardia Airport were delayed up to an hour, with 183 cancellations. At Newark Liberty International Airport, 269 flights had been canceled. In Manhattan last night, many people used umbrellas. Sidewalks were empty and cars glided slowly along the avenues. Drifting snow made curbs indistinguishable from the road. A Domino's delivery man walked his bicycle, a pizza in its basket, along Eighth Avenue. Further uptown, a visitor from Miami, Freddy Levy, dressed in a thin leather coat, shivered. ''I'm freezing,'' he said. ''I can't take it anymore.'' Others took pleasure in the quiet whiteness. ''This is just the right temperature,'' said Oren Shulman, who was sweeping snow from the sidewalk in front of his building on West 14th Street. ''It makes perfect snowballs.''"
"Snow and freezing rain fell across a wide swath of the Midwest and East Coast on Tuesday, causing power failures and delays in air traffic, as well as having a role in at least 50 deaths. In the Carolinas, hundreds of flights have been canceled at Charlotte Douglas International and Raleigh-Durham International Airports since Sunday. Nearly 250,000 residents of South Carolina, where freezing rain left a coat of ice up to an inch thick, lost electricity. Power was out for an additional 45,000 in North Carolina and Georgia. A spokeswoman for South Carolina Electric and Gas, Christy Farrell, said it would be days before the utility completely restored power. ''The problem has been getting it on and keeping it on,'' Ms. Farrell said. ''You get it up and running, and then there's another problem.'' A low-pressure system stretching from Georgia to Maryland and another bounding across the Midwest converged late Tuesday, threatening heavy snow for Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The Associated Press reported that weather was faulted for seven deaths in North Carolina; six in South Carolina; five each in Iowa and Missouri; four in Ohio; three each in Nebraska, Virginia, Minnesota and Maryland; two each in Illinois, Indiana, Pennsylvania and Oklahoma; and one each in Kansas, New Jersey and West Virginia. Most of the deaths were in traffic accidents. More than 27 inches of snow have fallen in Duluth, Minn., in the last two days, the third-largest snowfall since 1870, according to the National Weather Service. School has been closed since Monday, as plows worked to reach rural roadways. The school superintendent, Julio Almanza, said most of the 11,000 students in the district lived in the country, where many roads remained unplowed. Mr. Almanza, who went to work on Tuesday to carry out administrative duties, used a small plow to clear his 250-foot-long driveway before his 20-mile drive. ''I have my own little tractor,'' he said. ''And I have four-wheel drive, which is what you need up here.'' Akron, Ohio, pelted by freezing rain on Monday and snow on Tuesday, closed many schools as residents hunkered down. Peggy Oliver-DiMauro, who works at a one-screen movie theater there, said her company had doubled showings of ''Elf'' and ''Haunted Mansion,'' to increase revenue and accommodate families wondering how to spend their day off. ''One guy said, 'Thank God, you're open; I wouldn't know what to do,' '' Ms. Oliver-DiMauro said about a father with a handful of children at his side. Chicagoans, accustomed to January dustings, trudged through messy commuting trips as the snow continued to fall through the rush hour, slowing traffic to a crawl. More than 260 plows and salt spreaders started working early Tuesday morning. Although they quickly cleared most major roads, it took longer to clear the 3,300 miles of side streets, forcing residents to walk through calf-high snow drifts to clear off their cars. About 300 flights were canceled at O'Hare International Airport, and travelers faced two-hour delays for departures. Midway Airport, which dropped 16 flights, had 40-minute delays. A spokesman for the state police in Springfield, Ill., Vince Fischer, said his department had helped pull at least 85 people from ditches as a result of the storm. ''Part of the problem,'' Mr. Fischer said, ''is that people are continuing to drive the way they always have. They think, 'If I can go 65 in the summer, then I can go 65 in the winter.' But it doesn't work like that.''"
"AS we boarded our plane in Buenos Aires, we all agreed that the newspaper headlines had been quite alarming: the Patagonian ice fields, the papers said, melted twice as fast from 1995 to 2000 as they did from 1975 to 2000, as a result of global warming and lower snowfall at the bottom of the world. So what awaited us -- three well-traveled friends from three countries -- as we strode out of the airport into the bracing winds of El Calafate, the tiny Patagonian town of 6,500 that was to be our base for the next four days? Could we expect to see icebergs crumble before our very eyes? Would the glaciers' pristine ice-blue whiteness have faded? Would crevasses open below our feet as we trekked over the packed snow? We needn't have worried. As Luc√≠a Saquero, a mountain guide who led us later that afternoon on an ice trek across part of the 20-mile glacier Perito Moreno -- named for the Argentine explorer Francisco Moreno, an expert, or ''perito,'' in natural sciences --said matter-of-factly: ''There's no need for panic, if you come again next year, the glacier will still be here.'' The two ice fields in question, in Argentina at South America's southernmost tip, cover 6,600 square miles and include no fewer than 63 glaciers, some with spectacular walls of ice more than 300 feet high. Even at the present -- admittedly alarming -- melting rate of 10 cubic miles of ice a year, the glaciers look set to remain a major tourist attraction for years to come. But therein lies a problem. In a globalized world where getting away, really away, is becoming increasingly difficult, Patagonia has long been a byword for splendid isolation, the place to go for vast, empty spaces, geographical remoteness and rugged, untouched natural beauty. It still is. But since Argentina's economic collapse lopped two-thirds off the value of the peso, it is no secret that Argentina has become a bargain and Patagonia is nowhere nearly as expensive to visit as it once was. Our four-day package leaving from Buenos Aires included shared accommodation at the upscale country inn Kau Yat√∫n, two full-day excursions to separate glaciers, and hiking or horseback riding on a sheep ranch, and cost just over $550 a person, a third of what it would have cost two years ago. That means that the glaciers of El Calafate and of Ushuaia, the world's southernmost city, on the Beagle Channel navigated by Charles Darwin, and the whale-spotters' paradise Puerto Madryn, are attracting tourists by the thousands. Going exactly where you want, when you want and getting into the hotel you want can be a challenge. The tour operator had told us, for example, that trekking on the Perito Moreno glacier was a full-day excursion and could not be worked into our tight schedule. But all it took was a quick stroll to Sunny Tours, one of the dozens of local operators on El Calafate's main street, to join a half-day ice-hike with eight other tourists and two guides. It cost $75 each, and at the end of our four days we agreed it had been the highlight of the trip and well worth the money. The drive from El Calafate through the steppe and forests of Glaciers National Park to Shadow Bay, where we were to catch a ferry to the glacier, took just over an hour. Just before Shadow Bay, where the glacier wall rears into sight, a couple of tour buses parked and spewed out a group of about 30 Italian and Dutch tourists eager to make the most of the photo opportunity. Grumbling at this ''mass tourism,'' we independent travelers -- Gabi is a banker from Austria, Fran√ßa a photographer from Portugal and I am a journalist based in Brazil -- reflected that tour buses looked decidedly incongruous against such a pristine backdrop and that the authorities might be better advised to allow only more discreet minibuses inside the park. A few minutes later down at the jetty, we joined the Italians and Dutch on board the Perito Moreno ferry that was to take us across the Rico channel of Lago Argentino, Argentina's largest lake, for our hike. We might have been scathing about snap-happy tourists moments earlier, but once the boat began its 20-minute voyage along the 180-foot high glacier wall -- keeping a distance of about 900 feet, out of range of the ice shrapnel that flies in all directions when blocks of ice break off with a loud crack and tumble into the icy water -- we reached for our cameras like everybody else. The majestic wall of ice towered above the slate-green water. With the breeze chilling our ears we watched, enchanted, as the pale sun played peekaboo from behind the fast-moving clouds, sending ever-changing shapes racing like giant shadow boxers across the sheer glacier wall. Landing at a tiny wooden lodge, the guides' base, our group filed through a forest of indigenous beech trees for about 20 minutes, gasping occasionally as the white of the glacier appeared framed in clearings of lush green vegetation. At the bottom of the glacier, seated on wooden benches and huge boulders from the moraine that the ice pushes along as effortlessly as pebbles, we were kitted out with spikes -- metal snowshoes with jagged soles -- by our guides, Mariano Agriello and Luc√≠a. Both trained mountaineers, they gave the group concise instructions how to climb and descend the icy slope, basically by leaning toward the slope, bending the knees and/or ankles and keeping all the spikes impaled in the ice. Though this made everyone walk like the Incredible Hulk, it was not as difficult as we had imagined, and soon we were scaling the slopes, passing turquoise lagoons of deliciously fresh water, which we were encouraged to drink. Waiting every so often for Mariano and Luc√≠a to hack a pathway for us with their ice picks, we climbed 100 feet or so to the glacier's lowest peaks, from which we could peer over the apparently endless ice field. After two hours we climbed down again and stopped at a wooden bunker encased in the ice, from which Mariano produced a bottle of 12-year-old malt whisky, which he served after cramming our glasses with glacier ice. ''This is probably the first time you have drunk whisky on the rocks where the ice is older than the whisky,'' he said, and then enlightened us: it had taken the ice at this edge of the glacier 300 years to reach here from its source, 20 miles away. Although most glaciers in Patagonia have been in retreat for almost 100 years, Perito Moreno is stable. It replaces the amount of ice each year that is lost by icebergs' breaking off and floating down Lago Argentino. Formed by a high pressure zone over the Pacific Ocean to the west of Chile, reacting with lows over the Atlantic east of Argentina to produce snow that is compacted to ice on the Andes, Patagonia's glaciers crawl inexorably toward the sea or its myriad lakes. The next day we sailed down another arm of the lake toward the massive Upsala glacier, aboard Upsala Explorer, a comfortable coastal cruiser that wends its way through craggy icebergs to the glacier and deposits its passengers for an afternoon's hiking or horseback riding on Estancia Cristina, a sheep ranch founded in 1914 by a family of British immigrants, the Masterses. As I was one of only two passengers to opt for the horseback ride, it was here, in the deserted, windswept valleys dotted with heather, murmuring brooks and silvery lagoons, that I found the Patagonia I had imagined. We rode large but fairly docile horses for two hours before stopping for a picnic in the lee of a rocky slope overlooking the lake where the Masters family used to go fishing. Upon returning -- another two hours -- we joined the rest of the group who, after a brief hike, had been feasting at the old ranch house on roast Patagonian lamb and chocolate mousse. It was so good they saved no mousse for us. The food at our hotel, the Kau Yat√∫n, was also hearty, with a sprawling breakfast buffet served in the informal setting of a wood-paneled dining room-cum-bar. Though we all liked the Kau Yat√∫n's informal country style, we would have preferred staying at the Hoster√≠a Los Notros, the only hotel within the national park. A wooden lodge on a gentle slope opposite Perito Moreno, Los Notros has a main lodge and two separate wings of 32 rooms each with a stunning view over the glacier. Unfortunately there were no vacancies on the nights we were in Patagonia, and for the dates there were vacancies we could get no flights. After a look around, I would say the lodge is a must for recluses who like their luxury. There are no newspapers allowed, and no telephones or television in the rooms, though there are huge Jacuzzi tubs with views. A nod to modernity (and possible emergencies) is the solitary iMac that sits in the rustic, wood-beamed bar area. The nearest shop is in El Calafate, 25 miles away. ''Being discovered is a two-edged sword,'' said Lelia Cataldi, head of guest relations. ''We try to point our guests toward more exclusive activities, private glacier trekking, horseback riding far up the mountain, visiting the glacier at dawn or dusk before the buses arrive from Calafate or after they leave.'' In Calafate, nonetheless, we didn't suffer. At La Vaca Atada, a small, cozy restaurant on the small main street with the big name of Avenida Libertador General San Mart√≠n, we enjoyed a truly excellent dinner of cold cuts, followed by locally caught trout with rosemary potatoes, accompanied by champagne and a hearty Malbec red wine, for less than $15 a head. As at most other restaurants in town at peak hours, there was a 30-minute wait. Patagonia clearly is not as remote as it once was. Mixing and matching excursions After Argentina's economic crisis, Patagonia has become something of a bargain. For a trip of a week or 10 days, combining two or more destinations is probably a good idea. In El Calafate, one can visit spectacular glaciers, go trekking or horseback riding on a sheep ranch, or drive off road in four-wheel-drive vehicles to enjoy breathtaking views of Mount Fitzroy, over 11,000 feet of sheer granite and ice. For splendid isolation, one can stay a couple of nights at Los Notros, overlooking the Perito Moreno glacier. In Ushuaia, the world's southernmost town, there is an Alcatraz-like former jail, hiking, mountain biking and kayaking, and boat trips along the Beagle Channel, navigated by Darwin. Whales and penguins can be spotted near Puerto Madryn. Tour Operators and Agencies Though tours can be booked in advance, one can be more flexible using local operators on arrival in order to mix and match excursions on a day-to-day basis.

"Like most children his age, Karl Greenfield looks forward to recess, when he can go outdoors and play with his classmates. But after every snowstorm, instead of throwing snowballs or making angels, he sits indoors in an auditorium. ''You don't get to do anything,'' complained Karl, a bouncy second-grader at Public School 87, near 78th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. That is because P.S. 87 has no playground of its own. Instead, it uses a park maintained by the city's Parks Department. And unlike the Department of Education, which clears its playgrounds after every snowstorm, the Parks Department only shovels a path for pedestrians. On Thursday, after five inches of snow fell on the city, Karl spent yet another recess indoors, leaving him and his mother angry. ''It's a disgrace,'' said Ina Greenfield, a real estate broker, as she watched park employees sprinkle salt on the sidewalk at the end of the school day. ''He won't be focused tonight. He won't be able to sit down and read. Already, he's very unhappy with me.'' Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer, who represents the Upper West Side, said a similar situation had arisen at P.S. 191, on Amsterdam Avenue and 61st Street. In fact, 268 school playgrounds are run by the Parks Department and few are plowed, except when school custodians take it upon themselves to do so. ''The Parks Department does not generally clear playgrounds; we clear the perimeters,'' said William Castro, the Manhattan commissioner for the department. ''After the first day, if we are able to, we clear pathways in the major parks.'' He added, ''I'm not sure it's cost-effective to go in and clear playgrounds and spent a lot of money and resources when it's typically too cold for kids to play outdoors and when the snow typically melts in a day or two.'' Karl's mother would disagree. ''My son would be delighted to go outside and throw snowballs,'' she said. Because the 900 students are kept indoors, she added, ''the kids are sicker, they learn less, they are impatient and unhappy and frustrated.'' ''People hire dog walkers when they are indoors all day,'' she said. ''Children have the same muscular needs, or else they can't concentrate on learning.'' DENNY LEE NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK SNOW"
"After a snowstorm, there is a blessed window of time when all is soft and silent. Children run outside with sleds. Dogs run outside with owners. Frolicking ensues. But on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, the frolicking must be done quickly, before the salt truck arrives. There, as on pedestrian walkways in parks across the city, the Parks Department scatters coarse rock salt, which melts the snow but curtails sledding and irritates some dogs' paw pads. On Thursday morning at 9:30, for instance, the snow still glistened. But by 12:30, when Antoine Mill arrived pulling his 4-year-old son, Cash, on a yellowsled, the salt had burned a wet trail down the sloped walkway leading to the promenade. ''It's a bummer for the kids,'' Mr. Mill said. ''But then I'm sure there are people who are older who need it. And there are other places to sled.'' For dogs, there may be fewer options. ''In the worst-case scenario, the pads start bleeding'' when the salt is spread, said Penny Kaufman, whose dog, by cruel coincidence, is named Salty. Terrie Herrera, a local resident, said it was not always this way. ''When Raul was a puppy,'' she said of her Westie, ''I remember going down to the promenade and it would be just mounds of snow and ice and it would stay that way.'' Megan Sheekey, a Parks Department spokeswoman, said the promenade had always been salted, for safety, although in the past the city might have used a more expensive, milder chemical. ''Unfortunately, we don't have the resources now to use a milder salt,'' she said, adding that such treatment was reserved for areas with delicate stonework. The promenade, which recently underwent a $2.7 million renovation, is mostly concrete tiles and does not qualify. Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz said he would search for an affordable alternative to rock salt. Until then, for local residents, the only solution is to try to beat the rush. On Thursday morning, the promenade was still white when Ms. Herrera and her dog walked from one end to the other. But they weren't fast enough. ''Raul and I got halfway back and they had done half the promenade,'' she said. ''I had to pick him up and carry him the rest of the way.'' TARA BAHRAMPOUR NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK SNOW"
"First came the snow and bitter cold that closed down schools throughout most of the region and made a mess of the morning commute. Then came a bright sun that made the afternoon tolerable for those who didn't have to work outdoors. Then came the wind and hyper-chill that sent nighttime temperatures plunging toward record lows. It felt like three different days Thursday: cold, colder and coldest. Rich Sanita, a Federal Express driver who was picking up a package in Lido Beach in Nassau County's south shore, said the heater in his truck was no match for the temperature. ''I don't feel my toes and I have two pairs of socks on,'' Mr. Sanita said. He wore three layers of shirts, two pairs of socks and steel-tipped boots. The National Weather Service said the mercury dropped to 5 degrees in Central Park as of 8 p.m. yesterday, creating hazardous conditions for anyone outside for more than a few minutes. From 2 to 5 inches of snow fell throughout the region, but because it was so cold, the snow was as light as Styrofoam packing peanuts, making shoveling an easy chore for suburban homeowners. The weather service issued a wind chill warning, saying that it anticipated that the combination of wind and low temperatures overnight would bring the wind chill to minus 25, which could cause frostbite to exposed skin within minutes. Today, the high is expected to be 20 degrees, and while it will be partly cloudy, no snow is expected. Many suburban school districts closed yesterday, but the New York City school system was open. But the cold temperatures forced cancellation of many after-school programs, and kept many people in the city indoors. In Times Square, many visitors stayed away, giving it the feel of a Sunday morning. Many of the vendors whose piles of wares normally clog the streets were gone yesterday. Even ticket scalpers tried to stay indoors. At the Edison Hotel, several people were inside the vestibule on West 46th Street, selling tickets to ''The Producers,'' the hit Broadway play that was sold out weeks ago. At midafternoon, Central Park was shimmering and peaceful. Nadia Haussmann, 27, a visitor from Cologne, Germany, was strolling with her friend Joseph Gohnen, 41. The winter in Germany has been warm so far, Ms. Haussmann said, ""so we said that we had to go to New York to see some snow.'' ""There's a great atmosphere in Central Park,'' she said. ''Very romantic."" But the low temperatures brought a different set of problems for produce distributors in the region. On the loading dock of the regional produce market in Hartford, three men hoisted 50-pound bags of onions and mammoth crates of lettuce and tomatoes with glove-less hands and assembly-line efficiency. The thermometer read 11 degrees at 3 p.m. Joe Ruffini, an owner of Northeast Produce, was helping to load the trucks, keeping an eye on the time the produce stood on the cement floor. ''Nobody wants a mushy tomato,'' he said. It was too cold today, even for some animals. In southern New Jersey, employees at the Associated Humane Societies' Popcorn Park Zoo in Lacey Township, where stray, abandoned and injured animals are taken in, brought animals indoors earlier than usual. ''A lot of this is just normal for us, but we take extra precautions on a day like this,'' said John Bergmann, who oversees the zoo. The Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for Metro-North Railroad said the high winds and snow were causing some delays of up to 20 minutes for some commuters."
"Wearing a black wool cap and a 10 o'clock shadow, Claudio Edber had just finished scooping, blowing and scraping almost a foot of snow from his front steps, his driveway and car. He looked really tired. Not just of snow removal, but of winter, particularly this winter. ''It's too long,'' he said in a low growl. ''It started too early and I don't know when it's going to end. The cold is deadly.'' While Mr. Edber has become as much a suburbanite as his neighbors in Westchester, with a neat Dutch colonial and two young children, he is the first to admit that he left his body temperature behind in his native Argentina. Still, across the New York suburbs, where many places received 10 to 14 inches of snow, most everyone seemed on Wednesday to bemoan what is shaping up as one of the severest stretches of winter weather in memory. The unfortunate footnote, of course, is that it's not even February. While many city dwellers can saunter down sidewalks that someone else had to shovel and travel in subways removed from the endless chill, in the suburbs another big snowstorm meant another morning shoveling the driveway (or paying the guy with the plow), fishtailing on slushy side streets, and dreading the next fuel bill. At the Corner Nook Cafe in downtown White Plains, a little chalkboard seemed to say it all: 52 days till spring. According to Jeff Warner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University, the snowfall was evenly spread across the suburbs, with Bloomingdale, N.J., receiving 12.2 inches; Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., 10 inches; and Stamford, Conn., 11 inches. Dix Hills, on Long Island, recorded one of the biggest totals, 14.6 inches. There were hundreds of spinouts, fender-benders and other car accidents in the region, but none were fatal, law-enforcement officials said. For the most part, with the snow tapering off just in time for the morning rush, the trains kept running. New Jersey Transit came through the storm with no problems, but the Long Island Rail Road reported systemwide delays that averaged 14 minutes. In addition, service was suspended for almost two hours, starting at noon, between Jamaica and Flatbush Avenue because of smoke in the tunnel. Brian P. Dolan, an L.I.R.R. spokesman, did not know if the cause was related to the snow. The Metro-North Railroad, which decided to run on a Sunday schedule, reported a train breakdown in New Canaan, Conn., just after 7 a.m. Passengers on board were forced to wait an hour for the train to be pushed to Stamford. In all, 102 trains were late. On Long Island, businesses experienced a run on winter paraphernalia like ice scrapers, windshield washer fluid, electric heaters and rock salt. Indeed, locating a bag of rock salt had the aura of a modest lottery triumph. Christopher Griese, an architect in Sag Harbor, drove to five or six different places before finding a 10-pound bag at a gas station, which he proceeded to use up. Some tried to keep the weather in perspective. Leaning on a wooden cane next to half-buried parking meters and benches piled with snow, Edward Wethervee waited for a bus to take him to the Veterans Affairs hospital in West Haven, Conn. Mr. Wethervee, 83, a lifelong New Haven resident and a World War II veteran, said he was not impressed with the snow this winter. ''I remember when it used to snow before Thanksgiving,'' he said. He also said he remembered when cars did not have snow tires, and the streets went unplowed so horses could get traction. And, of course, with snow days stretching across the region, there were many happy awakenings. When Daniel Yaroshefsky, 13, of Hastings-on-Hudson, looked at his bedroom clock and saw that it was 8 a.m., he realized his mother had not awakened him for school and that it must have snowed. He went back to sleep until 10:38. Still, even for many children, the snow and chill had lost its luster. In Tarrytown, the Fassa sisters, ages 4, 7 and 10, ventured into their snowy backyard until 10-year-old Layla said her feet got ''all red and cold'' and 7-year-old Mina tripped on a rock and bumped her knee. Then they moved inside for a perfect winter-weary craft project: making rag dolls."
"One day after a storm left 10 inches of snow in the city, the Sanitation Department yesterday dispatched legions of workers to issue summonses to property owners who had not shoveled their sidewalks. The number of summonses issued yesterday was not available as of last night, but Keith W. Mellis, a department spokesman, said the department had aggressively enforced the law, with just about all of its supervisors, police officers and enforcement agents assigned to patrol city sidewalks to enforce the law. After the snowstorm that hit the city on Jan. 18, the city issued 6,908 summonses from Jan. 19 through Jan. 23 for failure to clear snow. Last winter, the city issued a total of 9,000. Earlier this week, Sanitation Commissioner John Doherty announced that department officials would be diligent in issuing summonses to people who failed to shovel their sidewalks even as Bloomberg administration officials have insisted that no ticket blitz is in effect in New York. By noon yesterday, most city property owners seemed compliant. Sidewalks in residential and commercial areas alike were shoveled. In fact, some city residents complained that the biggest offender in uncleared walkways was the city itself. For example, on several treacherous stretches of sidewalk along Roosevelt Avenue near 99th Street in Corona, Queens, pedestrians slipped along bumpy snow compacted into an icy thoroughfare. ''It's a mess around here,'' David Fernandez, a college student, said in describing conditions in his Corona neighborhood. ''Everyone has to do their part in clearing the sidewalks, but so does the city. Look at this sidewalk; people are falling all over.'' The councilman for that area, Eric N. Gioia, said yesterday that an elderly man had fallen on a walkway along Roosevelt Avenue that should have been shoveled by the city and had broken his pelvis and his collarbone. ''The city has its priorities backwards,'' he said. ''It should send out sanitation workers with shovels, not ticket books. You have an absolute obligation to clean your own house before pointing fingers at someone else. Instead, it is picking the pocket of people who can afford it the least.'' City law requires property and business owners to clear their sidewalks of ice and snow, from their building facade to the curb, within four hours after the snow stops falling. If the snow stops after 9 p.m., the owner has until 11 the following morning to comply. If the sidewalk is icy and particularly difficult to clear, a path for pedestrians must be cleared and some type of granular material -- whether salt, sand, sawdust or cat litter -- must be spread for traction. Snow may not be thrown into the street but must be piled up on the edge of the sidewalk near the curb. The first fine is $100 and repeat offenders can be fined up to $350. ''Our goal is not to start issuing notices of violation,'' Mr. Mellis said. ''Our first concern is the safety of residents on the street and the people who live in the buildings.'' Elena Diaz, 52, who owns the Roosevelt Laundromat, on Roosevelt Avenue and 112th Street in Corona, said that she kept her sidewalk clear of snow for the safety of her customers but also to avoid being fined. ''I keep on top of it,'' she said. ''But it's a shame when the city doesn't clean their part.'' She said she feared getting a ticket for a mound of ice that forms on the sidewalk in front of her coin laundry in the cold weather, from a leaking pipe suspended from the elevated train tracks above the avenue."
"The snowstorm that forced the closing of schools in New York City on Wednesday also forced students to miss Regents exams, some of which are required for graduation. Now the state must decide what to do next. Some public officials are calling for the test to be rescheduled, but education officials say that would not be easy and could cost roughly $3 million. ''It would be very difficult,'' said James A. Kadamus, a deputy commissioner of the State Department of Education. Because some schools elsewhere in the state gave Wednesday's tests -- chemistry, physics, global history and geography, United States history and government, and reading and writing tests for special education students -- the same tests could not be given again without the risk of cheating, he said. But developing and distributing new tests, he said, takes as long as a year and a half. ''We do not have one in the bank that we could pull out,'' Mr. Kadamus said. State Senator Carl Kruger, a Democrat from Brooklyn, said the state clearly should have had a backup exam. ''A 10-inch snowfall should not be treated as an aberration,'' he said. ''I think they should be embarrassed and ashamed of themselves if they say it takes a year to a year and a half.'' In New York State, Regents examinations are given three times a year: January, June (the busiest time) and August. January tests are often taken by special education students, students who have failed before and students completing semester-length courses. Some students may have needed Wednesday's exams to graduate this month. Oleg Ozersky, 17, a senior at Brooklyn Technical High School who is applying to colleges, said he had hoped a high score on the American history Regents would give his transcript a boost. Mr. Kadamus said the state would decide how to proceed next week. In the meantime, it is collecting information on how many students missed Wednesday's exams, and how many of them are seniors. Joel Littman, an associate principal at the Yeshiva of Flatbush Joel Braverman High School, said had he realized that a makeup exam was unlikely, he would have administered the Chemistry Regents exam to the five students scheduled to take it, regardless of the snow. ''They studied for the exam,'' he said. ''It's not fair.'' Joel I. Klein, the New York City schools chancellor, declined to take a position on whether the state should schedule a makeup exam."
"DURING his lecture tours in the early 20th century, Wilson Bentley was fond of saying that each of his ice-crystal photographs was unique. He had never found two identical snowflakes. Anyone who has caught a flake on a mitten or the tip of a tongue is probably familiar with the phrase he popularized: no two snowflakes are alike. He would know. Between 1885 and 1931, Bentley, a farmer who became known as the Snowflake Man, photographed 5,381 snow crystals, most of them caught on his family's farm in Jericho, Vt. Using a bellows camera rigged to a Bausch & Lomb microscope, he was the first to capture individual snowflakes on film. Today, at the back of the photogenic Old Red Mill in Jericho -- past the working loom and the village office where residents pay their taxes and water bills -- you can see his equipment and selected prints in the Snowflake Bentley Room. The mill, perched above Browns River, is about 12 miles northeast of Burlington on Route 15. In anticipation of the winter season, my wife, Laura Farrell, and I recently took a trip to the museum. (Its hours through March are Wednesday and Saturday, 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.; Sunday, 1 to 4:30. It is open daily April through December. Admission is free. More information is at 802-899-3225 or at www.snowflakebentley.com.) Next to the oversize camera, which is three feet long when fully extended, is Bentley's black collecting tray, used to sort specimens. Snowflakes can shatter in blizzards, and even with no wind at all many crystals break their arms in their descent from the clouds. A perfectly symmetrical flake is rare, ''one in a million,'' according to Kenneth Libbrecht, a physics professor at Caltech, whose www.snowcrystals.com Web site reveals his own obsession with snow. When Bentley captured a perfect specimen, he lifted it with a broom splint, then flattened it with a wing feather. With no electricity at his farm, he illuminated the crystals with the cloud-muted sunlight that came through the barn window, giving the images a silvery, highly polished shine. In a letter to Charlotte Bean, a woman who had requested some photographs, he hinted at his consuming passion: ''As usual, when good snowflakes are falling, I did not stop for dinner, or anything else, tho I had callers and became ravenously hungry.'' Bentley often referred to his fleeting crystals as gems: ''I wouldn't change places with Henry Ford or John D. Rockefeller for all their millions. I have my snowflakes!'' He was obsessed, which is not to say that he was limited. Bentley was a connoisseur of fog frost, window frost, frost heaves, ice flowers, raindrops, dew and the aurora borealis, which he recorded having seen 634 times from his farm over the course of 49 years. But it was the snowflake that brought Bentley fame. Each crystal begins its journey as a microscopic speck of dust in the middle or upper atmosphere. Water vapor crystallizes around this nucleus, typically clay, and temperature and humidity determine growth. (On ski slopes, freeze-dried Pseudomonas syringae, a commercially produced bacterium isolated from corn, is used as the nucleating agent for artificial snow.) The flake's journey is recorded in its arms. Stellar dendrites, the familiar snow crystals with six intricate branches like trees, are common in temperatures between 10 and 30 degrees. Below zero, hexagons are formed, and by minus 30, there's no innovation: the ''little artists of the snow,'' as Bentley called the forces in the clouds, restrict themselves to simple columns and pyramids. Given that there have been millions of years of snow and millions of flakes in each storm, can each flake truly be unique, as Bentley proposed? Dr. Libbrecht insists that it is true, at least for the large crystals: ''When you have a complex shape, it's like a fingerprint. The odds of all the features falling in the same place becomes astronomically small.'' For smaller crystals, Bentley gets off on a technicality. Although the typical water molecule is composed of two hydrogen molecules and an oxygen, one out of every 5,000 water molecules has deuterium (a heavier, stable isotope of hydrogen) instead of ordinary hydrogen, and one of every 500 water molecules will have a rare isotope of oxygen. The difference is not visible to the naked eye -- or even in Bentley's pictures -- but, like human DNA, it helps determine the individuality of a flake. ''Snow Crystals,'' a book featuring 2,453 of Bentley's photomicrographs, was published a month just before his death at 66 in December 1931, of pneumonia, possibly contracted during a long walk home through melting snow. Reissued by Dover, the book is like a well-organized snowstorm. In contrast, the exhibition is almost breezy, with a hundred or so contact prints, lantern slides, stereographs and montages. While we were visiting the mill, snow began to fall, and joyful screams descended from the sledding hill behind the museum. Later, stepping into the night, I watched stellar dendrites float out of the dark, each on its own trajectory to the same place -- a snowpack, measuring 18.8 inches by the storm's end. Even Bentley would have been impressed. It was the eighth-largest snowfall in the area since records began, and only one storm during Bentley's lifetime was known to have dropped more snow. My wife and I abandoned our plans to drive home. We were snowed in. DAY TRIPS"
"Last March, four friends and I decided to go snowshoeing one Sunday because it was supposed to be a bright sunny day. We drove to Barlow Pass in the Cascade Mountains in Washington State. Once we got on the trail, we didn't see any tracks. Nobody had been there since the last snowfall. The trail winds for about three miles through the woods with a 2,500-foot elevation. A pretty steady climb. I don't see myself as a risk-taker, though I like to do things outdoors that people might think are risky -- like scaling rocks or climbing Mount Rainier. But when you're rock climbing, you're protected by ropes and gear. I like saying I've done dangerous things. But to me snowshoeing is just hiking in winter. We were heading to Gothic Basin, but after three hours we reached a point where we had to cross an open slope. I don't know a lot about avalanches. I took only one class. It takes years to really know how to read the terrain, but there are certain basics. A dense bunch of trees can hold the snow in place -- not that they helped us that day. The three guys had already crossed the open slope by the time we got there, but Caroline and I decided not to risk it. We retraced our steps and sat down with some trees behind us and ate lunch. Caroline had Kyle's lunch, so we radioed him, and he walked back and joined us. We were looking across the whole valley. A beautiful panorama. Caroline and I had our backs up-slope, and Kyle was standing taking pictures. He looked up the mountain and said, ''Here comes some small stuff behind you.'' I jumped up and saw these little snowballs coming down. For about a second. Then the whole slope gave way, and I knew we were doomed. I thought, Maybe I can grab this tree, and then I was slammed and found myself going headfirst down the mountain screaming in my head, ''I don't want to die.'' I could see my hands and my sunglasses, bouncing in front of me, but that was it. The snow above me was light blue -- I wasn't buried that deep -- and then my leg slammed into a tree or a rock and I was spun like a rag doll. The rumbling was so loud. The snow grew heavier and started to encase me. I remembered that in an avalanche you're supposed to swim like you're in the ocean. So I pushed my body up and shot out of the snow. And the sky was so blue, the sun was right there, and I could feel the avalanche slowing down. So I thought: I'm out, I'm safe. But it picked up speed again. I could feel myself being shifted, and there was nothing I could do. Finally I managed to grab a tree and stop myself. The avalanche flowed around me for about five more seconds before stopping completely. I was facing up-slope. There were ski poles sticking out of the snow at weird angles, and I could see Caroline and Kyle. She was screaming, and he was moaning. Then he passed out. She ran to him on snowshoes. All of our snowshoes stayed on. Despite the fact that mine came off on the trail, they stayed on during the avalanche. My leg wasn't bloody, but when I tried standing, it gave way. If I moved slowly with no twisting, I could walk. I managed to reach Kyle and Caroline. He was coming around, holding his ribs, and he said, ''Your face is scratched.'' I took a clump of snow and put it against my face, and it came away bloody. When I saw it later, it looked as if I'd been clawed at by some animal. I was cursing and giving orders. I didn't feel as if I was in shock. I was probably just talking to keep shock away and stay focused on the present. Our backpacks and radios were buried, but Caroline wrote ''ALIVE'' in the snow for the others, and we hurried down. Half an hour later, they caught up to us. They made a splint for my knee by taking apart a hiking pole and helped carry me out. Besides tearing a ligament in my knee, I had also cracked a bone. When people found out about the accident, the first thing they would ask was ''Was it a big avalanche?'' That just shocked me, because it implied they had no idea of what we had been through. So I'd tell them, ''When you're in an avalanche, they're all big.'' But I guess it wasn't that big, because it didn't kill me. There wasn't enough snow, so it petered out in the end. For a couple of months, every time I'd think about the avalanche, I'd start crying. That's the way my body coped. The tears were always just below the surface. It was partly the trauma and partly how it left me. Injured. The wilderness has always been my safe place -- the place I'd go to step out of society and process things -- but now the wilderness did this to me. Sometimes there's a part of me that says: ''Wow, you're pretty tough. You survived an avalanche.'' Then immediately another part of me says, ''Don't you ever brag about this.'' Bragging implies that you actually did something; you set a goal and accomplished it. But surviving had nothing to do with me. It's not as if I could say: ''Watch me. I'll do it again.'' LIVES"
"LOOKING back on her nearly three decades at Century Village, a retirement community in Deerfield Beach, Fla., Julia Rivman sighed wistfully. ''Oh, when I think how I used to walk and run,'' she said. ''We had aerobics classes every day. We used to go for swims. We would walk to the clubhouse and play duplicate bridge every Monday for a good 25 years.'' But the death of her husband, Nathan, in January, and chronic back pain that left her largely confined to her La-Z-Boy soon put the brakes on all that. Urged by her adult daughters, both New Yorkers, Mrs. Rivman, who is 87, decided to pull up stakes. Last July she weeded her possessions, said goodbye to her friends and headed north, moving a gallery of family photographs and a collection of orange-upholstered furniture into a tidy one-room apartment at the Classic Residence, a for-profit complex for the elderly in Yonkers. The Hudson River flows past her window, and her family can visit easily. Mrs. Rivman is part of a rising tide of retirees who 25 or 30 years ago left behind snow drifts, harsh winds -- and family ties -- for the lure of sunny retirement communities then springing up in Florida, Arizona and Southern California. Most envisioned their new lives as an endless round of tennis, bridge and golf. And few anticipated living past their 70's, to an age when declining health and loneliness would compel them to pull up roots again. Today extended life spans -- and the pull of families back home -- are prompting ever greater numbers of Sun Belt retirees to perform an about-face, selling their retirement houses and returning to the North. ''Such people have led active lives in their retirement communities for years or even decades,'' said Andrew Kochera, a senior policy advisor for AARP, the advocacy group for the elderly. ''Then a decade or two passes, and they find their needs are changing. One spouse might have a disability or perhaps one has died.'' ''They find they don't have the informal support they feel they need to remain independent,'' Mr. Kochera added. ''Then the option of moving back to a place where they have long-established ties and perhaps family becomes very appealing.'' Today Mrs. Rivman gets around with a walker, and her concept of living well is a good deal more austere. ''All I need are three prepared meals, a view of the water and a game of bridge,'' she said. Her daughter Marion Rivman, a freelance public relations consultant in New York, who shared Thanksgiving with her mother in the dining room of the Yonkers retirement home, is also happy with the arrangement. ''I've stopped having nightmare visions of my mother lying helpless on the floor,'' she said. ''I don't have to worry, is she taking her medication? That's monitored here.'' Reverse migration, a term that has been used for more than a decade to describe the exodus by the elderly from the Sun Belt, is cited by demographers as a trend still gathering force, primarily among retirees from their late 70's to their 90's. ''We aren't sure about the rate of migration, but we know the volume of people moving north has increased in the past few years,'' said Richard Suzman, the head of social and behavior research at the National Institute of Aging in Washington. The primary reason, he noted, is ''simply that there are more older people.'' Americans over 85 make up the fastest growing segment of the population by percentage. NEW housing options have also fueled the trend. ''Fifteen years ago when I got into the business, if you went to Florida or Arizona, the expectation was you would die there,'' said David Goldsmith, the executive director of the Classic Residence, where Mrs. Rivman lives. ''If you did move back North, the scenario was your children took you back into their house or put you into a nursing home. Fifteen or 20 years ago there weren't as many assisted-living facilities in this part of the country.'' Classic Residence is part of a chain of 19 luxury housing complexes for retirees owned by an offshoot of the Hyatt Hotels company. Some of its locations outside the Sun Belt are in Chevy Chase, Md.; Teaneck, N.J.; and Glenview, Ill. So-called assisted-living communities, which offer services such as nursing and medical care for residents with Alzheimer's disease, charge from about $3,500 to $7,500 a month, depending on the level of service. Along with traditional nursing homes, small independent boarding houses and age-restricted apartments for the elderly -- some renting for no more than about $550 a month -- there are some two million residences in the United States catering primarily to people over 75, according to the National Investment Center in Annapolis, Md., a research group for the elderly housing and care industries. While most housing for the elderly still tends to be in the Sun Belt, more is springing up in metropolitan areas of the Midwest and Northeast. ''We've seen an explosion in the last 20 years in the number of age-restricted properties of all types in those areas,'' said Tony Mullen, the director of research for the National Investment Center. Martha Lawner, 88, another tenant of the Classic Residence in Yonkers, had long lived with her husband, Murray, in a condominium at a retirement complex near Miami. They played bridge and attended frequent cocktail parties with a wide circle of friends, a life they imagined would continue indefinitely. Mrs. Lawner said she first considered moving north when her husband developed heart problems. But it was her own fall that ultimately triggered their relocation. ''I wasn't really sure why she fell,'' said Sharon Weinberg, Mrs. Lawner's daughter, who had accompanied her mother to have cataract surgery in the nearby Riverdale section of the Bronx on the day they were interviewed. With a worried glance she turned to Mrs. Lawner, reminding her, ''Afterwards you lost some confidence in your ability to do everything you needed to do.'' AFTER some soul searching, Ms. Weinberg, a vice-provost of faculty affairs at New York University, began a campaign. ''My parents were no longer on the golf course or on the beach, so when you think about what they were giving up, the decision to move here was a no-brainer. But part of the challenge was convincing them it was a no-brainer.'' Mrs. Lawner resisted at first. ''I'd call Sharon from Florida all the time and tell her: 'This is so hard. Daddy doesn't feel well,''' she said. ''Then I would fall down and land in the hospital. Sharon kept suggesting that we move, and I'd say no. I guess I was afraid of losing my independence.'' Today she says she does not regret the move. A bonus is her proximity to good medical care. ''We've found a good set of doctors nearby who we have confidence in,'' her daughter Ms. Weinberg said. Assisted-living facilities market themselves aggressively both to the elderly and to their adult children, promoting properties that have sprung up within the past half-dozen years in and around cities like St. Louis, Chicago, Kansas City, Washington, New York and Boston. ''About 30 percent of new residents in our facilities come from the metropolitan areas,'' said Mark Schulte, chief executive of Brookdale Living Communities, a Chicago-based operator of retirement residences around the country. ''One reason they cite is they want to be closer to their families.'' Many who have made such a move are resigned to the fact that it will probably be their last. ''Some of us are living longer, and we plan to stay put,'' said Mildred Levy, 91, who lives at the Hallmark, a residence for the elderly at Battery Park City in Manhattan run by Mr. Schulte's company. Gesturing toward the management office a few yards from where she sat in the lobby, she added with a chuckle, ''I think it surprised them. They expected a faster turnover.'' When Mrs. Levy's husband died last year, she sold their condominium in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., to move closer to her twin sons, who live in Manhattan. ''I had loads of friends, but still I felt alone in my apartment'' in Florida, she said. ''Since I'm 91, I decided the best thing was to be near family. For me it's been a good move.'' Mrs. Levy, a former medical stenographer and middle-school teacher in Brooklyn, maintains a robust schedule. A lively, take-charge woman, she organizes outings to the ballet and the theater, and card games for a handful of the 200 residents at the Hallmark, although not as often as she might like. ''In Florida we had more culture,'' she said. ''There were shows all the time at our theater, square dances and plenty to do.'' ''You don't have to go out if you don't want to,'' she added. ''There is a little button to push early in the morning to let them know that you're alive,'' she said wryly. ''Otherwise they look for you. You know you're not alone.'' Concerns about isolation and increasing frailty often fuel the decision to move. In most cases, experts say, the conversation is initiated by a younger family member after a parent's illness or an accident. ''Usually there is a fall or a hospitalization,'' said Mary Buchanan, a geriatric social worker in Miami. ''Once the daughter comes down, she might check on the apartment and see Mom isn't really as capable as she says she is. Maybe there isn't enough food in the refrigerator, or the apartment isn't all that clean. Or maybe she is a little forgetful and might do better in a secure or supervised environment.'' That, Ms. Buchanan said, sparks a discussion about moving the parents back north. EUNICE WARD, a divorce lawyer in Chicago, moved her father, Joe, 93, from Florida to the Breakers, a retirement community on that city's North Shore. ''He was a guy who liked to drive around and be out and about in the Florida weather, but his eyes were bad -- he realized that he could not do all those things anymore,'' Ms. Ward said. ''When he came up to see us four years ago, we all agreed he couldn't go back.'' She does not regret the decision. She and her sister visit their father each week, and he sees more of his grandsons than when he lived in Florida. Ms. Ward described his new home as something akin to a college dormitory. ''Somehow as old as these people are, they still develop community, they still develop friends,'' she said, adding delightedly: ''My father has a lady friend. She lives on his floor.'' In Yonkers, Mrs. Rivman, the 87-year-old Florida transplant, is also reconciling herself to her new life. ''Sure I miss my friends; I miss being outdoors,'' she said. ''But I wasn't going out, so it didn't matter much if I was in New York or in Florida.'' She was swift to point out that there are compensations. She plays duplicate bridge several days a week, reads voraciously and enjoys taking meals in the dining room. Then there is the view. ''I love my yellow trees,'' she said, gazing out her picture window, which framed a sliver of the Hudson River and a dense grove of maples. ''At my age, those things can be enough.''"
"Much of the Midwest spent Friday digging out from a winter storm that left motorists stranded, airports snarled, power lines down and Christmas deliveries delayed. Snow continued to fall in some of the affected area, which stretched from Texas across Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky to Ohio. Police officers, Red Cross workers and National Guard troops came to the rescue of hundreds of drivers and thousands of housebound families. More than 300,000 people were without power in Ohio and Kentucky alone. The National Weather Service warned of bitter cold reaching hazardous levels on Saturday in large parts of Illinois and Indiana. Kevin Smith, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's office in Paducah, Ky., said the worst-hit area was southwest Indiana. Mr. Smith, who has been a meteorologist for 17 years, said the storm was ''definitely one you could put in the record books.'' In Harrison, Ohio, where nearly two feet of snow fell, Chris Petty, a police officer, said several neighbors had to help when his pickup truck became stuck in his driveway. He had been called to a serious accident on Interstate 74, parts of which were closed. ''It's still incredibly dangerous out there, especially near Batesville,'' Mr. Petty said. He said Batesville, which is east of Columbus, received up to 32 inches of snow. One of those who crawled along the single open lane of I-74 on Friday was Jack Nienaber of Fort Thomas, Ky. He said his daughter, Cameron, had called him for help after becoming stranded at the airport in Indianapolis. She was one of many passengers whose travel plans were disrupted as airlines cancelled or rerouted hundreds of flights. ''We'll just have to take it easy and probably spend the day on the road,'' Mr. Nienaber said. In Evansville, Ind., Steve Wood said the Holiday Inn, where he works at the front desk, and the other hotels were full to overflowing. ''There have been at least 50 to 100 people packed into the lobby,'' Mr. Wood said. ''I've lived here for 20 years, and I've never seen the snow like this, ever.'' Sgt. Mark Parsons of the Indiana National Guard said the storm stranded about 600 vehicles on a 20-mile stretch of Interstate 64 near Evansville. ''We've had snow duty and different kinds of emergencies, but not quite to this level, dealing with this many people,'' Sergeant Parsons said. ''We got really lucky that no one was hurt substantially and there was no loss of life.'' Todd Ringle, a spokesman for the Indiana State Police, said rescue workers had been ''running ragged.'' Some troopers worked 24-hour shifts, Mr. Ringle said, and all stranded passengers along I-64 had been rescued by midday Friday. Many towns in Brown County, Ohio, which is east of Cincinnati, escaped the snow but were hit by rain that quickly froze. On Friday, only a few cars were on the ice-slicked streets, maneuvering to avoid downed trees and branches. In Georgetown, Ohio, power was out and people huddled around kerosene heaters. Emergency crews walked door to door, picking up elderly people and taking them to temporary shelters. ''We keep being told that the electricity is coming back on, but we're still waiting,'' said Todd Manning, a dispatcher at the Brown County Communications Center. ''Everywhere you look, you see downed wires and tree limbs,'' Mr. Manning said. ''Every emergency worker has been working since Wednesday.'' A statement posted Friday on the Web site of American Electric Power, a utility that serves parts of Ohio, said at least 36,000 people were still without power Friday in the Canton, Wooster, New Philadelphia and Coshocton areas. Overnight shipping companies warned that delivery of some Christmas packages might be delayed. A statement on the DHL Web site said that weather had slowed operations at its centers in Cincinnati and Wilmington, Ohio, and that many deliveries would be delayed 24 to 48 hours. The airport at Louisville, Ky., which is the global hub for U.P.S., was open, but U.P.S. said some deliveries would be delayed. The company said it was ''utilizing all available equipment and personnel.'' Regular mail was also delayed in some places. There was no delivery Thursday or Friday in some areas near Cincinnati. Christmas cards and packages will remain in some post offices through the holiday, said Bonni Manies, a spokeswoman for the United States Postal Service in Cincinnati. ''For people who waited until the last minute to send mail,'' Ms. Manies said, ''I'm not sure we can get those packages delivered.'' Mayor Charlie Luken of Cincinnati extended the city's snow emergency on Friday, and urged residents to remain close to home. ''The wet streets you see now will be frozen overnight and tomorrow,'' Mr. Luken said. In Arkansas, Jason Massey, a lawyer who works in Little Rock, said his family had postponed its Christmas gathering. ''There's been a lot of stupid drivers out there,'' he said. ''We're not used to this weather.'' Not every creature found the storm troublesome. ''The polar bears love it,'' said Jack Ringstmeier, the facilities and building manager at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo. ''They're tickled to death.'' Janice McManigal of Veedersburg, Ind., was among those who set out for her Christmas holiday in Tennessee without anticipating the strength of the storm. When the snow became too intense, she pulled into a motel. Her family spent Wednesday and Thursday nights there, meeting others who had spent up to 20 hours trapped in their cars. She said everyone she met had been patient and understanding. ''The weather cannot stop the spirit of Christmas,'' Ms. McManigal said. ''It will prevail wherever you are.''"
"TO please traditionalists who insist on the snowshoes of yore, Tubbs Snowshoes still makes a few clunky wooden models. But the purists are outnumbered 99 to 1 by customers who prefer more modern footwear, which resembles miniature skis rather than tennis rackets. ''You've still got hunters and trappers who prefer wooden snowshoes, because they're so quiet,'' said Dan Kiniry, Tubbs's product manager. Snowshoers whose typical winter outings don't include sneaking up on prey, however, gravitate toward sleeker models made of aluminum and stainless steel. Tubbs hopes that the most adventurous enthusiasts will pay up to $289 for its latest snowshoe line, the Elevation series. The six types of Elevation shoes, which vary in price according to how much weight they can bear, were designed for snowshoers who like to trek in remote areas. The important feature is a new ski-like binding, called the Nexus, that can be fixed easily on the trail. ''There are some bindings that, if they fail, it basically renders the snowshoe unusable,'' Mr. Kiniry said. That can become a huge problem if you are miles from the nearest road and facing a blizzard. The Nexus, however, is equipped with the snowshoe equivalent of a manual override: the binding can be lashed to the foot as if it were an old-fashioned rawhide strap, allowing the hiker to clomp back to civilization. The soles of the Elevation series shoes are lined with steel crampon teeth, each more than an inch long. That's longer than most snowshoers need, but crucial for back-country hikers who ramble over both icy mountainsides and powdery dales. When designing the Elevations, said Mr. Kiniry, the biggest challenge was balancing weight and strength. Snowshoeing is a grueling physical activity -- it can burn more than 1,000 calories an hour -- and heavy footwear makes it all the more exhausting. Starting in 2002, the Tubbs design team came up with 12 two-dimensional designs; a focus group of snowshoers then reviewed them. That helped narrow the list of candidates to three, which were turned into prototypes. The shoes that were introduced in July combine the best attributes of all three finalists, from weight (the lightest women's model is 3.56 pounds a shoe) to sole construction (using a puncture-resistant alloy that won't crack at temperatures of 40 below). Tubbs has been making snowshoes since 1906 -- 16 years before many Americans first glimpsed the contraptions in the Arctic documentary ''Nanook of the North.'' Late last year, the company, based in Stowe, Vt., was acquired by the sporting-goods giant K2 of Carlsbad, Calif., and Tubbs now plans to move its manufacturing from Vermont to China. In recent years, Tubbs has emphasized snowshoeing's health benefits, sponsoring professional races and snowshoe festivals. One of the fastest-growing segments of the market has been older adults who want to keep fit during the winter but no longer wish to brave downhill skiing. Tubbs has tried to spread the word that modern snowshoes don't force their users to waddle like ducks: novices wearing the old-fashioned ''tennis rackets'' often have to walk with unnaturally splayed feet or bowed legs in order to remain upright. Still, Mr. Kiniry acknowledged that some longtime snowshoers would never make the switch from wood to aluminum, no matter how many fancy bindings and crampon systems Tubbs invents. Aside from hunters and trappers, people who gather maple syrup in spring prefer the older models, swearing by their performance in the deep, wet snow of early March. And if a leather lace comes undone on a traditional snowshoe, it has never been a problem to put it back on. Nanook and his peers were apparently mindful of the worst-case back-country situations. OPENERS: THE GOODS"
"Snow, ice and high winds extended from the Great Lakes to the Texas Panhandle on Thursday, tying up traffic, delaying flights and disrupting holiday travel plans for thousands of people. At least 13 people were killed in weather-related traffic accidents in Illinois, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas. As much as two feet of snow fell, and drivers like Joe Bartlett of Alexandria, Ky., was clutching his steering wheel. It took Mr. Bartlett five hours on Wednesday night to drive home from Lexington, usually an hourlong trip. ''I saw a car off the road about every 200 feet,'' he said. ''So it was white knuckles for me.'' More than 300,000 homes in Kentucky and Ohio were without power. Records for snowfall were broken in cities like Paducah, Ky., with 14 inches, and Dayton, Ohio, with 16 inches. As many motorists took off for the long weekend, icy roads and poor visibility caused traffic accidents and congestion. Hundreds were stranded on major roadways, and parts of Interstates were closed in several states. An inch of snow and poor visibility contributed to a 22-car pileup near Cheyenne, Wyo., on Wednesday that sent nine people to the hospital. Amarillo, Tex., with almost eight inches of snow in two days, reported at least 100 weather-related crashes. In Indiana, 40 counties declared local emergencies. Gov. Joseph E. Kernan declared disaster emergencies in some regions and closed state offices in 44 counties. He urged travelers to stay off the roads. Along Interstate 64, which was closed eastbound from the Illinois line to Evansville, Ind., the state sent helicopters, and National Guard troops searched for stranded motorists. The Red Cross provided emergency assistance and set up shelters. Travelers were taken to National Guard armories in Evansville and Salem, Ind., and to shelters in at least three cities. More than a foot of snow covered the Interstate when tractor-trailers overturned on Wednesday night. When temperatures fell into the teens, travelers worried about warmth and food. They abandoned their vehicles as they were rescued, leaving behind presents and luggage. Mr. Kernan later closed sections of Interstates 64, 65 and 74. Greyhound closed three bus stations and canceled service on 12 routes between Tennessee and Ohio. Stranded riders bedded down in the coaches, whose engines were left running to provide heat. The company said that it gave riders vouchers for food and that Red Cross delivered food and other supplies for mothers and babies. Airplane passengers were also affected. Flights involving Atlanta, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia and Washington were among the many that suffered delays of up to two hours. More than 200 flights were canceled on Wednesday at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. A spokesman for the airport, David Magana, said conditions improved on Thursday. ''We're hopeful,'' Mr. Magana said, ''everything will work out and everyone will get to grandma's house.''"
