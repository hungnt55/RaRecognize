"Why Time Stands Still Time marches on -- except when you turn your gaze toward a clock with a second hand. Then, in what is a common illusion, the hand can appear to have stopped, momentarily, before it moves again. Researchers in Britain have now shown why this illusion occurs, and say it is related to what happens when the eyes move from one fixed point to another, known as a saccade. Vision is blurred during the hundred milliseconds or so of a saccade, so the brain is unable to determine with certainty whether any objects in the field of view have changed positions. So the brain extends the perception of the target -- the clock, with its second hand in a specific position -- back in time to the beginning of the eye movement. This can make it seem as if the second hand were in that position for longer than it actually is. The researchers performed experiments using human subjects who focused on one point on a computer screen, moved their eyes to focus on a numeric counter that changed every second (the digital equivalent of a second hand) and then estimated how long the first digit was on the screen compared with the succeeding ones. The subjects consistently overestimated the duration of the first digit. When the experiment was altered so the counter changed position while the eyes were moving, no time illusion was experienced. This, the researchers wrote in the journal Nature, shows that the phenomenon is linked to the brain's assuming that the target is fixed during the eye movement. There's no word on whether the researchers are now turning their attention to the question of why a watched pot never boils. Cold-blooded Behavior It's a fact of life in the animal world: males sometimes imitate females. The behavior is usually seen as a mating strategy -- a male that mimics a female's appearance, say, may avoid aggression by larger males and eventually get the partner of its dreams. But a study of male garter snakes suggests another reason for female mimicry, and love's got nothing to do with it. It's all about staying warm. Biologists at the University of Sydney in Australia and the University of Oregon studied red-sided garter snakes in Manitoba. These snakes mate in large groups in their dens, with as many as 100 males writhing around one or just a few females in what is known as a mating ball. In the first day or two after emerging from hibernation, when they are cold and slow, male snakes produce femalelike pheromones. This attracts already warm males who form a mating ball around the just-emerged snake. The ball, the researchers suggest in Nature, protects the weak snake from potential predators like crows. But more important, all that pressing the flesh warms the snake up quickly. By attaching tiny thermal sensors to the snakes, the researchers found that a garter could go from about 40 degrees Fahrenheit to about 70 degrees in half an hour. And when you're coldblooded, every bit of heat helps. A Volcano's Added Layer As volcanoes go, Mount Vesuvius is relatively small. But it packs quite a punch, as the unfortunate residents of Pompeii and Herculaneum learned in A.D. 79. Now, Italian and French researchers have found that Vesuvius represents the tip of what might be described as a volcanic iceberg. Underlying the volcano is a massive layer of molten rock. This magma layer extends at least 150 square miles and is located about five miles underground. The researchers, who described the finding in the journal Science, discovered the layer by analyzing seismic waves generated by small explosions created by air guns on a ship in the Bay of Naples. The researchers say that knowledge of the layer won't help predict when Vesuvius will erupt again (it last did so in 1944), but it does point to areas that can be monitored for signs of an approaching eruption.

"Though the Senate voted two years ago to reject a treaty that bans nuclear testing, one of its provisions is alive and thriving: the global network of sensors meant to listen for clandestine nuclear blasts. Though still under construction, the International Monitoring System is already yielding a wealth of science spinoffs, detecting violent winds, volcanic eruptions and the crash of meteoroids from outer space. ''It's a vast new tool,'' said Hank Bass, director of the National Center for Physical Acoustics, based at the University of Mississippi. ''For the first time, we'll have a global system of microphones listening to the atmosphere of the planet.'' The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty calls for 90 countries to be host to a network of 321 stations whose sensors monitor the land, sea and air for faint vibrations and other telltale signs of nuclear blasts. More than 100 stations are now relaying data by satellite and cable to Vienna, where 220 people work at the system's headquarters. Despite the Senate rebuff in 1999, the United States is a major backer of the monitoring system. It pays about a quarter of the total costs, and United States technical and scientific support is regarded as crucial to the network's success. Earlier this year, some treaty opponents tried to halt the financial aid, saying the ban's goals were illusory or contrary to American interests. But its backers fought back vigorously, led in part by Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont, whose defection from the Republican Party put Democrats in control of the Senate earlier this month. Battles over the monitoring system continue in Washington, and it is unclear if American support will continue. Experts on both sides say the existence of an effective monitoring system, which its proponents see as central to treaty policing, would increase the chances that the accord might one day be revived. In all, the surveillance system is to have 170 stations that detect underground shock waves, 11 that track undersea explosions, 80 that sniff the air for telltale radioactivity and 60 that listen for revealing sounds in the atmosphere, including winds and shock waves. Dr. Gerardo Suarez, a geophysicist from Mexico who directs the International Monitoring System in Vienna, said the emerging network was starting to excite experts far beyond the world of arms control. ''The scientific community is awakening to the enormous possibilities,'' he said in an interview. Interested groups, he said, include the World Meteorological Organization, which wants wind data for global weather forecasting, and the World Health Organization, which wants to track radioactivity in the atmosphere. ''It's a tremendous challenge,'' Dr. Suarez said of building the global network. ''There's never been anything like it. We have stations from the Arctic to Antarctica.'' New additions to the surveillance system include ground-based microphones that listen to the air for low-frequency sounds far below the range of human hearing. Dr. Douglas Christy, head of the acoustic group in Vienna, said that by the end of the year some 20 of the 60 sound stations will be operational. ''Things are moving along very rapidly,'' he said. ''It's hectic. But we're happy with it.'' On April 23, the fledgling system detected a speeding meteoroid that crashed into the atmosphere over the Pacific, where it produced a blast nearly as powerful as the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. In the past, such explosions often escaped notice because they usually occur over the sea or uninhabited lands. The new information will help scientists calculate how often these strikes occur and the odds of ''doomsday rocks'' hitting the planet. Today, the International Monitoring System and its member states are keeping the data private among themselves until global agreements can be made for its wider release, Dr. Suarez said. A few nations, he said, fear that improper analysis of the data might confuse small explosions in the mining or construction industries with clandestine nuclear blasts. Preliminary work on the monitoring system began in late 1996 after the treaty was opened for signature and has been accelerating ever since. In the United States, the Defense Department does much of the work. Treaty opponents have argued that small blasts can elude the monitoring system and that America might one day need to test its old nuclear arms or design new ones. When the Senate in 1999 rejected the treaty, conservative Republicans tried, but failed, to cut the monitoring funds as well. Early this year, just after President Bush took office, they launched a new drive. On March 12, Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who then was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, wrote the State Department to urge that the United States remove its signature from the test-ban treaty and ''terminate funding'' for its organizations, including the network of sensors. On April 4, 10 Senate Republicans, including Mr. Helms and Trent Lott of Mississippi, then majority leader, made the same argument to Donald H. Rumsfeld, the defense secretary. ''We urge you,'' they wrote, ''to terminate Defense Department efforts to implement the treaty.'' Treaty opponents call support for the system -- or any provision or organization called for in the treaty -- a surrogate for backing the treaty itself, which is why they want the monitoring effort halted. Frank J. Gaffney Jr., a former Pentagon official who opposes the pact, said in an interview that the monitoring is ''a backdoor way to get us'' into the treaty. Mr. Gaffney, who directs the Center for Security Policy, a private group in Washington, said establishing the monitoring system ''creates a rubric in which a future administration might endorse the treaty.'' Senator Jeffords, a longtime treaty supporter, fought back on April 6, urging Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to persevere. ''We must avoid any weakening of our commitment to international nuclear test monitoring,'' he wrote in a letter with Senator Lincoln Chafee, a moderate Republican from Rhode Island. A few weeks later, on May 10, Secretary Powell told Congress that the Bush administration would seek $20 million for the test-ban work next year. That figure is what the program office in Vienna had requested. Secretary Powell is one of the few officials in the Bush administration to have supported the Senate's approval of the treaty, which he did in January 1998 along with three other former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Mr. Jeffords, in announcing his departure from Republican ranks on May 24, made no mention of the test ban or its monitoring. But aides said the topic was one of many where he foresaw growing disagreements with the Bush administration and Senate leaders. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers, a private group in Washington, said the Senate's shift into Democratic hands will aid the monitoring and ''make life far more difficult for the Dr. Strangelove caucus.'' If the United States and the 159 other nations of the treaty organization maintain their contributions, construction of the monitoring system could be completed by late 2005, Dr. Suarez said. That is somewhat behind the schedule envisioned a few years ago. By late this year, he said, his team will have finished surveying 90 percent of the proposed station sites around the world, many of which lie in remote or inhospitable regions. In the United States, despite the political clash over monitoring, 26 of 37 planned stations have already been built, a Bush administration official said. The White House might want to pull out of the monitoring program after it finishes its reviews of nuclear policy, the official added. But the president and his aides, though largely treaty opponents, will probably choose to avoid that step and the likely uproar. ''The politics are really hairy,'' the official said. ''They may want to let it limp along because of its high political profile.''"
"One of history's most violent volcanic eruptions blasted the island of Sumbawa in the East Indies in 1815. The sulfurous gases and fiery ashes from Mount Tambora cast a pall over the entire world, causing the global cooling of 1816, known as the ''year without a summer.'' The explosions killed 117,000 people on the island, now part of Indonesia, and wiped out the tiny kingdom of Tambora, on the volcano's western flank. The fast-moving avalanche of pumice and ash buried the town under 10 feet of debris, with only 4 of its estimated 10,000 residents surviving. A team of American and Indonesian scientists has now found remains of what it says is the ''lost kingdom of Tambora.'' In an announcement yesterday by the Graduate School of Oceanography of the University of Rhode Island, the scientists reported uncovering bronze bowls, ceramic pots, fine china, glass, and iron tools in gullies running through the jungle growth 15 miles from the volcano. Preliminary excavations, they said, exposed the carbonized framework of a house about 20 by 33 feet in size. The log beams, even some of the bamboo siding and thatch roof, are charcoal black, but the original shape of the house is preserved. Skeletons of two adults lay where they died, one of them clutching a large knife. ''There's potential that Tambora could be the Pompeii of the East, and it could be of great cultural interest,'' said Haraldur Sigurdsson, a geophysicist at Rhode Island who specializes in the study of volcanoes. The volcano is dormant, not dead. Twice since 1815, it has rumbled to brief life, mere burps compared with the destructive eruption that cost the mountain more than 3,000 feet of its height, reducing its elevation to 9,354 feet. The summit crater still smells of sulfur venting from the depths. Dr. Sigurdsson said in a phone interview that Indonesian archaeologists had examined the artifacts and were planning systematic excavations this year. Their first impression of the material suggested that the Tamboran culture was linked by ancestry or trade to Vietnam and Cambodia. Other archaeologists have yet to assess the find. The many bronze pieces and historical evidence from Dutch and, briefly, British colonial days, Dr. Sigurdsson said, supported the belief that Tamborans were ''not poor people at all, but actually quite well off.'' Dr. Sigurdsson and researchers from the University of North Carolina and the Indonesian Directorate of Volcanology made the discovery in late 2004. While they were conducting research on the volcano itself, a local guide told them of gullies where people were picking up strange objects. A six-week survey with ground-penetrating radar, capable of revealing material to depths of 30 feet, showed the outlines of boulders, terraced fields and the house. Spot excavations yielded more pottery and bronze, some bones and teeth, knives and a whetstone, even carbonized rice. The site on the volcano slope is about three miles from the coast, conforming to an island tradition of settling inland, a safe distance from seagoing pirates. Such towns were usually ruled by a king who lived in the largest house, a few of which have survived elsewhere in the islands. Next year, Dr. Sigurdsson expects to extend the radar survey, searching for traces of the rest of Tambora and perhaps the king's house. If Tambora is indeed like Pompeii, which was buried in an instant by the erupting Mount Vesuvius, the scientist said, ''all the people, their houses and culture are still encapsulated there as they were in 1815.''"
"Pompeii spreads out as a set for the grand finale staged by Mount Vesuvius, but it appears to have been more of an encore. Geologists and archaeologists are reporting new research today showing, they said, that the volcano erupted with even greater power and range nearly 4,000 years ago, in the Bronze Age. The findings, they add, are not reassuring to Naples and its metropolitan population of three million. Digging into sediments west, north and east of Vesuvius, Italian and American scientists uncovered beds of volcanic ash and pumice that buried land and villages around 1780 B.C. The devastation extended 15 miles from the volcano, the first evidence that a Vesuvius eruption ever spread so far and into the Neopolitan region and beyond. Pompeii, the luxurious resort of wealthy Romans and now the most famous still-life of volcanic doom, is just five miles southwest of Vesuvius. It was buried almost instantly in the eruption of A.D. 79. Although the loss of life and property was less in the Bronze Age event, owing to the sparse settlement, archaeologists investigating the sediments, more than three feet deep, found poignant evidence of panic -- tracks of thousands of footprints made in the ash, all leading away from the volcano. People in flight left their huts, food on the tables and livestock. Burned bones and skulls reveal that many did not make it to safety. The research, conducted over the last two years, is described in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The authors are Giuseppe Mastrolorenzo and Lucia Pappalardo of the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Naples, Pierpaolo Petrone of the Museum of Anthropology in Naples and Michael F. Sheridan, a volcanologist and risk analysis expert at the University at Buffalo. ''What is new,'' Dr. Sheridan said in a telephone interview, ''is that our research shows the effect this eruption had on the Bronze Age population that lived in the area, the size of the effect and the fact that this event was directed at what is now Naples.'' The findings also fill in more of the 25,000-year history of Vesuvius. Sedimentary studies have found that major eruptions have occurred at intervals of 2,000 to 3,000 years. The last event, in 1944 as Allied forces liberated Italy from the Fascists, was not major. So it has been roughly 2,000 years since Pompeii, Dr. Sheridan pointed out. ''With each year, the statistical probability increases that there will be another violent eruption,'' he cautioned. ''This research shows that Naples can no longer assume it is relatively safe from Vesuvius.'' Correction: March 13, 2006, Monday An article in Science Times on Tuesday about a newly discovered eruption of Mount Vesuvius, about 1780 B.C., misstated the location of Pompeii, the resort that was buried in the eruption of A.D. 79. As shown in the map with the article, Pompeii was five miles southeast of Vesuvius, not southwest."
"WHY GO NOW -- Lanzarote's other-worldly volcanic landscape is one of the most dramatic on the planet and is in danger of being consumed by package-deal tourism. While vast expanses of Lanzarote are protected by a national park and several preserves and Unesco designated it a Reserve of the Biosphere in 1994, there is still the quiet creep of development. The easternmost of the Canary Islands, part of Spain about 100 miles off the coast of Africa, Lanzarote is nearly 40 miles long, culturally rich and blessed with an average temperature of 72 degrees, which may be why its expatriate community ranges from surfers to the Portuguese Nobel Prize-winner José Saramago. For visitors, the island's mix of natural beauty, white-sand beaches and quirky lava-rock-studded architecture are usually enough to necessitate the purchase of an extra photo card during a weeklong visit. Much of that architecture is the work of César Manrique (1912-1992), a local artist and architect who set out to save the island from the destructive forces of mass tourism storming the Spanish coast in the 1960's. But there are other diversions. The postcard-perfect town of Teguise has art galleries, wine bars, historic churches and 18th-century palaces. Farther south, the towns of Yaiza and Uga mark the entrance to the wine-growing region, where camels are still used to harvest grapes. And everywhere, the wide-open landscape beckons, especially to those with an athletic disposition. Lanzarote and the tiny neighboring island of La Graciosa have become training sites for cyclists and triathletes. Fuerteventura, the big island to the south that has played host to the world's windsurfing championships over the last several years, is a short ferry ride away. And Lanzarote's newly created port of Puerto Calero is the embarkation point for fishing and scuba expeditions. WHERE TO STAY -- There are a growing number of trendy casas rurales, as small Spanish hotels are known, drawing an in-the-know mix of ages from across Europe. In the village of Mozaga, for example, the new Casa Tomaren, Calle Tomaren 33, (34-928) 520-818, www.lanzaroteinland.com, has six villas, from 60 euros ($74, at $1.23 to the euro), with Balinese-accented furnishings and full kitchens set around an 18th-century farmhouse, swimming pool and yoga pavilion. Minus the yoga and just across town, Caserio de Mozaga, Mozaga 8, San Bartolomé, (34-928) 520-060, www.caseriodemozaga.com, offers the same offbeat charm in its eight crisply maintained rooms, which have the benefit of being attached to one of the best restaurants on the island. Doubles in winter from 112 euros. Accommodations are split between these small hotels and the jumbo resorts clustered on the coast. Among the smartest resorts is the Hesperia-Lanzarote, Urbanización Cortijo Viejo, Puerto Calero (34-828) 080-800, www.hoteles-hesperia.es, which, while offering 335 rooms with water views, has adopted the island's indigenous low-slung, whitewashed architecture. There are several restaurants, a disco, live music in the lobby most evenings and a menu of spa treatments. Doubles start at 230 euros. WHERE TO EAT -- Across the island, Spanish, German, French or Swedish chefs are combining Lanzarote's varied seafood, abundant fruit and subtle cheeses with their own fusion enthusiasm. Casa Tegoyo, Carretera Coníl-Asomada 3, (34-928) 834-385, is among the more elegant locales owing to its location in a grand señorial home (now a small hotel with a gorgeous pool set in its tranquil garden). The menu is international but with an emphasis on local seafood and some inspired vegetarian dishes like a salad of chili-marinated tofu with avocado. Dinner for two with wine, about 80 euros. Highly recommended among the locals is Caserio de Mozaga, Mozaga 8, San Bartolomé, (34-928) 520-060, where straightforward but perfectly done dishes like grilled vegetables or filet mignon glow in the warm light of antique candelabra. Dinner for two with wine, about 70 euros. There are only about a dozen tables at Taberna Strelizia, Avenida Guanarteme 55, Tiagua, (34-928) 529 841, where French-accented dishes like scallops en papillote or asparagus in herbed cream and puff pastry stand out and the service is warm and attentive. Dinner for two, about 70 euros. WHAT TO DO DURING THE DAY -- A visit to Timanfaya National Park and the Mountains of Fire, (34-928) 840-057, a 20-square-mile sea of lava and exploded craters, allows one to easily imagine the onslaught of molten rock that formed the landscape 300 years ago. The park's restaurant even harnesses the volcanic heat to grill chicken and sausages (the temperature just four inches below the earth's surface averages 285 degrees). The 8 euro admission includes a bus tour of the lava fields, though the park can also be visited by camel (20 minute tours at 10 euros per camel), or on foot. The best place to start a César Manrique tour is his former home, now the Fundación César Manrique, Taro de Tahiche, Teguise, (34-928) 843-138, www.fcmanrique.org (7.5 euros). Built on a lava flow, it includes several underground chambers, or jameos, as the naturally occurring fissures and bubbles in the volcanic basalt are known in Spanish, done up by Manrique into swank salons in high 1970's style. Other Manrique sites include Los Jameos del Agua, Carretera de Orzola, (34-928) 848-020 (8 euros), an eye-popping series of caves and caverns with a subterranean lagoon that also happens to have a bar that stays open till 2 a.m. on weekends. There is also the mountaintop Mirador del Rio, (34-928) 526-548 (4.70 euros; includes a drink), with its breathtaking view of the sea and the small island La Graciosa floating some 1,500 feet below. Up north, the rough and rugged beach of Famara is surf-cowboy heaven. Against a backdrop of 2,000-foot peaks that plunge straight into the Atlantic, the kite- and windsurfers look like toys tossed around by the elements. Off the sand, surfers kick back (and toss back bottles of Dorada beer) in the Wild West dirt-road town. WHAT TO DO AT NIGHT -- Start it off at sunset on the terrace of El Chupadero, La Geria 3, Yaiza, (34-928) 173-115, set in the hills above the vineyards. Wash down some papas arrugadas (''wrinkled,'' spicy potatoes, 4.50 euros) or crepes filled with the local cactus marmalade (5.50 euros) with a glass of malvasia (2.50 euros). Bar Cueva (Cave Bar), at LagOmar, Los Loros 6, Nazaret, (34-639) 742-100, www.lag-o-mar.com, the fantastical house Manrique designed for Omar Sharif in the 1970's, is now a restaurant and bar (with two guesthouses available for weekly rental). Grab a drink (about 6 euros) and find your way along the tunnels, paths, patios and pools nestled into the volcanic rock. End the night at the recently opened discothèque Rumm in Puerto del Carmen, Plaza del Varadero. Designed by Tomás Alía, the high-profile Madrid architect, it mixes vintage mirrored-ball chic with a Moroccan inspired chill-out lounge on the terrace. WHERE TO SHOP -- There are shopping esplanades in Playa Blanca and Puerto Calero offering international brands, but for local products, visit a winery like Bodega La Geria, Carretera de la Geria km. 19, (34 928) 173-178, www.lageria.com. Tastings of the local malvasia (five wines for 3 euros) often lead to the purchase of a bottle (7 euros) or two. The German painter Anneliese Guttenberger and her husband, Stefan Schultz, a ceramist, moved to the island nearly 20 years ago and sell their works from their gallery-cum-studio/home in a traditional farmhouse. Atelier+Cerámica, Avenida Acorán 43-45, Teseguite, (34-928) 845-057. YES, FREE -- Climb around Los Hervideros (the Boiling Pots), on the western side of the island, a promontory of jagged basalt cliffs that make a roiling mockery of the crashing waves. Nearby is the tiny and charming fishing town of El Golfo, which sits next to the cove from which it gets its name. Here, a U-shaped half of a former volcanic crater shelters the beach where a vivid green lake has formed on the black sand. HOW TO STAY WIRED -- Most of the larger resorts have wireless or at least broadband access but there are several Internet cafes in Puerto del Carmen, including Cyberhall, Avenida de las Playas, (34-928) 512-152. YOUR FIRST VISIT OR YOUR 10TH -- Spend an afternoon on a beach at Punta de Papagayo, a nature preserve at the southernmost tip of the island, near Playa Blanca. The beaches nearer the parking lot (3 euros) are more family-oriented while the more remote ones, such as Caleta del Congrio, might be prone to nudity. HOW TO GET THERE -- From New York, via Europe, several airlines have fares for about $700 for mid-February, but the island is also served by many discount carriers from European cities. For example, Spanair offers mid-February fares from Madrid for $262. GETTING AROUND -- A rental car is easily arranged at the airport in Arrecife at Avis, Pepecar or Auto Reisen. Rolling along the undulating volcanic landscape, past tiny cactus farms and cubist-looking white villages, with the azure Atlantic on the horizon is one of the best ways to appreciate the island's charm. GOING TO"
"Significant amounts of aid began arriving Monday in Bantul, the town south of this city that was hit the hardest by Saturday's earthquake, but a nearby volcano substantially increased its threatening activity. For the third night in a row, residents in Bantul and in Klaten, another badly ravaged town, slept outside their houses, grouped around campfires and used debris for cover from the sporadic rain. Some softly strummed guitars, while others, kneeling on mats, prayed for help. Mount Merapi, a towering 9,800-foot volcano north of Yogyakarta, has been close to an eruption for nearly a month, but activity weakened in recent weeks. Volcanologists said Monday that the powerful quake destabilized a fragile dome at the mountain's peak. Collapse of the dome would set off a large eruption of lava, rocks and hot gas, they said. Large, billowing clouds of gas were vented from the mountain's crater on Monday, drifting more than two miles down its western slope toward the village of Magelang. Subandriyo, director of the Merapi division of the Volcanology Center here, said the volcano released 150 gaseous clouds on Monday, compared with an average of 50 the week before. ''Residents living in the danger areas on the slopes of the volcano have again begun to evacuate,'' he said. ''The danger is growing as activity increases.'' South of Yogyakarta, the death toll from the earthquake on Saturday rose to about 5,000, with more than 15,000 injured and 100,000 displaced, according to government figures released Monday. Puji Pujiono, the lead officer of the United Nations team in Bantul, said it was receiving no new reports of missing persons, a sign that the number of deaths might not increase much in the coming days. Emergency teams previously deployed in Yogyakarta for the expected eruption of Mount Merapi have shifted their resources to Bantul, where a command center for the rescue effort has been established. A communications post there is monitoring the volcano's activity and keeping emergency workers informed of developments. Activity at the command center in Bantul was high Monday afternoon as government, military and international aid workers, forming human chains, unloaded rice, water and other supplies. The Indonesian Finance Ministry told United Nations officials on Monday evening that it would provide subsistence grants to survivors of the quake. The ministry also said it would provide grants to families, administered by local government, to help rebuild houses. It intends to complete a full action plan for rehabilitation in two weeks. Despite heavy rain during the last three nights, officials said they did not expect large numbers of deaths from disease or hunger. Many residents are staying near their homes and in their villages, where they have been able to share salvaged food, clothing and shelter. But villagers who were ill or injured continued arriving at seriously overburdened hospitals on Monday afternoon. Officials said medical workers and hospital supplies were now the most urgent need. To partly relieve overcrowding, the Indonesian Red Cross began transferring patients with minor injuries to hospitals in Yogyakarta and to emergency tents in the quake area. The United States military said it would provide 100 doctors, nurses and medical technicians. A United Nations team from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs began organizing the arrival of aid groups on Sunday. Daily meetings have been held to share information and coordinate the use of resources. Electricity in Yogyakarta, a city of half a million, has been fully restored, and the airport, which was damaged during the quake, reopened Monday to emergency and commercial traffic. Aid shipments had been diverted to nearby airports in Solo and Semarang, where the relief groups loaded supplies and personnel onto trucks and vans bound for Bantul. The convoy of trucks caused heavy traffic along the road to Bantul, further delaying aid. ''There is a huge need here,'' said Mr. Pujiono, the United Nations official. ''We are not lacking supplies, but they are being held up by a jammed distribution system.'' On Monday, trucks, cars and motorbikes continued to wait in dense traffic on the one-lane road to Bantul, while villagers lined the street holding plastic cups and cardboard boxes begging for food and money. Emergency shelters were only beginning to go up on Monday. Andi Hanindito, chief of disaster response for the Indonesian Social Welfare Ministry, said the delay was partly because local government workers, who were caught in the quake, were only now returning to work. Relief groups, many of which were coming from Aceh Province in western Sumatra, where there was widespread destruction from the tsunami at the end of 2004, said their experience there helped them carry out the relief effort in Yogyakarta. Many aid group leaders are already acquainted with the United Nations staff members and government officials responding to the emergency here. ''Everyone is switched on here, and a lot of us know each other,'' said Rae McGrath, country director for International Medical Corps. ''Authorities here have so far been sensible and supportive.'' Local government officials have not been attending the daily coordination meetings, and the national government has yet to make a formal request for assistance from the United Nations. But Mr. Pujiono said he had been meeting regularly with local officials and communicating their concerns to other groups. The Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, temporarily moved his offices to Yogyakarta on Sunday, bringing greater pressure on the provincial government to respond efficiently."
"Mount Merapi has long been considered one of Indonesia's most unpredictable volcanoes. Its last major eruption in 1994 caught everyone by surprise when superheated clouds of sulfuric gas killed 66 people in this village on the mountain's high southern slopes. Today, scientists, who have been sleeping in their offices since activity first increased on April 12, have much better equipment to monitor the towering cone of 9,800 feet. Yet Merapi's fickle nature is evident from the graphs marking its activity. In sharp peaks and troughs, red lines rise and fall daily across a period of more than a month. Fears of an eruption increased significantly after a powerful earthquake struck the nearby Yogyakarta area on May 27, killing more than 6,200 and setting off a major rescue effort. The red lines shot off the chart as the earthquake's shockwaves slammed into the side of the mountain, disturbing the magma bubbling inside. Then the activity quickly dwindled. But over the last month, increasingly frequent tremors, lava flows and clouds of gas have suggested a significant eruption is about to occur. Subandriyo, head of the Merapi division for the Volcanology Center in Yogyakarta, who has been watching the mountain now for 10 years, said that given the current activity, it was unlikely Merapi would settle down without some sort of eruption. The lava dome, formed as magma seeps from the crater and cools, is now about four million cubic yards, growing by a few hundred thousand cubic yards a day, he said. ''The bigger the lava dome gets, the more unstable it becomes,'' said Mr. Subandriyo, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. When it collapses, he said, it will send a cascade of volcanic rocks tumbling down the mountain, accompanied by clouds of sulfuric gas, which can reach a temperature of over 550 degrees Fahrenheit. He said the lava dome was still fairly secure, though it was somewhat weakened after the earthquake. Most volcanoes have vertical eruptions, firing lava and debris high into the air. Eruptions at Mount Merapi, however, flow down its sides, affecting only the surrounding areas. Yogyakarta, an ancient city 20 miles south with a population of about a million, was badly damaged in the quake but will almost certainly be spared an eruption, Mr. Subandriyo said. One of Merapi's most serious threats are the hot gases, which escape the mountain's vents several times a day. So far they have reached villages closest to the crater, about two miles away. Once the gas clouds start extending more than three miles, Mr. Subandriyo said, it is time to worry. About 200,000 villagers live within about four miles of the volcano, and more than 30,000 of them live in the most vulnerable areas. A number of relief agencies who came to Yogyakarta more than a month ago to prepare for the eruption quickly diverted their aid to Bantul, the district hardest hit by the quake, more than 40 miles south of Merapi's southern slopes. The possibility of another disaster so soon after the earthquake has many aid agencies on edge. ''It would be a horrendous distraction to have two disasters, one from the north and one from the south,'' said Craig Owen, a spokesman for Oxfam, which was one of the first relief agencies to attend to victims of the earthquake, primarily because it already had a team monitoring Merapi. Villagers living on the mountain's slopes know Merapi's temperamental behavior all too well. They have evacuated and returned home and evacuated again countless times since the volcano first started showing increased activity more than a month ago. Thousands of villagers, mostly men, have long defied government orders to leave and continue to tend to their farms. Many, after numerous scares, have mastered the art of fleeing. Villagers often sleep in groups on the slopes, small fires keeping them warm, with someone keeping watch. Motorbikes and flatbed trucks are kept close by and communities have developed signals, like banging on lamp posts with hammers. Merapi first unleashed in grand form on May 15, when several large clouds of sulfuric gas poured out of its crater, sending villagers running for their lives and blanketing the volcano's southern and western slopes with ash. The local people and scientists prepared for a big eruption, but the lava dome did not collapse. It was stopped short by an unusual volcanic phenomenon, Mr. Subandriyo said. Usually, when the pressure of the gases magma rising inside the volcano's belly is released, they dislodge the lava dome, setting off a full eruption. But the new lava dome that has formed over the last month did so behind the remains of old lava domes, making it more difficult to dislodge. Mbah Marijan, a 79-year-old mystic who lives in Kaliurang, directly below the lava dome, has been appointed by the sultan of Yogyakarta to make annual offerings to the volcano. He receives a constant parade of villagers seeking advice on how to appease Merapi's rollicking spirits, which according to Javanese legend are now having a feast. Late one night last week, Mr. Marijan and a large entourage walked barefoot through villages in the shadow of Merapi's smoldering cauldron. In perfect silence they walked, adorned in ornate Javanese dress, praying for God to protect them. Traditional offerings of rice and other bits of food hang from doorways of the small houses, surrounded by green rice paddies, along Merapi's ascent. Many people here, in a population that is mostly Muslim but also includes those who harbor ancient animist beliefs, said Merapi was angry because its land has been pillaged. Volcanic sand is considered excellent building material and is used in construction throughout central Java. Despite the offerings and prayers by those who live on the mountain, Marijan said, their ultimate fate rests with God. ''I am not a scientist, and I am not psychic,'' he said. ''We can only pray for Merapi not to harm us.'' Correction: June 8, 2006, Thursday Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about the increased activity at the Mount Merapi volcano in Indonesia referred incorrectly in some copies to the distance between the volcano and the city of Yogyakarta, which is far enough away that it is unlikely to be damaged in an eruption. It is 20 miles, not 200."
"In the southern part of this city a short street once alive with guest houses, restaurants, travel agencies and souvenir shops now sits quiet, with barely a soul to be found, just weeks before the onset of the tourist season. The early morning earthquake on May 27 reduced the quaint street, Prawirotaman, to ruins. Throngs of half-awake, panicked tourists who were here that day and managed to survive relatively unharmed crawled out of rubble, wondering what to do and where to go. The 15 guests at Hotel Prambanan, a two-story inn with about 30 rooms in the popular low-budget backpacking district, were all spared serious injury, as were the other visitors staying nearby. ''Blessed be to God that no one was hurt,'' said Jahyanto, 39, the manager of Hotel Prambanan, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. ''They were confused and scared. I just tried to help them find the fastest way out of Yogyakarta.'' Yogyakarta Province is the second most popular tourist destination in Indonesia, Bali being the first. Ancient temples, palaces and a vibrant artists' community draw hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists a year to this area. Tourism accounts for about 20 percent of the province's income and is second only to agriculture as a source of revenue. Handicraft villages in Bantul, the hardest-hit district, supplied 40 percent of the souvenirs sold throughout Indonesia. Three thousand family kilns for pottery were destroyed in the quake, and most of the villages were nearly leveled. On Monday, an official from Indonesia's Social Affairs Ministry announced that the death toll from the quake had been revised to 5,782 from 6,234, saying that some victims had been found alive and that others had been counted twice, The Associated Press reported. Even before the quake, tourism here was threatened by fears of an eruption at Mount Merapi, just north of Yogyakarta. A marketing campaign to show tourists that Yogyakarta, 20 miles south of the volcano, is out of Merapi's reach began several weeks ago and included organized visits to the mountain's slopes. Two days after the program began, and the first tourists arrived at Mount Merapi, the quake struck. Yet tourism officials are optimistic that they can recover. Most of Yogyakarta's major tourist sites were undamaged and remain open, including the city's biggest draw, the Borobudur Buddhist temple, which is more than 1,000 years old and is a Unesco World Heritage site. ''Re-establishing the tourism industry here won't be easy,'' said Wiendu Nuryanti, secretary general of Yogyakarta's International Center for Culture and Tourism. ''But we are working together with a lot of different agencies to help the tourism industry.'' Along with local and national government officials, Ms. Nuryanti has created a task force to help rehabilitate tourism in Yogyakarta. The office of the task force, the Java Crisis Tourism Media Center, is busy with volunteers collecting data on damaged tourist areas. Regular meetings are held to discuss strategies for recovery. Indonesia's minister of culture and tourism, Jero Wacik, has already indicated that the government will provide subsidized loans to ruined businesses, and tax incentives for struggling hotels and tourist agencies. Condroyono, the provincial director of tourism, said strategies were being developed to use the earthquake and volcano as a way of diversifying tourism. Though Javanese culture will always be the primary reason tourists come here, he said, there are plans for tours to areas of geological significance, like massive fissures in the Gudung Kidul district, caused by the quake, or the ash-stained slopes of Mount Merapi. ''There is the potential for a kind of adventure tourism here now,'' he said. Indeed, in the last few weeks a large number of domestic and foreign tourists have brushed aside danger, driving to evacuated areas to take pictures in front of Merapi. Ms. Nuryanti said her task force planned a major campaign for Mount Merapi, trying to capitalize on the recent international news coverage. The volcano is an important symbol in Javanese culture. Its spirits are believed to protect the ancient kingdom of Yogyakarta, and the designs of many of the temples are modeled after the volcano's shape. Mr. Condroyono admitted that it would be a long time before most potential tourists saw Yogyakarta as something other than a disaster area. ''This will take a long time, more than two years probably, before tourism can start growing here again,'' he said. Standing alone among the remains of his former business, Mr. Jahyanto, the hotel manager, said all he needed was a little money to start again. ''Maybe it's a dream,'' he said. ''But it is the dream of everyone on this street to rebuild and reopen our businesses.''"
"In this village, one of the closest to Mount Merapi's ominous crater, sleep is often tenuous. Pak Darto, 50, slept only a half hour on Sunday, spending all night sitting cross-legged beneath a small window, out of which the peak of Merapi, mired in smoke and gas, glowed orange between two tall trees. Also beneath the window, in a jumble, slept his wife and three daughters, wrapped in thick blankets, keeping warm in the cold mountain air. In the distance, the volcano, considered one of the most unpredictable and dangerous in Indonesia, thundered. Wide trails of lava and volcanic rocks tumbled down its southern slopes, sometimes coming within half a mile of Mr. Darto's small, wood-framed house. About two in the morning, the crash of rocks grew loud, and his wife, Sri Semiyati, 40, awoke with a start. With a motion of his hand and a nod of his head, Mr. Darto assured her there was no danger. ''I guess it is a heavy responsibility,'' Mr. Darto said. ''But I don't think of it like that. This is my family and these are my neighbors. I simply have to protect them.'' Mr. Darto, one of the village elders who is respected for his intimate connection with the spirit world, is entrusted with the task of sounding the alarm in the event of danger, which would most likely arrive in the form of a fast-moving cloud of superheated gas, exceeding 540 degrees Fahrenheit. One such cloud, which Mr. Darto and his family remember well, burned 66 people alive here in 1994. The villagers said they must depend on Mr. Darto, because the government's alarm, which sounds like an air-raid siren echoing off the mountain's valley walls, comes too late. Earlier on Sunday evening, after a simple dinner of noodles and tea, Mr. Darto's wife swept the kitchen, his son tinkered with his motorbike and his daughters studied for final exams. Mr. Darto, a tiny man with a big smile, one that rarely leaves his face, sat watching the volcano, drawing on a hand-rolled cigarette. With that he stood up, his smile quickly departing and his eyes glaring at Merapi. His wife wandered out of the kitchen, his son looked up from his bike and his daughters abandoned their books. Together the family stood in the dirt courtyard, ash heavy in the air, watching to see which way a freshly ejected hot cloud would travel. It went west, and without a word they all returned to their activities. ''The worst of it is over,'' Mr. Darto said. ''Merapi will begin calming down now in the next few weeks.'' Scientists, who are often at odds with mystics like Mr. Darto, seem to agree that the danger around Merapi is receding. Subandriyo, head of the Merapi division of Yogyakarta's Volcanology Center, said the alert remained at its highest level, but could be reduced if activity continued decreasing over the next few days. Volcanologists have long feared that an unstable lava dome, forming around Merapi's peak, could suddenly collapse. Last week, however, a large piece of the lava dome slowly began to crumble, setting off a series of small eruptions. Its reduced size is now less of a threat, said Subandriyo, who, like many in Indonesia, uses only one name. Mr. Darto's family, along with about 100 other families living in this village, have refused to heed government warnings to evacuate for months now. Kinarejo is about three miles from the teetering lava dome, well within striking distance. Merapi first started showing increased activity on April 13. The villagers believe they know Mount Merapi's character as well as anyone, and will know when it is time to leave. And so they remain in their ash-covered houses, tending to livestock and guarding their homes from looters, lying awake at night, eyes and ears trained on the mountain. The last time Mr. Darto hammered his steel bell, drawing everyone out into the street, was May 15, when numerous hot clouds danced around Merapi's southern and western slopes. In the street, the villagers quickly debated the seriousness of the situation and radioed for a flatbed truck to move the elderly, women and children to the safety of refugee camps, a mile and a half down the slope, Mr. Darto said. They all returned later that afternoon. For generations, fathers and grandfathers here have taught their sons how to read the signs of a coming eruption. Mr. Darto now teaches his 16-year-old son, Mulyadi. ''Most importantly, I teach my children to meditate, to exercise their spiritual power, so they will be better in tune with the nature around them,'' he said. Although most here on the island of Java are Muslim, many still practice ancient animist beliefs. A kingdom atop Mount Merapi is considered one of the most important symbols in all of Javanese culture. According to Javanese mythology, history is now entering a time of great torment, a time of darkness and evil. This explains, Mr. Darto said, the May 27 earthquake 25 miles south of Mount Merapi that killed more than 5,500 people and also the 2004 tsunami, which left about 170,000 people dead in Aceh, Indonesia's northernmost province. Early Sunday evening, Mulyadi rushed into the kitchen to inform his father that the full moon had arrived, a dangerous omen, the son said. Indeed, scientists say the gravitational pull of a full moon can disturb the volcano's magma bubbling inside, increasing the chances of an eruption. Nevertheless, Sunday night passed without incident. After morning prayers on Monday, Mr. Darto crawled under a blanket beside his daughters and managed his half-hour nap, while Merapi continued to smolder outside the small window. ''We cannot protect ourselves from death,'' he says. ''That is God's will. We can only nurture our soul, respect our environment and pray that God will bless us in return.'' Kinarejo Journal"
"Rescue workers began Sunday to bury hundreds of victims of a landslide set off by a typhoon that loosened the slopes of a volcano in Albay Province in the northern Philippines, sending mud and debris down the mountain. The death toll as recorded by the Red Cross stood at 406 on Sunday, but officials warned that it would certainly climb and that there was little hope of finding more survivors. The Red Cross said that with hundreds of people still missing, and perhaps with entire families buried under the mud, the final death toll could exceed 1,000. ''There are many unidentified bodies,,'' Richard J. Gordon, the chairman of the Philippine National Red Cross, told The Associated Press. ''There could be a lot more hidden below. Whole families may have been wiped out.'' The National Disaster Coordinating Center reported Sunday, three days after the typhoon struck, that 309 bodies had been retrieved and that 298 people were missing. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo declared a ''state of national calamity'' on Sunday to hasten the release of government money for rescue and recovery efforts in the hardest-hit areas in the Bicol region, a group of several provinces in the eastern Philippines that are frequently buffeted by typhoons. ''All resources of the government will continue to be mobilized without letup as we pin hope against hope on the search for survivors,'' she said in a statement. The typhoon hit the region on Thursday, bringing heavy rains and strong winds that destabilized the slopes of Mayon, the country's most active volcano. Most of those killed lived in villages at the foot of Mayon. Mud and boulders cascaded down the mountain, crushing people in their path. Entire villages lay buried beneath thick, black volcanic sludge. Gene Villareal, an Albay official involved in the rescue efforts, said a mass grave was a necessary precaution. ''We opted to do this because we might have an epidemic, which could be expected because of the high number of evacuees and homeless,'' The Associated Press quoted him as saying. The typhoon, one of the strongest to hit the Philippines in years, downed telephone towers and power lines, plunging the region into darkness. Disaster officials estimated that at least 40,000 people had been forced to flee their homes, while local officials said the number of homes destroyed could be much higher."
"New in the 'Old and Cold' About a decade ago, Japanese scientists exploring the seafloor near the Japan Trench in the northwestern Pacific made a surprising finding. Using a remotely operated submersible, they collected a bit of volcanic rock only about five million years old. Yet this was on the 135-million-year-old Pacific plate, which was not considered an active volcanic area, but rather an ''old and cold'' bit of the Earth's crust. Intrigued, Naoto Hirano of the Tokyo Institute of Technology and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and colleagues spent several years using sonar to map the ocean floor in the region, hunting for volcanoes. In an online report published in late July by Science, they say they have found very small young undersea volcanoes in two areas about 350 miles apart. The researchers call them ''petit spot'' volcanoes and say they occur in areas where the Pacific plate has cracked as it bends and slides under the Japan Trench, in a process called subduction. Analysis of the lava that oozes from them showed that it came from the asthenosphere, the shallow zone between the crust and the upper mantle. This is in contrast to ''hot spot'' volcanoes like those in Hawaii, in which the molten rock is thought to rise in plumes from much deeper in the mantle. The researchers say there may be many more of these petit spot volcanoes around the world, in areas where subduction occurs and old plates are flexed enough to crack and let the lava through. Where Rays Do the Rotting People who live in wet climates know all about rot. Moisture creates fertile ground for bacteria and other organisms of decay to do their thing. So dead vegetation quickly turns into rotting vegetation. But what about more arid regions, where there is little water to go around? A study conducted on the Patagonian steppes in southern South America shows that in this semiarid region, sunlight is the controlling factor in decomposition of dead plant matter. The sun's rays, particularly ultraviolet-B ones, break down the organic carbon compounds in plant tissue, releasing carbon directly to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide and other gases. In the study, Amy T. Austin and Lucía Vivanco of the University of Buenos Aires exposed plots of dead native grasses to the sun, using various filters and controlling other elements like bacterial activity. Their results, reported last week in the journal Nature, showed that after nearly two years the organic matter was reduced by up to 40 percent. But the only variable that affected decomposition, the researchers found, was the solar radiation. Filtering out some of the UV-B radiation reduced the amount of decay. But altering the biological activity in the plots had no significant effect. The researchers say this direct photodegradation of organic carbon acts as a short circuit in the carbon cycle, as carbon travels directly from plant tissue to the atmosphere without passing through the soil. The finding also has climate-change implications, since long-term changes in cloud cover and ozone in the high atmosphere can affect the amount of ultraviolet light reaching the ground, and thus the amount of decomposition that takes place. The Root of Oil-Eaters' Hunger Of course, it's not just dead plants that decompose. Just about everything does -- even oil, which can be broken down by some bacteria. Scientists in Germany have announced that they have sequenced the genome of one of these oil-eaters, Alcanivorax borkumensis. It is a voracious degrader -- in cases of oil spills or other hydrocarbon pollution it quickly becomes the dominant microbe -- and the genome, reported in the journal Nature Biotechnology, shows why. Among other characteristics, the bacterium has genes that enable it to act on a variety of hydrocarbons, others responsible for the production of surfactants that emulsify the oils and enhance degradation, and still others involved in making biofilms that keep the bacterium just where it can do its best work, at the point where the oil and the water meet. A Comeback Story Proves a Cautionary Tale Thanks to publicity about their plight and the efforts of conservation groups, some endangered Caribbean sea turtles have made comebacks in recent decades. Nesting beaches have been protected, and a result has been large population increases in green turtles and other species. But researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography argue in a new study that the situation is more dire. Using an approach that blends history and ecology, the researchers say that both the number of nesting sites and the overall populations of green and hawksbill turtles have been greatly reduced from historical levels. Conservation efforts, they say, need to focus not just on a few large nesting sites, but also on marginal ones just holding on. ''We need to at least get these beaches on the radar,'' said Marah J. H. Newman, an author of the study, which appears this month in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment. She is a graduate student at Scripps, which is part of the University of California, San Diego. Ms. Newman, with the study's lead author, Loren McClenachan, and Jeremy B. C. Jackson, used historical sources like traders' records and pirates' journals to compile a list of nesting sites. Hawksbills were prized for their shells; greens were hunted for their flesh (flipping them over renders them helpless, so they were a ready source of fresh meat). The researchers found evidence of 59 nesting beaches for green turtles and 55 for hawksbills. Then, given all these known beaches, they used several approaches to estimate the historical population sizes of the two species. The estimates vary widely, but even the most conservative ones are many times current levels. ''There was incredibly extensive cover throughout the Caribbean,'' Ms. Newman said. ''Wherever there was a beach, there were turtles. You just don't see that now.'' The researchers found that about 20 percent of the historical sites had been lost, and half of the remaining ones were home to very small populations. But smaller sites, Ms. Newman said, are ''how a species hedges its bets'' in case a major nesting beach is destroyed by a hurricane or another disaster. ''It's really a weakness in conservation strategy not to put some effort into restoring these satellite beaches,'' she said. ''It's important to bulk those up.'' Observatory"
"How to tame a mud volcano: try dropping hundreds of giant concrete balls into it. In recent weeks, using a system invented at the Bandung Institute of Technology, workers have been releasing the balls from a complicated crane-pulley-sling contraption into the steaming vent known to scientists as ''the big hole.'' Mud volcano experts are bemused. No one has ever stopped an underground mud flow, they say, least of all with a home remedy like this. Don't laugh, said Satria Bijaksana, one of three institute geologists who devised the plan, standing at the rim of a vast, dull-gray sea of mud. ''I'm not just some crazy scientist throwing out wild ideas,'' said Mr. Bijaksana, 42, who holds a doctorate in rock magnetism from Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada. ''This is not a joke.'' The mud started gushing from the ground nearly 10 months ago when a shaft probing for natural gas pierced a pressurized aquifer about 9,000 feet underground. Since then about 1 billion cubic feet of mud has spread across two square miles. The mud has buried 12 villages and 20 factories, inundating roads and rice fields and displacing 15,000 people. It is still flowing, at more than 3.5 million cubic feet a day, and no one can say when it might stop. ''After two months, we realized that this was not stopping,'' Mr. Bijaksana said, ''so we started trying to figure a way to stop it.'' The idea is to jam the gullet of the geyser with 1,000 or more balls linked together like charm bracelets, in bunches of four, the biggest of them weighing about 175 pounds. Their mass and friction, as they tangle at the bottom of the shaft, should slow the flood to a manageable ooze, Mr. Bijaksana said. But their shape will allow the mud to seep past, avoiding the pressure that could cause it to burst from the ground elsewhere. ''We want to slow it gradually,'' he said. ''A month, two months, three months. But we don't want to block it.'' Richard Davies, a geologist at Durham University in Britain and an expert on mud volcanoes, is skeptical. ''I don't think they're going to stop it with this ball idea,'' he said in a telephone interview. He said the plan could work only if the underground crater were shaped almost perfectly like an hourglass, allowing the balls to accumulate in one narrow space. ''The underground plumbing of a mud volcano, I don't think, is going to be that simple,'' he said. More likely, he said, the balls would simply disappear, swallowed by a gurgling digestive system of hot mud. He dismissed the notion that some of them could be ejected like cannonballs. ''It's a bit of a David and Goliath situation,'' said Mr. Davies, who visited the site and wrote a paper about the eruption this year. ''You're plunking these balls into a vent that is 700 meters deep and the upper part 50 meters wide,'' or about 765 yards deep and 55 yards wide. Recently, officials have reported a decrease in the volume of the flow after the insertion of nearly 400 balls. But the volcano has fluctuated since the start, and Mr. Bijaksana said it was too early to know if his system was working. Not only scientists have doubts about this approach. Chief Sgt. Sumarono, a soldier stationed at the team's media center, told The Jakarta Post that local soothsayers had said spirits who lived in the crater would be angry after being hit by the giant concrete balls. ''The mud explosion happened because the spirits in the crater are angry,'' said Sergeant Sumarono, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. ''The insertion of the balls will only spark more anger. The soothsayers have already said there will be a new and much bigger burst. I believe this.'' Geysers of mud like this are not uncommon, Mr. Davies said, but most are brief and modest, many are under the ocean and few threaten populated areas. Hundreds occur in Azerbaijan, some in Trinidad and some off the coast of Nigeria, he said. A few small ones in the Mississippi Delta are remobilizing sediment from a mile or so underground. Most are natural eruptions of pressurized mud, he said, but they can also be released when drilling hits an aquifer far underground, and the water gushes out like a fizzy soft drink. The mud started flowing here last May 29 during exploratory drilling by an Indonesian gas company, Lapindo Brantas, which is controlled by the powerful welfare minister, Aburizal Bakrie. The company says it is not at fault, and it blames a major earthquake two days earlier with an epicenter about 190 miles away. Although some Indonesian scientists have spoken out to support that claim, Mr. Davies said he doubted the earthquake caused the volcano. Some critics have blamed the company's failure to insulate part of its drill hole, but Mr. Davies said it was not clear whether that could have prevented the rock from fracturing. Mr. Davies said he was one of only a few experts on the unglamorous subject of mud volcanoes. ''The igneous ones are the popular ones,'' he said. ''Mud volcanoes are the poor brother of igneous volcanoes. There are some fairly fundamental things we don't understand about them.'' Mr. Bijaksana said he and his colleagues were on their own as they took on the volcano, developing their own theories and methods, and their own instruments for dealing with mud. ''If it doesn't work, should I be worried about what faraway scientists say?'' he said. ''People could argue about this over and over again. But this thing is real. We decided to do something.'' SIDOARJO JOURNAL"
"Understanding Lava's Life All volcanic eruptions are spectacular, but those that include a violent lava fountain or two are among the most spectacular of all. A fountain occurs when a jet of hot gas throws bits of lava and cinders high into the air. The plume can be hundreds of feet high and reach 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Vulcanologists have never fully understood the mechanism behind a lava fountain. Some have thought that the propulsive gas bubbles out of the molten rock as it nears the surface and the pressure drops -- like the head on a glass of beer, only more explosive. Others have said the gas separates out much farther below and accumulates in a reservoir before it escapes and forces the lava out -- like a bullet being propelled from a gun barrel. Scientists from France and Italy have now resolved the issue, at least for a lava fountain that occurred at Mount Etna in Sicily five years ago. They used an infrared spectrometer to analyze a fountain that lasted 40 minutes and spewed molten rock as high as 2,000 feet. The instrument, set up about half a mile from the lip of the volcano, can detect the proportions of methane, sulfur dioxide and other gases in the plume. The scientists found that the proportions of certain gases were what would be expected if they separated from the magma at great depth (and high pressure), rather than near the surface (at lower pressure). The results were reported in the journal Nature. The researchers say the composition of the gas suggests that it accumulated in a reservoir about a mile deep before it was released and set off the fountain. The Secret Behind the Snap The closing of a Venus flytrap is far less violent than a volcanic eruption, but in its own way it is just as spectacular. The rapid motion -- the two leaves can close on a fly or other prey in about a tenth of a second -- is remarkable for a plant. It's also a bit mysterious. While scientists have long known that the plant starts closing when hairs within the leaf are mechanically stimulated, and while they have speculated on what occurs at the cellular level, the precise mechanism has never been fully explained. Now, Dr. Lakshminarayanan Mahadevan of Harvard and colleagues have shown the secret behind the snap. The action, they say, is a function of the changing curvature of the leaves; the plant stores elastic energy and then releases it suddenly. It's something like what happens to a curved tape measure when it is bent back on itself. It doesn't deform slowly, but quickly snaps instead. The researchers first studied the action by painting tiny fluorescent dots on the outside of flytrap leaves and using high-speed video to record the movement of the dots as the leaves closed. Then they created a mathematical model to describe the action. Their work is described in Nature. The researchers still don't have much to say about the cellular activity -- presumably the quick movement of water into or out of certain cells -- that underlies the closing. But the movement itself, they say, is determined by the leaf geometry. The leaf is curved in two directions, and bending in one direction causes stretching in the other. At some point the stretching gets to be too much, and the leaf deforms rapidly. Heroes of Engineering It's not exactly the Fantastic Four or Superman, but a new series of online comics celebrates some more down-to-earth action heroes: mechanical engineers. The monthly series, a collection of panels sponsored by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (anniversary9.asme9.org) highlights the achievements of engineers like Michael Owens, inventor of the automatic glass-blowing machine; Robert Thurston, an early proponent of engineering education; and, coming in March, Orville and Wilbur Wright. The series, which continues all year, was created by Capt. Vincent Wilczynski, an engineering professor at the United States Coast Guard Academy, and Ron Spellman, a Coast Guard petty officer and comic artist. For Zebrafish, That Certain Glow With its relatively small genome and its ability to produce mutations that are analogous to those in humans, the humble zebrafish is already a valuable tool in genetics research. But it just got better: researchers at the University of Houston have developed a transgenic zebrafish that glows according to its biological clock. The fish, which incorporates a gene responsible for the flash of fireflies, should help scientists better understand the genetic basis of circadian rhythms, the metabolic processes linked to cycles of light and dark. Already, the Houston researchers have used it to study how the circadian clock is kick-started in the developing zebrafish. ''What we've done is inserted a recombinant gene into the germ line of these fish,'' said Dr. Gregory M. Cahill, an associate professor and the co-author of a paper describing the work with Dr. Maki Kaneko in the open-access journal Public Library of Science Biology. In their work, the firefly gene is put under the control of a zebrafish gene that is a ''biological clock promoter'': it controls the expression of the firefly gene according to circadian rhythms. So the firefly gene produces more of an enzyme called luciferase during the morning than the evening. When zebrafish larvae are put in a special solution, the luciferase causes the larvae to luminesce. This glow, while faint, can be detected by a machine. When measured over time, it reflects the functioning of the fish's internal clock. With this approach, Dr. Cahill said, large numbers of larvae can be measured at once. ''You want to identify mutants where the clock runs too fast or too slow,'' he said. But mutations are rare, so a lot of zebrafish are needed. ''In theory, you can test up to 2,000 animals at a time with this,'' he said. Once clock-affecting mutations are discovered, they can be compared with the human genome to better understand the genetic factors behind jet lag or other conditions that affect the body's rhythms. Similar comparative work is being done with fruit flies and mice. But Dr. Cahill said the new technique had some advantages. Unlike fruit flies (and like humans), zebrafish are vertebrates. And they reproduce much more abundantly than mice. ''The nice thing about fish is that we can do lots of these, relatively inexpensively,'' he said. Observatory"
"An Elephant Forgets Unlike humans, most other mammals show little concern about the dead. Most pay scant attention to carcasses of fellow members of their species, and ritual burying or caring for bodies is rare. African elephants have always been considered an exception. They have been reported to become agitated when they come upon an elephant corpse, poking at it with trunk and feet. They are thought to investigate old bones and tusks in this way, too. Some researchers have even suggested that elephants seek out the bones of dead kin. (Elephant graveyards, however, are just a legend.) Karen McComb of the University of Sussex in England and colleagues systematically investigated this interest in bones, using elephants at Amboseli National Park in Kenya as their subjects. There is long-term data on more than 2,200 elephants in the park, so the researchers knew which animals were in the same family units, and could use bones of dead family members in the experiments. In the study, the researchers approached family groups in a vehicle, placing several objects -- bones or ivory from relatives, from nonrelatives, bones from other species like buffalo, and blocks of wood -- about 75 feet away. Then they drove a distance away and watched to see the elephants' reactions. If an elephant was interested in a particular object, the animal would smell it and touch it with the trunk and occasionally manipulate it with the feet. The researchers found that the elephants showed more interest in bones and ivory of their own species compared with those of other species or other objects. Between bones and ivory, the elephants were markedly more interested in ivory -- perhaps, the researchers said, because elephants sometimes touch the ivory of living elephants in social activities. But the study, reported in the journal Biology Letters, a publication of the Royal Society, did not find that elephants were particularly interested in bones or ivory of relatives. The researchers suggested that the reason elephants had sometimes been observed doing this was simply that they were more likely to come upon dead relatives in their home range. The Pinatubo Effect The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines threw millions of tons of ash and sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. All that gas and dirt reflected more sunlight away from the earth, causing global cooling and otherwise affecting the climate. Scientists in Australia have now determined another effect of Pinatubo. Its eruption, considered the second largest of the 20th century, lowered the average sea level. The oceans have been rising at a rate of about 1.8 millimeters (slightly more than one-sixteenth of an inch) a year since the 1950's. The rise stems from warmer temperatures, which cause greater melting of ice and also cause the oceans to expand (water takes up more volume as it heats up). But there is considerable variability in the rate of rise when viewed over a time frame of a decade or so. The reasons for this variability have not been well explained. John A. Church of the marine and atmospheric research division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization and colleagues developed climate simulation models to take into account the impact of Pinatubo and other major eruptions over the past century, using data on ocean heat content. Their analysis, reported in the journal Nature, showed that sea levels fell after eruptions because the ocean cooled. After Pinatubo (which has yielded the best data), the average level fell by five millimeters in about a year. The researchers found that this cooling effect slowly dissipated over a decade or possibly longer, causing a Pinatubo-related sea level rise of about half a millimeter a year after the initial dip. This recovery, in fact, appears to have contributed to a faster overall rate of sea level rise that has been measured since 1993 -- of about 3.2 millimeters a year, or nearly twice as much as the average rate since 1950. Advice to California Condors: Change Your Diet In trying to restore the California condor to the wild, conservation groups have run up against a potentially lethal problem: lead poisoning. The scavenging birds eat animal carcasses, including those left by hunters, which can contain lead bullet fragments. So conservation workers often leave stillborn dairy calves in condor areas as safer alternatives. But a Stanford scientist has a suggestion, based on his research into condor diets in the past. The scientist, C. Page Chamberlain, says that rather than eating lead-tainted carrion or relying on handouts, condors could go back to eating what they used to eat: seals, sea lions and other marine mammals. Along with colleagues from several other institutions and condor preservation organizations, Dr. Chamberlain analyzed the diets of three groups of the birds: those living at the end of the Pleistocene Epoch (11,000 to 36,000 years ago, preserved in the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles), those from more recent history (1797 to 1965) and those from modern times (1993 to 2001). The analysis was an indirect one, measuring the ratios of certain isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in bones and feathers from condor specimens. Different foods produce different isotopic signatures in the tissues. The group reported in a paper in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that at the end of the Pleistocene a significant number of condors lived on marine mammals. But by the 1800's, the diet had shifted to land mammals. The end of the Pleistocene was when many large mammals were wiped out in North America. ''The condors had nothing to feed on,'' Dr. Chamberlain said. ''They made it by feeding on the huge amount of seals and whales on the coast of California.'' In the 1800's the Russian fur trade destroyed seal populations on the West Coast, so the condors found a new source of food -- cattle, brought in by the Spanish missions largely for leather and tallow. The study also confirmed that the birds' diet now consists largely of the calves provided by conservation groups. ''Half their diet is what we are feeding them,'' Dr. Chamberlain said. ''It's almost like a zoo without walls.'' Since the study shows that condors can adapt, perhaps it is time for the birds to switch diets again, to the seals and sea lions whose populations are being restored along the California coast. ''The argument would be, 'They're on the beach; go get 'em,' '' Dr. Chamberlain said. Observatory"
"Lightweight and Lumpy Amalthea is a real lightweight. The moon, one of Jupiter's small inner ones, is a misshapen lump, about 160 miles across in its widest dimension, that orbits some 70,000 miles above the planet. But all that was known. What wasn't known about Amalthea was its density. But now, thanks to the Galileo mission's flyby in November 2002, scientists from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and other institutions have determined just how dense the moon is. The answer: not very. Amalthea's density, the scientists report in Nature, is less than that of water. During the flyby, the moon's gravity caused the spacecraft to speed up very slightly, which in turn caused a slight Doppler shift in the spacecraft's radio signals as received on Earth. The researchers used this shift to calculate Amalthea's gravitational pull, and since gravity is directly related to mass, the moon's mass could be calculated as well. (For the record, the mass is about 4.5 quintillion pounds.) Using images of the moon from Galileo and earlier Voyager missions, the researchers also calculated Amalthea's volume (about 600,000 cubic miles). Then it was simply a matter of dividing the mass by the volume to determine density, which is roughly 857 kilograms per cubic meter, about 85 percent of the density of liquid water. The researchers suggest that this means that Amalthea is a porous body made up of water ice (which has a lower density than liquid water) and rock. That makes it possible that the moon was formed in a colder part of the solar system and then captured by Jupiter, not formed in its current location. Picky, Picky, Picky What do ants want in a home? Well, like any house hunter, they want a reasonable amount of floor space. They want a nice-size entryway, too, and plenty of headroom. But researchers at the University of Bristol in England have discovered another criterion used by ants when they evaluate previously occupied sites for use as nests. They'll reject an otherwise perfectly good site if there any dead ants lying about. The researchers experimented by offering the ants, Temnothorax albipennis, a choice of two nesting areas of identical size. One of the areas had a few dead ants scattered about; the other had a similar number of grains of carborundum, roughly the same size. The ants preferred the nest with carborundum, regardless of whether the dead ants were from the same colony or were strangers. The findings were published in Biology Letters. Of course, it may not have been that the ants found the dead bodies repulsive; they may just have found the carborundum more attractive, because it could be used as a building tool. To test this, the researchers offered the ants a choice between a nest with carborundum and one with nothing at all. They showed no preference. In a previously occupied site, dead ants are an indication of hygiene problems, which may cause disease among the new occupants as well. So, the researchers say, you can add hygiene and disease risk to the long list of criteria that ants look for in a home. Out of Nowhere, a Volcano Scientists have documented the rapid growth of an undersea volcano in the Pacific near the Samoan Islands. The scientists, from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Scripps Institution of Oceanography and elsewhere, discovered the volcano growing out of the caldera of an existing underwater volcano. The new volcano, which they named Nafanua, is about 1,000 feet high and 2,000 feet below the surface. In 2001, the last time researchers visited the area, it did not exist; so it must have been growing at a rate of about eight inches a day. A growing undersea volcano is not unusual -- there are plenty of tectonic hot spots in the oceans where new material rises up out of the seafloor -- but it is rare to document the rise of one from nothing. Better Neighbors, With Horseradish Sometimes you've got to fight fire with fire. Sometimes, for instance, you've got to fight the overwhelming stench of pig manure with horseradish. Scientists at Penn State have discovered that minced horseradish root, added to a slurry of hog manure with a smidgen of calcium peroxide, can greatly reduce odors. Since foul smells emanating from manure ponds are a major complaint about large-scale hog farms in the United States and overseas, the research holds promise for making such farms better neighbors. Dr. Jerzy Dec, a senior research associate with Penn State's Institutes of the Environment, said the work arose out of earlier experiments involving phenols, chemicals used in various industrial processes that can pollute water and soil. Those studies had shown that horseradish contained an enzyme that was effective as a phenol remover. Researchers at Penn State, Dr. Dec said, are also interested in the issue of deodorizing animal waste. And manure contains phenols. So he and his colleagues did a few quick tests with horseradish. ''It seemed like it worked,'' he said. So they conducted more experiments, using trained odor evaluators. They found that a 1-to-10 horseradish to slurry ratio, with a small amount of peroxide, reduced odor intensity by 50 percent. To Dr. Dec, though, the experiments were not quite rigorous enough. ''I am a chemist,'' he said. ''To me, sniffing is not really an objective approach.'' So he ran samples of untreated and treated manure through a gas chromatograph and found that seven phenol compounds present in the untreated slurry were completely removed. The findings are reported in The Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. Dr. Dec said the horseradish enzyme used the oxygen from the peroxide to oxidize the phenol compounds to phenoxyl radicals, which interact with one another and form polymers. In their studies, the researchers effectively treated manure in 55-gallon containers. But Dr. Dec said he had no doubt that the process could work on a large manure pond. ''Moving to full scale wouldn't change the chemistry or the outcome,'' he said. The cost of such treatment should not be prohibitive. Horseradish is easy to cultivate; too easy, in fact. ''Essentially what it is, it's a weed,'' Dr. Dec said. ''It grows like crazy.'' Observatory"
"THE first sign of something suspicious on the lava field was a trail of carpet swatches leading to a cave. On Dec. 10 rangers in this Maui reserve, some of the most stringently protected lands in Hawaii, gingerly approached the concealed lava tube where Karen Mayfield, who is also called Harmony, had been living alone for three years. Deep in the recesses of the tube, a commodious channel with cathedral ceilings through which lava once flowed, they were astonished to find wind chimes, shelves made from Boogie boards and other ''unnatural items,'' including the four-poster that Ms. Mayfield, seeking ''spiritual attunement'' and a simpler lifestyle, had single-handedly hauled in pieces across the treacherously sharp and slippery lava field. Thus began the case of the State of Hawaii v. Ms. Mayfield, in which she was evicted from the tube. Like many landscapes created by Madame Pele, the goddess of volcanic fire, lava tubes have deep cultural and ecological significance, dating from the use of some as burial grounds for ancient Hawaiians. Ms. Mayfield, 50, faces three misdemeanor charges -- camping illegally, disturbing a geological feature and littering -- with a possible sentence of three years and a $6,000 fine. A trial is scheduled for July. ''It is a little kooky,'' David Cain, her court-appointed lawyer, said of her décor, which included a disco ball at the ceiling. ''But Henry David Thoreau was looked on as a kook.'' Now infamous throughout Maui as the Cave Lady, Ms. Mayfield, like many paradise-seekers before her, migrated to Hawaii from Oregon 24 years ago, giving up her small granny flat to live closer to the land. She calls herself ''not a survivalist, but a thrive-alist.'' She is the latest example of the new lava life, in which end-of-the-road hippies, retirees, architects and other intrepid pioneers are romancing lava, the more rugged and foreboding the better. Their dream of paradise is not 10,000-square-foot Tuscan villas, golf courses and helipads laid over the reptilian bleakness. Rather, they are creating new dwellings -- call them lavatopias -- over, under and above lava, pushing settlement to the outer fringes of topography and common sense. On the Big Island, the only island with active volcanoes, the stakes of lava life are highest: no other place in America combines a deep spiritual connection to the land with such a hot real estate market, sometimes literally. There, Madame Pele is the ultimate developer, churning out new (if not quite ready-to-build) real estate every year. At dusk in the Puna district of the Big Island, where Kilauea is still erupting, Craig Steely, a 40-year-old architect from San Francisco, gazes out the floor-to-ceiling windows of his modernist house floating ethereally on a 1955 lava field, admiring the caldera's crimson reflection some 20 miles away in the clouds. The simplicity of line, the sleek structure of glass and steel, is designed to be an elegant object framing the lava, ''a balance between rough and refined,'' he said. With two new houses in the works, Mr. Steely is doing for lava what Gwathmey Siegel did for Long Island potato fields. A client who lives in another Steely house, Robert S. Trickey, a San Francisco designer and upholsterer, keeps his furniture to a minimum so as not to compete with his vistas of jagged virgin lava. ''The Chinese had rock gardens,'' Mr. Trickey said dreamily. ''I have lava.'' He relishes the austere unconventional beauty of it all but has yet to set foot in his front yard, which he calls a ''reverse terrarium.'' Both he and Mr. Steely, who commutes from San Francisco to his lava pad with his wife, Cathy Liu, 36, a painter, and their son, Zane, 2, are well aware of the risks. ''There is an element of danger,'' Mr. Trickey said. ''But that makes life rich.'' The frisson may be easier to accept in a second home, Mr. Steely said. ''The volcano is so immediate and fresh,'' he said. ''You're constantly reminded how fragile life is.'' Indeed, the entire neighborhood is fragile, situated as it is on the East Rift of Kilauea (pronounced kee-loo-WAY-uh), in Hazard Zone 2. (Zone 1, which includes the summits of Kilauea and Mauna Loa, is the most dangerous.) Since 1955, when the volcano created the lava backdrop for Mr. Steely's architecture, some 28 percent of the area encompassing the East Rift has been covered by lava flows. The volcanoes here erupt not only at their summits, but also along rifts that radiate down from the summit. Since 1983, when Kilauea began its most recent eruption, 189 houses have been subsumed by lava in the Puna district alone, a relatively untouristed area where many Hawaiians still speak the original language. In recent years the mainland real estate boom has alighted on the Big Island, and prices in Puna are up 21 percent from last year. The pace of development in rift zones has become worrisome to scientists and civil defense people, with roughly 60,000 lots of one to five acres now lying in areas ''where there is a high degree of certainty they will be covered with lava flows in the future, whether it's 5, 50 or 5,000 years from now,'' said Don Thomas, director of the Center for the Study of Active Volcanoes at the University of Hawaii at Hilo. The concern has been heightened since Mauna Loa, which last erupted in 1984, has shown new life. ''When Mauna Loa goes, it goes big time,'' Dr. Thomas said, generating lava at about 10 times the rate of Kilauea, or about 600,000 cement trucks' worth a day. Subdivisions like Ocean View Estates (''Nice rolling lava lot w/coast and ocean views. No utilities. Lava zone 2. $15,900'') lie smack in Mauna Loa's treacherous path. Realty agents are required to disclose hazard zones, but there are no code restrictions on where people may build. And insurance rates for property in known risk areas -- Zones 1 and 2 -- are twice the rates elsewhere and typically cover damage from fire, not lava. The state insurance commissioner, Jeffrey P. Schmidt, said that as in precarious places on the mainland that are prone to earthquakes, floods and hurricanes, there is ''a tension between government trying to protect people and recognition of people's freedom to do with their property as they wish and accept the risk.'' Even inundation by lava. ''We're in the midst of a land rush,'' Dr. Thomas said, ''and it's 'Buy your piece of paradise.' It's a matter of understanding the implications. They're going to build their dream retirement home in paradise. And they're going to lose it.'' Richard Chadwick, 71, a retired United Airlines computer engineer from San Jose, Calif., knows all about that. When he looks out from his porch across his suburban lawn, Pele's teachings seem surreal. ''My boys learned to surf out here,'' he said bemusedly, glancing at a glimmering expanse of lava outside where the ocean used to be. The Chadwicks' original house ''went down'' in 1990, when lava from Kilauea virtually obliterated the fishing village of Kalapana. Mr. Chadwick and his wife, Donna, bought the beachfront house in 1977 after spying a recipe card on a telephone pole that said ''Beach house for sale.'' It was so close to Kaimu Bay that they could unwind on their screened porch and feel the spray. Only a chunk of foundation and a water heater survived. But inspired by ''memories of the old and the challenge of the new,'' Mr. Chadwick said, they decided to rebuild on the same spot, assisted by a D9 bulldozer. ''It's a different kind of beauty,'' he said one afternoon, watching a cloudburst cross the lava field, the rock turning slick, black and luminous. ''Not bad. Just different.'' ''It could happen again,'' he added. ''But would it?'' The answer may lie down Highway 130 -- what's left of it -- where what little remains of the Royal Gardens subdivision is reachable only by traversing a two-and-a-half-mile David Lean panorama of lava. Marketed as an affordable oceanfront paradise in the 1960's -- an acre was a prize on the show ''Queen for a Day'' -- Royal Gardens was one of a number of speculative subdivisions built notoriously close to the volcano. A series of eruptions, which continue today, basically buried it, leaving most owners with virtually worthless land they could hardly even find. The roughly 1,500 absentee owners pay $25 a year each in property taxes. Today this place of ghostly subdivision streets rising steeply to nowhere has one remaining full-time resident: Jack Thompson, the ultimate Lava Dude, who runs a bed-and-breakfast of sorts -- if you can find it. ''You've reached Jack's Lava House,'' his voice mail says. ''Go with the flow.'' To really reach Mr. Thompson's lava Shangri-La, however, requires trek of a mile and a half across an ebony Antarctica, navigating precarious chutes of lava in arrested motion and jagged glacierlike whorls and craters that crackle like ice. Mr. Thompson, a fit 55, rides across on his battered Kawasaki, guiding it through angry Rastafarian coils of lava by deciphering patterns in the rock. ''Every flow has a different texture and finish when it cooks,'' he explained as he zoomed across lava fields and up abandoned streets, blond ponytail flying. ''It's a rodeo out there, I tell you.'' Mr. Thompson was 25 when, like many of his former neighbors, he took advantage of a free real estate junket and built a house at ''the end of the road of the world.'' He had fantasized about such a spot since he was a boy, reading about black sand beaches in the encyclopedia to escape an abusive family member. He was putting in the last window when ''it'' started, but somehow the house survived, leaving him, as he put it, ''stuck with Madame Pele in paradise.'' Against all odds, he has opted to stay, his renegade one-man oasis on the southeast slope of the volcano brimming with plantings: pineapples, banana trees, tomatoes, four varieties of avocados, mangos, Okinawan tangerines, date palms, Key limes and orchids transplanted from a friend's house before it went down. His self-sufficiency is aided by a rainwater capturing system, solar panels, 12-volt batteries and money saved from occasional visitors and 15 years of installing air-conditioners and swimming pools. He had not intended to be the Robinson Crusoe of lava, but the role suits him. ''No bugs,'' he said. ''No weeds. No cars. No kids. No dogs. No roosters. It's real easy to get used to.'' At night he sits on his deck and watches the show: molten rivers of lava flowing from a vent at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, about four miles from his house, making their way through underground lava tubes toward the ocean, occasionally flaring and flickering like distant bonfires. He has been evacuated once, so far. ''I never really wanted to live in a regular neighborhood,'' he said over a dinner of spaghetti _ la lava. ''It's an improvement.'' He didn't like the neighbors anyway, whom he described as a bunch of crazy surfers. ''I don't surf,'' said the Lava Dude. ''Too dangerous.'' Harry Kim, the mayor of Hawaii County, who oversaw the evacuation of Royal Gardens and Kalapana, among other places, during his 24 years as director of civil defense, is, like many Hawaiians, philosophical about the lava life and its risks. The Hawaiian word for family, he noted, is ohana, a term that embraces rain, flowers, birds, trees and sky. ''You live here awhile, and your perspective changes,'' he said. ''Pele is a recognition of a power greater than mankind. She needs to cleanse, expand and grow. What makes nature destructive is mankind building in harm's way.'' On Maui, where Karen Mayfield's hippie kitsch décor in the lava tube will be an exhibit at her trial, the issue is one woman's starry-eyed domestic vision -- her moonlit disco ball casting shimmers around the cave -- and whether it disrespects both nature and culture, including possible archaeological artifacts in the cave not yet inventoried. In a hearing Mr. Cain, her lawyer, said that authorities had no right to evict her, arguing that ''there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, wherever you live, even if it's a cave.'' But many have found her creative sparkle, inspired by epiphanies of ''letting go,'' deeply troubling. ''Pele, the goddess of lava, created these tubes,'' said Charles Kauluwehi Maxwell Sr., a native Hawaiian and chairman of the Maui/Lanai Islands Burial Council. ''They are considered sacred. She had no business in there. It is a cultural insult.'' When the molten lava that destroyed Kalapana in Puna stopped at Robert Keliihoomalu's stone wall in 1990, sparing his home, he took it as a sign. ''The lava is your neighbor,'' he said. ''It's God's way of keeping you on the straight path.'' On what was once the fabled Black Sand Beach beside his house, well-wishers have planted coconuts in the lava, which now crack open with new life. It feels like a shrine."
"Every 300,000 years or so, a piece of earth about the size of Rhode Island slides off the side of a Hawaiian volcano and falls into the ocean. The splash -- a disastrous ocean-size version of tossing a pebble in a pond -- sends rings of waves 100 feet and higher radiating outward until they crash, catastrophically, against shorelines around the Pacific Rim, from California to South America to Australia. Writing in the current issue of Nature, scientists at the United States Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory report that they have, for the first time, directly observed a sudden slip of a volcano slope. This particular slip moved only a few inches and does not presage a collapse, the scientists said, and it demonstrated that satellite monitoring systems could provide weeks or months of warning of a collapse. ''I like to say these flank collapses are like meteor impacts,'' said Dr. Peter Cervelli, a research geophysicist at the observatory and an author of the paper. ''It is indisputable they occur. It is indisputable when they occur, they cause catastrophic damage, but we also know their occurrence is very rare.'' The southern flank of the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii, a possible location of a future giant landslide, is continually in motion without posing any danger, sliding at a glacial rate of three to four inches a year. On Nov. 8, 2000, the motion suddenly accelerated by factor of several hundred, with some parts of the slope moving as much as half an inch over the course of one day. A person standing on the ground there would not have noticed anything, but sensors on the volcano communicating with global positioning satellites made note of the shifts. The movements were similar to what scientists would expect for the beginnings of a catastrophic flank collapse, but in this case, the accelerated motion lasted only a day and a half before returning to its normal crawl. Scientists at the volcano observatory say that unlike earthquakes, where a swarm of small temblors may signal a large quake to follow, the small slip is not a sign of larger slips to come. ''It's not a priming,'' said Dr. Asta Miklius, a geophysicist at the observatory and another author of the Nature paper. But the scientists were interested in understanding what had moved deep underground to cause the surface shifts. Their computer models indicate that a 9-mile-by-3-mile slab located about 2 1/2 miles underground slipped about 3 1/2 inches, pulling along the ground above it. The event was equivalent to a magnitude 5.7 earthquake, they said. The scientists hypothesize that heavy rainfall nine days earlier -- three feet of rain in 36 hours -- may have been the cause, either by lubricating the underground fault or by adding weight to the slope. In an accompanying commentary, Dr. Steven N. Ward, a research geophysicist at the University of California at Santa Cruz, describes in detail the devastating destruction a flank collapse would unleash with up to 1,200 cubic miles of rock sliding at speeds of up to 100 miles an hour for 20 to 40 miles. The eruption of Mount St. Helens, by contrast, blew away only three-quarters of a cubic mile of material, Dr. Ward said. The slide would be the trigger for giant waves known as tsunami. ''It's going to stir up a pretty big wave,'' Dr. Ward said. ''You can visualize the large wave getting started and propagating across the Pacific.'' Dr. Ward's computer simulations indicate that a series of about 20 waves about 100 feet tall would scour the California coast. Smaller, but still devastating, waves would wash up along South America, Australia and islands in the Pacific. But because flank collapses are so rare, ''I don't lose any sleep over it,'' Dr. Ward said. He estimates that one occurs somewhere in the world once every 10,000 years. Debris from the last collapse of Kilauea's flank has been dated at more than 200,000 years old. The paper by the scientists in Hawaii, however, shows that the monitoring system on Kilauea provides a useful model for watching other oceanic volcanoes should the unlikely calamity occur. ''These things ought to be at least kept an eye on,'' Dr. Ward said."
"There are now two Gomas, divided by a rugged, scorching mass of hardened lava. The only way across is by dancing on hot coals, lifting each foot fast enough that it doesn't burn. Thousands of displaced Congolese returned here today from Rwanda. They fled after the worst volcanic eruption Africa has seen in a quarter-century began on Thursday. Rwandan authorities opened two camps for them well away from the disaster, but most of those who left town chose not to stay at the camps, preferring to suffer through the aftermath on home soil. One of the many who danced across the lava today stumbled on a jagged edge and fell forward onto his palms. He screeched in pain, lifted his hands to his face and inspected the burns. A young boy yelled, ''I don't want to go! It's hot!'' as his mother, her arms full and her back carrying another child, pushed him onto the lava that spewed out of Mount Nyiragongo last week onto the streets of Goma. Another refugee carried a live chicken along, dangling it by its legs. The bird squawked loudly whenever its head bounced across the lava. Ali Twaha, 25, whose house miraculously survived a lava flow that stopped near his front door, lifted one of his boots to show a partly melted sole. ''You feel the heat going up your legs,'' he said. ''You feel it in your whole body.'' The sizzling stone is just one of Goma's hazards. Toxic gases seeping through the lava sting the eyes and clog the lungs. Refugees roam in search of scarce food and water. Criminals raid abandoned houses and shops after dark. Fresh-faced rebels armed with automatic weapons, participants in the seemingly endless Congolese civil war, are the only government in sight. ''Oh, Goma has suffered so,'' said a nun who roamed the lava in her habit in search of needy souls. She had arrived from Kigali, the Rwandan capital, to evacuate 100 children whose orphanage had been surrounded by the river of lava. That the building withstood the heat was a success story, she said, but one of far too few in Goma. What was more common was the fate of Agate Kahambu, 25, who sat a few feet from the steaming lava, sucking in the gas and daring the volcano to strike again. Her house had been buried, enveloped by the innards of Nyiragongo, one of two active volcanoes in the region. ''If it wants to come and get me, then come and get me,'' she said. ''My house is already gone. It's covered with rock. I'm not going to let the volcano chase me away.'' It was despair, not defiance, that filled the face of Awete Emilie, a grandmother whose house was stolen by Nyiragongo. She showed a visitor the place where she used to live, now just a mound of black rock. ''It came this way and then kept coming,'' she said, gesturing toward Nyiragongo, miles away in a thick post-volcano haze. ''We ran for our lives when it was coming right at us.'' The United Nations, which has pulled most of its staff out of Goma, joined the rebels in urging the displaced Congolese to stay away from town for now. Volcano experts flown over the site by the United Nations have said that the intense shaking of the ground that still occurs regularly in Goma indicates that the volcano's activity may not be over for now. Goma is rebel-held territory, meaning the town's only authorities wear camouflage and are more adept at gaining ground than rebuilding on it. Members of the rebel group, Rally for Congolese Democracy, have called on aid organizations to ratchet up their relief effort. But the rebels have rebuffed offers of aid from the Congolese government in Kinshasa, the capital, that they are fighting. ''This is a natural disaster,'' insisted the rebel commander, Adolph Onusumba Yemba. ''It has nothing to do with politics and has nothing to do with the war we are fighting.'' Rebel leaders had urged residents to stay put in the early hours of the eruption, switching gears only when it became clear that the ash spewing from Nyiragongo was the real thing. Today, the rebels urged residents of Goma to stay out of the city, a call that fell largely on deaf ears as tens of thousands of people returned for a glimpse at the destruction. The World Food Program began feeding refugees at two camps in the western Rwandan towns of Nkamnra and Mudende, more than 10 miles from the Congolese border. Only about 5,000 people had arrived at the camps as of today, a small portion of the estimated 300,000 people initially forced from their homes. But a United Nations spokeswoman, Laura Melo, said the food might draw more to the camps in the days ahead. ''We are trying to sensitize people to go to the camps,'' Ms. Melo said. ''That will be the best place to be. But these people are victims of a natural disaster, and we can't prevent them from going home if they want to.'' Some refugees said they feared they would be worse off living in the camps, with their often crowded conditions and disease, than if they returned to Goma. Many have vivid memories of the dismal conditions and brutality of the camps in Congo for refugee Rwandans who streamed over the border nearby after the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. Refugees also complained that some Rwandans had rudely shooed them away when they first arrived. The question on the minds of many was whether Goma could recover from such a blow. There was ample evidence that the devastated town that has endured so much would somehow go on. In the rubble caused by eruption last week, there were neat walls made of lava left over from even more devastating eruption by the same volcano in 1977. There were many people like Muhammad Mustaf, who, standing today looking at the destruction, vowed to remain in Goma until his last days. Mr. Mustaf had been in a hospital bed with malaria on Thursday when someone rushed into his room and told him to run. ''I was in a haze,'' he said. ''I didn't understand. Everybody was running and they told me to go.'' He was still sweating today, a mix of fever and the steaming rock. The hospital managed to survive but Mr. Mustaf said he preferred to recover on his feet, just in case Nyiragongo was not finished yet. International"
"One of the first babies born since the eruption of Mount Nyiragongo last week was named Volcano by a woman who was still in search of two of her other boys. Men with sledgehammers helped build a road across the mound of lava dividing the town. In these and other ways, life began returning to normal in Goma today as residents lined up by the thousands for the first food and water that many had received in days. But normal is a relative term for Goma's people, who have lived through a long string of miseries in recent years. Through dictatorship and disease, rebels and Mother Nature, the people have endured. Nowdays the town is controlled by the Rally for Congolese Democracy, whose mission to overthrow Joseph Kabila, the new president, has been dramatically upstaged by Mount Nyiragongo's eruption. ''Not everybody supports us,'' acknowledged a rebel commander who identified himself only as Frank. ''If people are starving, they don't want us. If they're O.K., they do.'' The eruption and its aftermath have indeed left people desperate and near-starving, which may explain why the rebels have been eager to coordinate the relief effort since the eruption last Thursday. Rebel leaders have been negotiating with the United Nations over the best place for feeding sites and camps, and they have rebuffed attempts by Mr. Kabila's government in Kinshasa to get involved in the recovery. Mr. Kabila has offered aid as long as it stays out of the rebels' hands. ''We're not going to let him use this tragedy for his political propaganda,'' said Moïse Nyarugabo, the rebels' justice minister. Many here express weariness with political machinations and the violence that can result from them. ''Government workers go months, even years, without getting paid,'' complained an elderly civil servant who has lived through many of Goma's past travails. ''Everyone's jobless. Life has become so difficult.'' The man said he wanted the rebels gone, but after he said it he insisted that he not be identified in print. ''If you say the wrong thing in Goma it can mean trouble,'' he said. Trouble here dates back at least to the early 1990's, when Mobutu Sese Seko ruled the country, which during his years in power was called Zaire. The only properly paved road in Goma in those days ran in front of Mr. Mobutu's lake-front residence. In 1994, a wave of a million Rwandan refugees swept across the border into Goma to flee ethnic massacres. The refugee camps set up in Goma would later become the scene of violent clashes and cholera. Eventually, Rwandan soldiers swarmed into Goma to root out extremists among their refugee countrymen. When that was over, Rwandan-backed rebels intent on overthrowing the government of Laurent Kabila, Mr. Mobutu's successor, took over the town. Since Laurent Kabila's assassination in January 2001, the rebels' animus has been directed against his son, Joseph. ''Goma has lived through a longer series of incredible crises than any other place on earth,'' said Paul Stromberg, an official with the United Nations refugee agency. Late last week, in the hours after the volcano poured a lake of lava on much of its downtown, Goma became a ghost town. Today, money-changers holding bricks of Congolese francs reappeared, and families moved back into the homes that Nyiragongo had spared. The first vehicle to cross the lava since Thursday was a white four-wheel-drive of one of the many relief organizations here. Still, the ground continued to shake in tremors that cracked walls and rattled nerves, and volcano experts rushed into the night to check into reports that a second volcano near Goma may be rumbling. The United Nations evacuated one of its buildings tonight when a particularly vigorous rumble tore through the town. A boy roaming around the mass of lava in the center of town found two charred skeletons that appeared to be those of children. The bones were in the kitchen of an engulfed house, indicating that the two huddled together as the lava filled the room. The death toll is still unknown, but this was probably the first of many such finds."
"Mount Nyiragongo sent more lava flowing down toward the city of Goma today, in the third day of eruptions that have killed up to 40 people. Most of the town's 400,000 residents had already fled and were struggling with living on the run. Goma is across the border in Congo, but aftershocks could be felt as far away as the Rwandan capital here, about 60 miles away. The streets of some towns in western Rwanda were deluged with refugees, who camped outdoors and scrounged for food and water. Other residents were stranded by the river of lava to the west of Goma, out of the reach of international relief workers. Adolphe Onusumba, the leader of the rebel group that controls Goma, issued an urgent plea for help. ''We are asking the international community to come here and bring aid,'' said Mr. Onusumba, whose group is backed by Rwanda. He told displaced residents whom he visited by helicopter, ''We are doing everything we can to help you.'' Nyiragongo erupted on Thursday, and each day the plight of refugees has worsened. Mr. Onusumba estimated that 10,000 homes had been destroyed, representing 40 percent of the city. Most of the central business district was also wiped out, including warehouses holding food supplies, Mr. Onusumba said. ''There is no food, no water, no sanitation,'' one refugee, Richard Mwambo, said in an interview with Reuters after taking a 12-hour ferry ride across Lake Kivu to Bukavu. ''We are here like animals. We're afraid of dying.'' Biamungu Bizimungu, who has polio, was pushed in his wheelchair out of Goma across the border to Gisenyi by a good Samaritan. ''I haven't eaten since yesterday,'' he said in an interview with Reuters. ''I'm waiting for someone to push me away from here.'' The United Nations and other private aid groups struggled to organize a response to the crisis. All at once on Thursday, hundreds of thousands of people found themselves running for their lives, grabbing whatever they could hold in their hands or balance on their heads. Chaos swept the region today as some people tried to return home even as other residents of Goma were moving further away from Nyiragongo, one of two active volcanos in the area. ''The situation in Gisenyi is chaotic,'' said Bishop John Rucyahana of Christian Aid. ''There is no control over people's movements. Things are out of control and people do not know what to do.'' Still, aid workers have a heavy presence in the region, and the airport here was full of additional reinforcements arriving. A United Nations cargo plane arrived with tons of plastic sheeting, blankets, water cans and medicines, officials said, and similar flights were en route from around the world. The Rwandan government proposed 26 sites for resettling people displaced by the eruption, relief workers said. Each site would hold 22,000 people. Drinking water remained a major concern as the lava destroyed water treatment plants, and the authorities fear that volcanic ash may have poisoned the waters of Lake Kivu as well. United Nations officials said at least 40 people had died because of the eruptions, The Associated Press reported. Officials in Gisenyi recorded 16 deaths, but said a definitive count was not possible because of the chaos. Dr. Cedrique Abeli of Gisenyi Hospital said the 16 dead included 2 infants and 2 elderly burn victims. The doctor and four colleagues struggled to treat the injured as the hospital's wards filled with dozens of burn victims and women who suffered miscarriages brought on by stress. More than a dozen earthquakes shook the region every hour, some of them severe enough to send people running into the street in panic. Stephen Johnson, of the United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, told The Associated Press from New York that there were no indications that the eruptions, which began Thursday, had finished. The 11,381-foot Nyiragongo and 10,022-foot Nyamulagira volcanoes are the only active ones in the Virunga chain of eight volcanoes running east into Rwanda. The last major eruption of Nyiragongo was in January 1977. Brian Baptie, a volcano seismologist at the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh, Scotland, said Nyiragongo was one of the most active volcanos in Africa. ''Although the lava moves quite fast going down the flanks, once on flat land it moves quite slowly, so people can get out of the way if they have warning,'' he told The A.P. ''It's the refugee problem created that's the big cause for concern.'' The United Nations has sent several thousand military observers and peacekeepers into Congo after a cease-fire in the civil war that started in 1998 in Goma. Britain will give $2.9 million to help victims, with $1.4 million already allocated to aid agencies in Congo, said Clare Short, the international development secretary. International"
"THE LAST DAYS OF ST. PIERRE The Volcanic Disaster That Claimed Thirty Thousand Lives. By Ernest Zebrowski Jr. Illustrated. 291 pp. New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press. $27. ON May 7, 1902, the Danish steamship Nordby crossed a mysterious quadrant of sea in the Grenadines identified on seamen's charts as ''Kick 'Em Jenny,'' and suddenly found itself assaulted by 20-foot waves that came from all directions, even though the air was still. Sharks leapt from the sea. Seabirds seemed terrified. ''But the queerest part of it all,'' the captain wrote in his log, ''was the water itself. It was hot -- not so hot that our feet could not stand it when it washed over the deck, but hot enough to make us think that it had been heated by some sort of fire.'' The fire in this case was very likely an undersea volcano brought to life by the same vast welt of pressurized magma that within 24 hours would cause the eruption of Mount Pelée on Martinique and incinerate the elegant city of St. Pierre, ''the Paris of the Antilles,'' at a cost of 30,000 lives. In ''The Last Days of St. Pierre,'' Ernest Zebrowski Jr., who investigated a series of natural disasters in his earlier book ''Perils of a Restless Planet,'' tells the story of this eruption and of the petty colonial politics that kept officials from evacuating the city despite warnings of cartoon clarity: stratosphere-piercing smoke, thunderous detonations and a hail of rocks and scoriae, which, Zebrowski tells us, are bits of airborne magma cooled into brittle flecks of rock. What Zebrowski does best is capture the slow, creepy unfolding of the disaster, and the failure of the brick-brained men in power, or anyone else, to recognize that something very, very bad was about to take place. A man and woman stray from a picnic on the volcano and discover fumes drifting from the base of a dead tree, but of course think nothing more about it. Snakes and insects begin migrating down the mountain to escape the increasingly inhospitable atmosphere, with thousands of ants and centipedes finding solace in the sugar warehouses of the island's wealthy refiners. Undersea telegraph cables fail mysteriously. At one point, investigators climb the mountain for a look at its two existing craters and discover that a previously dry one, the _tang Sec, is now frothing with an ominous gray liquid. They notice too that the silver buttons of their vests have suddenly tarnished. The day before the mountain exploded, another volcano, La Soufrière, erupted on an island well to the south. Incredibly, residents of St. Pierre saw this as a positive development, believing the event would ease the pressure mounting within the earth. One official argued that evacuating the city would only heighten property losses from an eruption because there'd be no one to fight the inevitable fires. Even as Mount Pelée blackened the sky, the Martinique newspaper Les Colonies asked, ''Where better could one be than in St. Pierre?'' Zebrowski, however, is cautious to avoid laying too much blame on government officials for failing to evacuate the city, recognizing that scientists of the age knew very little about volcanoes and their behavior. Indeed, the Martinique eruption solved a mystery that had lingered since the Krakatoa disaster of 1883, which killed 36,380 people. Three thousand of Krakatoa's victims were burned to death even though they were 24 miles or more from the volcano. As Zebrowski observes early in the book, the mystery was this: ''What agent of destruction could possibly travel horizontally across 24 miles of sea, surge uphill and still be hot enough to inflict fatal burns?'' A scientist caught in the Mount Pelée eruption put the question more vividly just before his burns killed him. ''What on earth has happened?'' he said. ''Will someone please tell me what happened?'' The question is the central engine of Zebrowski's narrative, and as such must remain unanswered here; I'll say only that the explanation he presents is satisfyingly eerie and leaves a lasting imprint on the imagination. The main flaw of Zebrowski's book is its failure to capture the lives of any of the eruption's victims in enough detail to let readers experience the true depth of their terror and grief. Though the death toll was staggering, the number somehow remains merely a desiccated statistic. A good part of the problem, of course, stems from the fact that the eruption occurred a century ago, and all Zebrowski had to work with were diaries, letters and other written accounts. Still, turn-of-the-century correspondents were a generous lot, and to anyone who cares to look their writings often yield details that can blow the dust from the past. Zebrowski did find many such sources, but too often he makes the mistake of simply reproducing large portions of text rather than mining his material for its most precious elements. In one long, unnecessary chapter, for example, he reproduces newspaper articles that appeared in the aftermath of the disaster, even though none of these articles are sufficiently distinctive or gripping to merit so much narrative ground. The problem with long stretches of borrowed text is that they grow repetitive, and their best, most vivid, components lie buried like catfish in mud. They also flatten the narrative arc and invite the sin of skipping. With more writerly intervention, more picking and choosing, Zebrowski could have invested his story with far greater emotional power, for many of his eyewitnesses wrote with striking grace and pathos. A Mrs. A. H. Leslie tells how as the mountain groaned, ''the earth swayed in deep sympathy.'' Martinique's vicar general begins his account of the eruption, ''This date should be written in blood.'' And an injured sea captain, while being helped from his ship, tells his rescuers, ''I have come from hell.'' In contrast, Zebrowski himself deploys clichéd and hackneyed allusion. Mornings are fateful, cliffs are precipitous and rivers rage. In one passage, Zebrowski calls Mount Pelée's expulsion of molten rock ''upchucking.'' Exclamation points fall upon the page like, well, scoriae. Nonetheless, as a geophysical horror story the book works well and presents a detailed, chilling portrait of one really awful moment in paradise. Erik Larson, the author of ''Isaac's Storm,'' is at work on a book about serial murder and architecture in Gilded Age Chicago."
"Lava works in mysterious ways. Consider, for example, what happened tens of millions of years ago in what is now County Antrim on the north coast of Northern Ireland. Basaltic lava flowed up through cracks in the limestone under the area, creating a plateau. As the lava cooled, it formed remarkably regular and parallel columns, mostly five-, six- and seven-sided, up to 12 feet thick and up to 40 feet high. Yesterday's volcanic activity is today's tourist attraction, and the Giant's Causeway, as the formation of roughly 40,000 basalt columns is known, draws thousands of visitors a year to the small coastal village of Portballintrae. (They learn, among other things, that the formation was the work of the mythical giant Finn McCool, who fell in love with a lady giant in the Hebrides and built it to bring her to Ireland.) Geologists have long known that the columns were formed by the contraction of the hot rock as it cooled and that the same effect can be seen in formations like the Palisades along the Hudson and Devil's Postpile in California. But the precise mechanism that transforms a chaotic mass of cooling rock into regular polygonal columns has not been well understood. Now, two theoretical physicists have devised a model that helps unlock the lava's mysteries. The fractures, they say, begin at the top and spread slowly downward in shallow layers, as each layer is stressed in turn by the cooling and contraction. The pattern of cracks is random at first but becomes more ordered as the cracks propagate, layer to layer, toward a hexagonal configuration that relieves the most stress and reaches a point of minimum energy. ''If you want to fracture a material with the least energy, hexagons are the way to do it,'' said one of the physicists, Alberto G. Rojo of the University of Michigan, co-author with Eduardo A. Jagla in Argentina of a paper about the model in the journal Physical Review E. ''The crack pattern will explore the multidimensional landscape of energy and move toward the configuration of lower energy,'' Dr. Rojo said. It never quite reaches the perfect minimum, he said, because it gets ''trapped'' in other configurations of slightly higher energy that are stable. Dr. Rojo likened it to getting stuck in a valley between two hills. So the Giant's Causeway columns, he said, are not all hexagonal, but rather a mix of polygons. And the more irregular part of the lava above the columns has long since disappeared -- eroded, or, more likely in this case, scraped off by glaciers. Dr. Rojo and Dr. Jagla have long been interested in patterns in nature and the physics of minimal surfaces -- why, for example, soap bubbles take the shapes they do. It was during a discussion of two-dimensional soap films that Dr. Jagla brought in a photograph of a columnar lava formation in Argentina. ''It's not as dramatic as the one in Northern Ireland,'' Dr. Rojo said. ''But we found it very interesting. ''So we started throwing around ideas,'' he added. ''We're used to doing numerical simulations, so we thought, Why don't we play with this model?'' They also ''played'' with cornstarch, to show their model applied not only to huge formations of cooling lava, but to drying cornstarch, though on a much smaller scale. They devised a simple experiment (easily done at home; see photos) that shows the effect in cornstarch, where the polygons, rather than being a meter or more wide, are roughly three orders of magnitude smaller. While conducting their cornstarch experiments Dr. Rojo and Dr. Jagla became aware of similar work by Gerhard Müller, a professor at the University of Frankfurt. Dr. Müller, a seismologist, had long had a side interest in lava columns and had tried to find an experiment to help him understand why they formed. Cornstarch turned out to be ideal. ''It's completely parallel,'' he said. ''In basalt, the contraction is due to cooling; in cornstarch it's due to evaporation.'' But a detailed understanding of why the ordering took place was beyond him. He left that to the physicists. ''They really explained the development of polygonal structure,'' he said. ''I could only explain it in simple words.''"
"Sperm With Team Spirit Bicycle racers, like the 180 or so professional riders now pedaling toward Paris in the Tour de France, know that there is speed in numbers. A group of racers, organized one after the other like a streamlined train, can always travel faster than one going it alone. That is why solo breakaways, when one rider tries to race clear of the pack, are almost never successful. The sperm of the common wood mouse seem to have learned the same lesson. Scientists from England, the Czech Republic and Australia report in the journal Nature that these sperm display a remarkable degree of cooperation in their race toward an egg, forming trains of hundreds or even thousands of cells that enable them to go much faster than single cells. Normally, fertilization is an every-sperm-for-itself thing. In the wood mouse, however, as with other species, females mate frequently with multiple partners, so there may be some benefit to cooperation among the sperm from a single mouse, if this gives it a chance to beat its rivals. This, the researchers say, is apparently the case. A wood mouse sperm has a hooklike appendage on its head that can intertwine with a neighbor's hook, or grab hold of its tail (the flagellum). In this way sperm can form long chains, and the researchers found that chains were much more motile than single sperm, traveling about twice as fast. Of course, a thousand sperm cannot all fertilize the egg. So near the end of the journey, many of the sperm commit a sort of suicide, undergoing an enzymatic reaction that breaks up the train but also makes fertilization impossible. At least one healthy sperm must remain, however, to win the prize. A Big-Appetite Trick Snakes that eat by swallowing their prey whole have to choose their victims carefully. Their jaws open extra wide, sure, but there is a limit to how big a creature will fit down their throats. Some snakes, apparently, have figured out a way to eat something that is bigger than their gape. Gerard's water snake, a small species found in mangrove swamps in Singapore and other parts of Asia, dines exclusively on freshly molted crabs, many of which are too big for the snake to get its jaws around. Instead, according to researchers from the University of Cincinnati, the Field Museum in Chicago and the National University of Singapore, it rips them apart. This is a pretty neat trick for an animal with no arms and teeth that are made for cutting. The snake, the scientists report in Nature, takes the crab in its mouth, forms a loop with its body and sticks its head (plus the crab) through it. The loop holds the crab while the snake pulls on it with its mouth -- playing a game of tug-of-war with itself, essentially, with the crab as the rope. The rope loses. The resulting pieces are small enough to be swallowed. Volcanic Secrets Sometimes you have to get far away from a subject to see it more clearly. That's the case, apparently, with some volcanoes. Seismologists at the California Institute of Technology, using eight years of remote-sensing radar data from two European satellites, have discovered four active volcanoes in the central Andes. The scientists report in Nature that their data covered about 900 of the region's roughly 1,100 known volcanoes, about 50 of which have been considered potentially active. They found surface deformations at four sites that had been thought to be dormant. Such deformation -- swelling or deflating -- means that there is hot magma somewhere below. While the researchers say that none of the four are in imminent danger of erupting, they suggest that the sites should be more closely monitored and assessed for potential hazards like mudflows. One of the volcanoes, Hualca Hualca in southern Peru, is near a city of 20,000 people. Observatory"
"Long-Distance Swimmer On Nov. 23, 2000, a commercial fishing boat off the coast of Greenland got a surprise when it hauled in its nets from a depth of about 4,000 feet. Among the usual harvest of halibut was an odd-looking fish, about 6 feet long and weighing 150 pounds. Having never seen such a specimen before, the captain ordered it frozen, thinking some scientist might like to take a look. Experts from Norway and Denmark have done just that, and they have come to the remarkable conclusion that the fish is a Patagonian toothfish. That's Patagonian as in Patagonia, in southern South America. The fish, a male, was at least 6,000 miles from home. Toothfish, which restaurant diners know better as Chilean sea bass, have a reputation as long-distance migrators, but the farthest north they had been found was 32 degrees south latitude, off Uruguay. This fish was found at 63 degrees north. The researchers, reporting their finding in Nature, say it is highly unlikely that there is an undiscovered population of toothfish off Greenland, since this is the only one identified in the region in two decades of intensive fishing. Rather, they say, the lone fish must have traveled the distance. It would have had to stay below 1,500 feet all the way to avoid warm water of the tropics. The researchers say their finding adds weight to a theory that some fish are able to migrate across the Equator by traveling deep in cold-water zones. The theory has been widely accepted to explain why some fish are distributed both north and south of the tropics. The Ear-Shattering Sea Fish like the Patagonian toothfish may run deep, but they don't necessarily run in silence. Human underwater activities, particularly geological studies that are a routine part of oil exploration, can be extremely noisy. For a long time, biologists have been concerned about the effect of such noise on marine mammals. Now, a new study has shown that there is reason to be concerned about the effect on fish as well. Dr. Arthur N. Popper of the University of Maryland and colleagues at Curtin University in Perth, Australia, studied the effect of noise from air guns on pink snapper in coastal waters of western Australia. Air guns produce an acoustic shock wave that propagates through rock and is reflected back; the return signal is analyzed for clues to the subsurface structure, including the presence of hydrocarbon deposits. Dr. Popper's team exposed pink snapper to air gun noise at various distances and intensity levels and then dissected the ears of the fish. They found extensive damage to the sensory hair cells that are responsible for hearing. While fish sensory cells can grow back, the researchers found that there wasn't enough regeneration to counteract the damage. The study was reported in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America. The researchers cautioned that they examined only one species and that the fish were held in cages. In the wild, fish could presumably swim away from loud noises, though there is evidence that noise may cause enough disorientation to make it difficult to flee. Turbulent Etna Plumbing The eruption that began in October at Mount Etna in Sicily continues to be one of the most explosive in recent memory. But things could get worse before they get better, according to Italian volcanologists. In a study published online by the journal Science, the scientists say that Etna may be due for a period of frequent and powerful eruptions. Magma is rising in the volcano's plumbing system, they say, causing increased pressure, which in turn leads to more earthquakes and eruptions. Over the past 30 years, the scientists say, eruptions have been followed by seismically quiet periods of up to two years. Since 2001, though, the seismic activity has not died down. Observatory"
"Radiation-Resistant Ring When Humpty Dumpty had his great fall, no doubt bits of him went everywhere. How much better it would have been, then, had he been in an egg carton when he fell. He would still have cracked up, but, being confined in a tight space, the pieces would have stayed close to one another. You-know-who would have had a much easier job putting poor Humpty together again. That, more or less, is the secret behind the success of the world's most radiation-resistant organism, the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans. It owes its resistance to the fact that when radiation breaks apart its DNA the pieces are held close enough together for mending to occur, according to research by scientists from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, and other institutions. D. radiodurans has long been a scientific curiosity because of its ability to withstand a radiation dose of 1.5 million rads, making its resistance 1,500 times as great as that for any other living thing. In their studies, reported in Science, the researchers found that the key to the resistance lies in the unusual ringlike structure of the bacterium's DNA. Radiation breaks up DNA chains, and in most organisms the bits and pieces float off, never to meet up with their neighbors again. With D. radiodurans, however, when the DNA is broken up, the ringlike structure holds the fragments in place. Then, DNA-repair enzymes can re-form the chain in the original order. What Made Kilauea Burp Mauna Loa and Kilauea, Hawaii's two most famous volcanoes, are like two members of a complicated extended family. The two volcanoes are related. The question is how closely. Scientists have always theorized that Mauna Loa and Kilauea, next to each other on the Big Island, have to be at the least connected deep in the earth. The question has been whether they also share elements of a magma plumbing system that is much closer to the surface. New findings from the United States Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory and reported in the journal Nature lend credence to the idea that the two have a shallow relationship, as well as a deep one. Using global position system sensors that continuously monitor ground movement, researchers found that two events on the volcanoes in May were probably related. On Mauna Loa, the G.P.S. sensors discovered that the summit caldera, after a decade of slow contraction, abruptly began expanding, a sign of a buildup of magma pressure. At that time, on May 12, lava began flowing from a new vent on Kilauea. Although Kilauea erupts a lot -- it has been continuously erupting for about 20 years -- testing and analysis showed that the timing of the two events was unlikely to be coincidental. The Geological Survey researchers are not sure what the precise relationship between the two volcanoes is. One possibility, they say, is that a pulse of magma entered the Mauna Loa plumbing and, through an interconnection, increased the pressure in Kilauea's system enough to cause it to ''burp'' through the new vent. Strand Alien Trout The Interior Department has begun releasing water from the Glen Canyon Dam in an effort to protect native fish on the Colorado River. Officials expect the releases, which began on Jan. 1 and will fluctuate daily, to last for three months. The flows are intended to strand and dry out beds of nonnative rainbow and brown trout that are thought to be contributing to the rapid decline of a native species, the humpback chub. The releases are part of a two-part plan to help restore the river. The second part, a larger two-day flood intended to move sediment from a tributary, the Paria River, downstream to restore beaches in the Grand Canyon, will not be done this year because drought reduced the available sediment. Officials expect to create the flood next year. Observatory"
"KRAKATOA The Day the World Exploded: August 23, 1883 By Simon Winchester Illustrated. HarperCollins. 416 pages. $25.95. The acknowledgments section of Simon Winchester's latest book cites an unusually large and far-flung group of helpers, and no wonder: Mr. Winchester's ''Krakatoa'' is a trove of wonderfully arcane information. The author has been able to attach so many tentacles to a single event -- the spectacular and catastrophic eruption of the title volcano -- that there seems to be nowhere he can't go. For instance: how do you get from red-hot lava to stone-washed denim jeans? This is just one of the many heretofore unasked questions that ''Krakatoa'' is able -- and eager -- to answer. In this case, it's all in the pumice: this is the lightweight volcanic rock that rained down from the sky in large chunks after Krakatoa's huge, self-immolating blowout. And it is also used to weather fabric as ''it brushes softly against the cloth, whitening and aging it in a way that finds favor with youngsters.'' This manner of amplifying science or history with odd, figurative footnotes has become extremely popular; just read a full-length book about salt, for example. But since ''The Professor and the Madman'' (1998), about the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary, Mr. Winchester has emerged as the leading practitioner of the method. He incorporates research that ranges far and wide, serving up both real and cocktail-party science. And all the while, in scattering these trails of bread crumbs, he keeps track of his story's central path. The rich and fascinating ''Krakatoa'' confirms his pre-eminence, not only for its inspired choice of subject (the author has vastly more to work with than he did in his preceding book, ''The Map That Changed the World''), but also for its enthralling trivia. Here you will learn that William Syer Bristowe is ''perhaps the most famous figure in the spider world, known for calculating that the weight of insects devoured by British spiders in an average year exceeds the total weight of all British people combined.'' And you will learn that Rattus rattus is the precise terminology for black rat. This time, Mr. Winchester has no trouble demonstrating that the main event warrants such close attention. When he refers to ''what might be called the Krakatoa community,'' he does not mean resident Krakatoans (of whom there were fortunately very few); he means the scholars still sifting over the many complex aftershocks of this 120-year-old apocalypse. Without breaking a sweat, Mr. Winchester leads this account through the history of Krakatoa's pre-1883 activity, the plate tectonics theory that delineates the world's volcano belts, the start of rapid worldwide news dissemination, the political evolution of what is now Indonesia from Dutch colonialism to anti-infidel, militant Islam (an eerily resonant part of this story), and the amazing physical details of an explosion that could be heard 2,968 miles away. The Poughkeepsie firemen who leaped into action three months later at the sight of an unusually bright sky may have been responding to the Krakatoa eruption's aftereffects. Then there is the landscape painter inspired to turn out 533 watercolors of the oddly vibrant 1883 sunsets. In addition to the atmospheric fallout that yielded this effect, the event had widespread consequences for scientific researchers. Here is a book that can explain how the jet stream was first identified for weather forecasters on the same page that notes how the World Series got its name. Of particular interest are the book's final sections about the area's natural history after Krakatoa blew itself into oblivion. Like so many good stories, this one has a sequel: the birth of Anak Krakatoa, the new volcanic island that began to emerge decades later in the same region between the islands of Java and Sumatra. Since this was pure lava at first, Mr. Winchester's theories of how it came to develop dense foliage and diverse wildlife -- and the frustrations of watching this new growth rise and fall again with the whims of the still-active volcano -- address one of the planet's essential mysteries. When last seen in his book's epilogue, the author is making an adventurous pilgrimage to Anak Krakatoa, where he meets a six-foot-long lizard that eats his sandwich. Still, he marvels at finding ''a freeze-frame picture of the future of life itself -- a demonstration of the utterly confident way that the world, however badly it has been wounded, picks itself up, continues to unfold its magic and its marvels, and sets itself back on its endless trail of evolutionary progress yet again.'' Among the minor marvels to be found here is the way swiftlets are farmed for the saliva used in bird's nest soup; the sci-fi sounding continents of Laurasia and Gowandaland, named by the apparent crackpot Alfred Lothar Wegener (who turned out to be right about how the planet looked before continental drift began); the mechanism that creates the shape of raindrops, a find also partly attributed to Wegener; and the discoverer of the undersea transform fault, who ''created paper-and-crayon diagrams of the model, cut them out, and kept them in his wallet, showing them to anyone who would give him the time of day.'' Then there is what may be the world's longest book: a six-million-word history written in Court Javanese. And there is the world's largest flower, named for the British colonizer Thomas Stamford Raffles, ''which has blooms a yard wide, weighs as much as 24 pounds, and has a memorably horrible smell.'' When Mr. Winchester occasionally overreaches for the sake of such details, he packs in stories like the one about the baby circus elephant that went wild, perhaps sensing Krakatoa's imminent eruption before humans could. Maybe this is meaningful and germane. Then again, maybe this elephant just did not like being left alone in a hotel room while his mistress went out to dinner. Like the controversial Immanuel Velikovsky, the honorary godfather of this genre (who could trace almost any event in the Earth's ancient history to rogue behavior of the planet Venus), Mr. Winchester takes his subject everywhere it can possibly go. Inevitably, this leads him to Hollywood's best-loved bit of idiocy: ''Krakatoa, East of Java,'' the 1969 Cinerama debacle that accidentally confused east with west. As delighted as he is by specifics and oddities, Mr. Winchester is someone who will point out that the film's fake-looking little volcano models were made of polystyrene. BOOKS OF THE TIMES"
"KRAKATOA The Day the World Exploded: August 27, 1883. By Simon Winchester. Illustrated. 416 pp. New York: HarperCollins Publishers. $25.95. WHEN a volcano erupts, it can do terrible damage, as Vesuvius did in A.D. 79, burying the cities and inhabitants of Pompeii and Herculaneum. But as the tens of thousands of people now living on its slopes can attest, Vesuvius is still there, and so are most of the world's better-known volcanoes, such as Etna, Rainier, Kilauea, Paricutín and Fujiyama (yes, Fuji is a volcano; it last erupted in 1707). Even Mount St. Helens, the top of which blew off in 1980, is (mostly) still there. It is very rare that an eruption is so great that it destroys the entire mountain; we know of Mount Mazama (which left behind Crater Lake in Oregon), Santorini (which may have taken out the Minoan civilization and left a great hole in the Aegean) and Krakatoa, the subject of Simon Winchester's brilliant new book, which not only blew up the mountain, it blew up the island the mountain sat on. Krakatoa was (past tense) located in the Sunda Strait, between the large islands of Sumatra and Java, and composed of three peaks: Rakata, at 2,600 feet; Danan, at nearly 1,500; and Perboewatan, at 400. The volcano began to signal its intentions with violent earthquakes in May 1883. ''It began with a sudden trembling,'' Winchester writes. ''At first it was slight, more of a quivering of the air, a series of windy rumblings, of vague, barely noticeable atmospheric flutterings.'' After three months of rumbling earth tremors, the island blew up with a succession of blasts that could be heard 3,000 miles away. (If Pikes Peak in Colorado had exploded with the same force, every person in the continental United States would have heard it.) There were four detonations over the course of five hours; the last, occurring at 10:02 a.m. local time at Krakatoa on Monday, Aug. 27, 1883, was one of the biggest explosions in recorded history. Most accounts of volcanic eruptions, including Pliny the Younger's eyewitness account of the eruption of Vesuvius (which killed his uncle, Pliny the Elder), concern themselves with the pyrotechnics of the eruption, the billowing clouds of smoke, molten lava or burning ash rolling down the slopes and, ultimately, the death toll. But Winchester's book is a murder mystery with more than 36,000 victims, and everything in the book -- from the early Dutch settlers, the history of the spice trade in the East Indies, the discovery of the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates and the history of the undersea telegraph -- leads ineluctably to the solution. He tells us not only what happened, where and when; assisted by modern geological theory, he explains why Krakatoa exploded. Many people thought it was the end of the world or the Day of Judgment, but Winchester -- trained as a geologist -- identifies the forces at work within the earth that can (and do) bring about such cataclysms. Although we are still unable to predict when a volcano will erupt, we have managed to acquire at least a partial understanding of the forces that can cause the earth's plates to move, producing the not unrelated seismic phenomena of earthquakes and volcanoes. At Krakatoa, when the earth split asunder, cold seawater contacted the red-hot magma, the steam exploded with catastrophic violence, and six cubic miles of rock and ash were hurled more than 20 miles into the stratosphere. An hour after the explosions, as lightning stroboscopically lit up the blackening skies, a thick, muddy rain fell on Batavia (now Jakarta). Broiling-hot debris from the blast, some chunks three feet around, fell over hundreds of square miles. Since the island was uninhabited at the time, nobody on Krakatoa was killed, but giant tsunamis rolled out in all directions, flooding the coasts of Java and Sumatra, submerging nearly 300 towns and villages and killing more than 36,000 people. It was as if a mountain-size red-hot rock had been dropped into the ocean. (Indeed, some 65 million years ago, a mountain-size asteroid slammed into what would later be known as the Yucatán peninsula, where, many scientists believe, it wreaked such ecological havoc that the nonavian dinosaurs disappeared forever.) A 72-foot-high wave engulfed and totally destroyed the town of Telokbetong at the head of Sumatra's Lampong Bay, killing 2,200 people. Water cascaded into the town of Tangerang, and when it swept out again, it carried people, animals, houses and trees. No one expected the waves to return after they had receded. It is likely that many people believed the worst was over and returned to their shoreside villages, only to experience another, more catastrophic, inundation. The town of Merak, which had suffered little damage from the first wave, was destroyed by the second. The huge wave, after traveling at hundreds of miles per hour, entered the narrow bay, and as the shoaling beach slowed down the leading edge of the wave, millions of gallons of water began piling up behind, until the wave reached the astonishing and totally terrifying height of 135 feet, as tall as a 10-story building. This mountain of seething water rolled over Merak, obliterating everything in its path and drowning all but two of its 2,700 inhabitants. Anjer was drowned by a 33-foot wave, and Tyringin, 24 miles from the volcano, was smashed by a 70-foot-high locomotive of roiling water. It was not the lava, noxious gases, flame, smoke or volcanic bombs that destroyed those unfortunate thousands; it was the terrible power of water. In the vast majority of instances death came at the hands of seismic sea waves. To the accompaniment of thunderous explosions, the wave swept around St. Nicholas Point on Java and headed for Batavia, 94 miles from the epicenter. At approximately 12:15 p.m., two hours after the final explosion, the sea roared into the capital city. It receded, and then came back. Thousands of ships, ranging in size from steamships to small proas, were destroyed in Batavia's harbor. Nine hours after the eruption, many riverboats were swamped and sunk in Calcutta, 2,000 miles away, and ships strained at their anchors at Port Elizabeth, South Africa, 5,000 miles from the blast. What did not remain, Winchester writes, ''was the volcano that had caused it all. . . . Krakatoa, after the final majestic concatenation of seismic and tectonic climaxes that occurred just after 10 on the Monday morning, had simply and finally exploded itself out of existence.'' Where once there had been a tropical peak that was 2,600 feet tall, there was now a hole in the ocean floor that was 1,000 feet deep. Krakatoa's explosion generated a climate-altering ash cloud that produced lurid red, blue, green and copper-colored sunsets, and lowered temperatures around the world. In 1815, the eruption of the volcano Tambora, on the Indonesian island of Sumbawa, caused the ''year without summer'' in 1816, when so much ash was carried into the upper atmosphere that it blocked the sun; it snowed in Boston in June and a famine spread across parts of Europe. The parallels between today's ''weapons of mass destruction'' and the destructive power of volcanoes are painfully obvious -- both can kill thousands of innocent people -- but Winchester identifies an unforeseen repercussion of the 1883 eruption: the willingness of the Javanese to blame the gods for the destruction of their islands and villages opened the door to Islamic militants, who rapidly gained the hearts and minds of the people, making modern Indonesia the largest Muslim country in the world. Like its subject, Winchester's book is rife with superlatives. Here is his description of the giant wave that drowned Merak: ''This too was Krakatoa's most colossal wave, the biggest consequence of the biggest and final explosion. It was a wave so enormous and so powerful that it turned out to be the grimmest of grim reapers, the terrible climax to a long and deadly day.'' Krakatoa (the volcano) wasn't the largest or deadliest of recent Indonesian volcanic eruptions. That dubious distinction goes to Tambora, which erupted with more than twice the power of Krakatoa, killed 10,000 people outright and caused the death of another 82,000 by starvation and disease. ''Krakatoa'' (the book) is, also like its subject, deserving of superlatives: It is thrilling, comprehensive, literate, meticulously researched and scientifically accurate; it is one of the best books ever written about the history and significance of a natural disaster. Richard Ellis is the author of ''Imagining Atlantis'' and ''Aquagenesis: The Origin and Evolution of Life in the Sea.''"
"The rolling pine forests, snowcapped mountains and crisp fall evenings here tend to make people forget the fact that the park sits atop a huge simmering underground volcano. But new geologic events have served up reminders. In a few days in July, acidic ground water dissolved parts of the unpaved trails in the Norris Geyser Basin, and the ground temperature of the trails shot up to 200 degrees from the usual maximum of 80. Park officials closed nearly half of the basin's trails, and they remain shut. On Aug. 21, a magnitude 4.4 earthquake shook the southern boundary of the park and startled residents. Yellowstone is one of the most seismically active places on the planet, with hundreds of shakes and shimmers throughout the year. They reach magnitude 4 usually only every other year. In the park, such events are no great surprise. ''Change is what we expect in Yellowstone,'' said the park geologist, Hank Heasler. Although there is no indication that any of the changes suggest an impending eruption, even that would not be so surprising. Over last 630,000 years, Yellowstone has experienced 29 eruptions the size of the one on Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991. The average interval here has been 20,000 years, and 70,000 have passed since its last eruption. But the volcano, with a caldera 45 by 28 miles, has the potential for far more catastrophic explosions. The last major eruption, estimated at a magnitude 1,000 times as great as the Mount St. Helens explosion of 1980, was 627,000 years ago. The ancient blast blew up miles of mountain range, and ash from it has been uncovered in 22 Western states. It was so thick 1,000 miles away in Kansas that it was mined in the 1930's and used to make a cleanser. Whether the caldera erupts or not, the stew of partly molten rock 5 to 10 miles below the park exerts a powerful and constant influence. ''The whole of the Yellowstone Plateau is going up and down from the magma,'' averaging one and a half centimeters a year, said Dr. Robert B. Smith, a professor of geophysics at the University of Utah and a member of the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. ''It's like a living, breathing thing.'' In light of the new activity, safety is a growing concern, and officials are writing a hazard plan in case the region grows more active. The ground warming could mean that heat is increasing water pressure, a possible cause of eruptions. In 1989, Porkchop Geyser in Norris Basin became clogged with silica. It exploded and created a 12-foot-wide crater now called Porkchop Hot Spring. A hydrothermal explosion at Mary Bay in Yellowstone Lake some 13,000 years ago blew out a crater more than three miles across. Serious earthquakes are always a possibility. Even though the temblor on Aug. 21 caused no damage, it was widely felt. The largest quake recorded in the West, 7.5 on the old Richter scale, was centered just outside the park in 1959. It dislodged a huge slice of a mountain west of the park, buried 25 campers as they slept in a national forest campground and dammed the Madison River to create Quake Lake. One question that occupies geologists is how the caldera affects fault lines and vice versa. Five major faults terminate in the molten caldera, and even far-flung events can shake the earth here. In November 2002, a magnitude 7.9 quake in Denali National Park in Alaska rippled through the region, leading to more than 500 other quakes that Dr. Smith watched simultaneously on a computer in Utah. ''The whole of Yellowstone lit up like a Christmas tree,'' he said. ''It was exciting. I had a ranger call me and say, 'I've called you before about earthquakes, but these are coming at us from all directions.' '' Except for the quake two months ago, Yellowstone has had far fewer quakes in recent years. ''Seismically, its been deathly quiet,'' Dr. Smith said. ''We average a half-dozen to 20 quakes'' a day. ''The last two years, we see a couple a day.'' The energy of the quakes has been harnessed to shed light on the volcano. A measuring method, seismic tomography, which is similar to C.T. scanning, uses the shock waves that the quakes generate to map structures deep in the earth. Figures from 12,000 quakes gave Dr. Smith a picture of the size and shape of the magma chamber. The magma also fuels geothermal features. All the geyser basins are similar, in that they sit over porous channelized rock layers that contain water under pressure. The water seeps toward the magma zone, where it is superheated. As the water is forced back toward the surface, the pressure is relieved and volume expands, causing geysers to erupt. Even among the steaming, hissing and bubbling landscapes here, Norris Basin stands out. Steamboat Geyser is the tallest one in the park, at 380 feet, more than twice as high as Old Faithful. Test drilling in 1929 measured water temperatures 265 feet down at 400 degrees, and drilling equipment had to be withdrawn. ''The geothermal features of Norris are equally amazing to scientists who have been here for 30 years or someone on their first visit,'' said Mr. Heasler, the geologist. Each year, a disturbance at Norris alters features and muddies the water. This year, the disturbance, on July 11, was more severe than usual. Because the ''plumbing'' is underground, the more precise mechanics of geyser basins are not well understood, and why Norris Basin has changed so markedly and suddenly is guesswork. ''The most common hypothesis is that snowmelt wanes and the water table lowers and weight on the system decreases and, as a result, the water boils more aggressively,'' said Dr. Jake Lowenstern, a geologist at the United States Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., who is in charge of the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. Many features took longer than usual to return to base line, although some have not returned. Echinus Geyser once erupted frequently, every 35 to 75 minutes. In 1998 it switched to an irregular pattern. It had been erupting every two to nine hours before this season's disturbance, which somehow made it blow on a schedule again, every 3 hours 30 minutes to 3 hours 40 minutes. The geyser has now reverted to irregularity. Pearl Geyser, an erupting pool named for its opalescent blue color, usually has two-meter eruptions. After the disturbance, it changed color to crystal clear, then became a steam vent and later returned to an opalescent pool with one-meter eruptions. At the northern end of the basin, a series of vents, or fumaroles, appeared and mud pots cropped up on the trail, splattering hot acidic mud, though it later disappeared. ''Norris,'' Mr. Heasler said, ''is showing us something, and whether we can figure it out, we'll see.''"
"Tucked away in a four-foot-high, blue steel box in the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, a few steps from the tourists milling among the hot dog stands outside, is a 2,000-degree speck of magma -- molten rock, held under terrific pressure -- from the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in Roman times. Yes, this is the stuff that exploded and rained down on Pompeii in A.D. 79. Dr. James Webster, geologist, and his associates gathered pumice from the slopes of Vesuvius, and now he is cooking and squeezing the material to the same temperatures and pressures it had in the seething belly of the volcano before the eruption. And like some diabolical brewmaster, he has spiked the mixture with the one original ingredient the pumice was lacking: the volatile gases that had been dissolved in the Vesuvian magma, the gases whose explosive release threw ash into the stratosphere and sent deadly clouds called pyroclastic flows racing down the slopes of the volcano. Dr. Webster is, in effect, putting the fizz back into flat Champagne. His experiment poses no threat since the piece of magma is far too tiny. Still, the juxtaposition with the oblivious people outside is thought-provoking: some half a billion people worldwide live within 60 miles of historically active volcanoes, according to the Cascade Volcano Observatory of the United States Geological Survey. Around the slopes of Vesuvius alone, which erupted as recently as 1944, 2.5 million people are living in what is now Naples -- one reason that Dr. Webster's closest collaborator on the work is Dr. Benedetto De Vivo of the University of Naples. This little chemistry experiment is part of a worldwide effort to understand what makes volcanoes -- darkly famous names like Mount St. Helens and Pinatubo and Krakatau and Vesuvius -- go bang. Other researchers are studying the dynamics of the hot, pressurized bubbles that form in the magma before it erupts, much like shaken seltzer, soda or Champagne. Others are analyzing the ominous seismic signals, called long-period oscillations, that ring out from the frothy magma as it moves inside the beast. ''All of those things mean that the last few years we're really making big advances in understanding how the system behaves,'' said Dr. Steve Sparks, a professor of geology at Bristol University in England, ''and the key to all of this is linking the observations to the models.'' Many people picture a volcano's innards as a vertical tube like a straw drawing magma from a balloonlike well of magma, which obligingly burbles out through a crater. The geologists' new work reveals frothy, viscous masses that crack and groan as they rise through irregular fissures. The chemistry and dynamics are so complex that the same magma, in the same volcano, can either create a tremendous explosion or ooze forth sedately -- called an ''effusive'' eruption -- depending on slight differences in how fast the magma rises. ''We all cringe when we see the balloon and straw because that's everybody's view of a volcano,'' said Dr. Steve McNutt, research professor of volcano seismology at the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska. ''We think it's quite a bit more complicated than that.'' Volcanologists are not ready to say that theirs has become a predictive science, like meteorology. But the new science of volcanoes has taken great strides, the scientists say. They cite the subtle seismic blips called tornillos that were picked up from Galeras, a volcano in Colombia, before it erupted and killed nine members of a research party at the summit in 1993. ''Ten years on from Galeras we know an enormous amount more about those tornillos and L.P. events,'' Dr. Sparks said, referring to long-period, or low-pitched, rumbles characteristic of active volcanoes. ''If there was another event like Galeras, it's hard to imagine that in similar circumstances the scientists would be killed.'' Standing next to a tall beige cabinet filled with drawers of mineral samples at the museum, Dr. Charles Mandeville, a volcanologist there, holds two large rocks. The one in his left hand is heavy, jagged and charcoal-colored, pitted with tiny round holes. In his right is a pale gray, friable, bloblike object of about the same size that feels light enough to float on water. The rocks are at the center of a volcanological version of the nature-nurture debate. ''These two samples have identical chemistry,'' Dr. Mandeville said; they are the geologic equivalent of identical twins. And the pieces were drawn from the same magma supply and ejected from the same volcano, Mount Mazama, which exploded and formed Crater Lake in Oregon some 7,600 years ago. The dark, denser sample, he said, emerged in an effusive event that preceded the cataclysmic eruption by a few weeks or months. Like sociologists looking for environmental factors to explain criminal behavior, volcanologists around the world want to understand those striking differences. The scientists start with a general grasp of how explosive volcanoes form. They are most common around the ''Ring of Fire,'' which follows the Pacific coastline from the western limn of South America, Mexico, the United States and Canada, across the Aleutian Islands and down eastern Russia through Japan, Indonesia and New Zealand. In those places, the ocean crust, laden with water, is slowly diving beneath the much thicker crust of the continents in a process called subduction. The ocean crust heats and releases its water, which diffuses upward and soaks into the earth's hot mantle. Because water alters the chemical structure of the mantle rock and causes its melting point to fall, parts of the rock melt and, like enormous hot-air balloons in slow motion, rise through fissures in the mantle. As the magma rises, the confining pressure on it drops and the water in it begins to form bubbles. So many bubbles form that they can occupy as much as 90 percent of the volume of the magma as it moves toward the top of a volcano, said Dr. Donald Dingwell, the director of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Munich. And when the volcano erupts, he added, ''the basic explosive energy is coming from the high-pressure gas in the bubbles.'' Although volcanologists now agree with that general picture, it leaves open the crucial question of why some eruptions are explosive and others -- often in the same volcano, as with Mount Mazama -- merely effusive, spitting up magma like overheated oatmeal on a stovetop. The experiments in Dr. Webster's pressure cooker on Central Park West are designed to look at one side of that multifaceted mystery. The magma from Vesuvius, an explosive volcano outside the Ring of Fire, lost its water when the bubbles burst during the Pompeii eruption. But before he seals fragments of the pumice inside a small gold capsule and places it in the cooker, he includes a source of water. The magma soaks it up, and he cools the sample carefully so that none is released. Then he and Dr. Mandeville place the sample in a microscope outfitted with an instrument called a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, which can measure the water hidden in the structure of the rock. The results show how much water the magma soaked up at various pressures, corresponding to various depths in the earth. Because water is not the only volatile substance the magma can soak up -- sulfur, chlorine and carbon dioxide are others -- Dr. Webster repeats his experiments with different combinations of the chemicals locked in the capsule with the magma. The results show, in fact, that only trace amounts of the additional chemicals can make it much harder for the water to stay dissolved in the magma as it rises. The implication is that the potentially explosive bubbles may begin to form much farther down in the crust than previously thought, deeper than 10 miles, and play an important role in determining the type of eruption much earlier in the process. ''There's growing evidence that these gases start to come out of solution at much greater depth than had been believed,'' said Dr. Paul Wallace, a volcanologist at the University of Oregon. Out on the slopes of the volcanoes, Dr. Wallace and Dr. Webster also collect small bits of glass that form in the magma as it rises and cools, trapping the volatile gases like flies in amber. The results add weight to the significance of the bubbles and the gases within them. The significance of findings like those may be illuminated by theoretical and experimental work by Dr. Dingwell, in Munich, and his colleagues. He pointed out that as the water outgasses and forms bubbles, the magma itself becomes drastically more viscous, or syrupy. A drop by a factor of 10 in the amount of water in the magma can cause its viscosity to soar by a factor of a million, Dr. Dingwell said. The magma can become so viscous that it acts like a solid, plugging its conduit and causing terrific pressure to build. The bubbles also have a hard time expanding and dissipating in the syrupy mass, meaning that they stay inside the molten rock like bits of dynamite waiting to explode. If the magma rises slowly enough, the bubbles, like air in honey, do have time to expand, coalesce and leak away through fissures in the earth. A little faster, perhaps because the subterranean forces are slightly greater, and the trapped energy remains inside the magma, now as rigid as glass. ''The magma can become embrittled by losing gas,'' said Dr. Sparks of Bristol University, ''and this leads to conditions whereby the thing can explode.'' Additional gases rising from fresh magma below can also make the system more unstable and prone to a huge eruption. The brittleness of the magma may help explain why the seismic jolts called long-period oscillations are indicators of an eruption, said Dr. Bernard Chouet, a geophysicist at the Geological Survey. The magma can crack as it flows, releasing gases that set off resonances -- the oscillations -- within cavities and cracklike conduits in the mountain. Then, because it is ultimately a liquid, the cracks can close up before the magma ruptures again, producing an insistent signal of disaster. That picture is far from theoretical, as Dr. Chouet used repetitive signals -- then not nearly as well understood -- to help predict the imminent eruption of Mount Redoubt, an Alaskan volcano, in December 1989. It continued to erupt in 1990. ''It's a succession of fracture and healing, fracture and healing,'' Dr. Chouet said. As subtle as the signal and the physics behind it are, the potential outcome, he said, is anything but: ''It blows the top to smithereens.''"
"Margarita Saldarriaga, Arboletes, Colombia, June 22, 2003 Saldarriaga (center): ''Arboletes is a very simple town, very poor. Its attraction is the volcano. I've never heard of it erupting; it is a tourist spot. They say bathing in the volcano's mud cures arthritis pain and asthma and that it's good for the skin. Along the banks, the mud is drier, so to get all muddy, you have to go to the center. Some people dive in as if it were a pool. You feel like you should sink. But you just stay up. It's a strange feeling. It is difficult to get out because the mud is heavy. You have to slide like a snake. You go wash in the sea, and then you feel like new. I wanted to show Arboletes to my friend Steve, who is visiting from America. I'm from Medellín, about eight hours away by bus. There was an army presence for the entire trip. Steve was shocked, but I'm used to it. I never stopped taking trips in Colombia because of fear. I've been in places that are considered 100 percent guerrilla zones. I would tell his family or anyone from the States not to worry, just come. If it's your turn to die, it'll happen wherever you are.'' interview by Silvana Paternostro THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 7-20-03"
"Deep beneath the ice-sheathed Arctic Ocean, a 1,000-mile seam in the earth's rocky crust, long thought to be largely dormant, has been revealed as a simmering necklace of volcanoes and hot-water vents that may harbor unique life forms. Earlier surveys in the depths near the North Pole had identified a couple of seabed volcanoes in one place along the seam, which is called the Gakkel Ridge and bisects the polar ocean from Greenland to Siberia. But sonar and seismic readings, rock samples and water measurements gathered during a recent joint expedition by German and American ice-breaking ships have created a detailed overview of the surprisingly dynamic geology of the ridge. Researchers and experts not directly involved in the new work said the findings challenged longstanding notions about such midocean ridges, which are the geologic factories forging earth's ever-changing crust. The charts and two accompanying papers appear in the current issue of the journal Nature and greatly elaborate on initial descriptions of the Arctic seafloor vents published in the same journal in January. The Gakkel is the least active of the midocean ridges found throughout the world's seas. These are the gutter-shaped valley and mountain systems where the crust of the seafloor spreads out to each side and hot magma pushes to the surface. Earlier surveys measuring the magnetic signature of rocks in the Gakkel ridge found that it generally spreads only a quarter-inch or so a year in each direction, about a seventh or less of the spreading rate seen in most midocean ridges. The slow spreading rate was presumed until now to inhibit the surge of magma, the researchers and other experts said. The likelihood of finding volcanoes and life-sustaining vents was so low that the 30-member team that put to sea in the summer of 2001 on the two ships included just one vent specialist, said that expert, Dr. Henrietta N. Edmonds, a geochemist from the University of Texas. ''I was brought along as a funky add-on,'' she said. ''They were saying, 'Man, she's going to be bored for a couple of months.' '' That was before the results started pouring in from her instruments, which were attached to cables as they lowered rock-sampling dredges and checked for rising temperatures and turbidity -- hints of any upstream plume of mineral-rich, volcanically heated water gushing from the seabed into the frigid sea. The researchers said they were shocked when more than 80 percent of the instrument deployments detected such emissions over the 600-mile portion of the ridge that was surveyed. ''We were expecting it to be practically dead,'' said Dr. Peter J. Michael, the lead author of one of the new Nature papers and a geologist at the University of Tulsa. ''Instead we got so many readings that we thought the equipment was not working right.'' By chance, that summer the polar ice pack was exceptionally thin and widely dispersed, so the ships -- the American Coast Guard vessel Healy and the German Polarstern -- were able to collect far more data than had been expected. Until this expedition, the only surveys of the ridge had been done sporadically by Navy submarines that, while submerged, cannot maintain precise coordinates on their positions. ''I think we know the topography of Mars and the Moon better than that area of the Arctic,'' said Dr. Wilfried Jokat, a lead author of one of the Nature papers and a senior scientist at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar Research in Bremerhaven, Germany. Some of the volcanic domes that the survey detected rise more than a mile from the three-mile-deep bottom of the rift valley running down the center of the Gakkel Ridge. The hot spots found along the ridge appear to have existed fairly consistently for up to 25 million years in some cases, according to the papers. It may be that the composition of the underlying rock, or other factors besides the rate at which the seafloor is spreading, determine whether there is volcanic activity or the kind of cracking and heat that can result in hydrothermal vents, Dr. Michael said. The findings also raise the tantalizing prospect that the vents nourish novel ecosystems in the Arctic, Dr. Edmonds and other marine scientists said. The Gakkel's hydrothermal vents, which spew torrents of water heated by magma welling from the planet's fiery depths, are similar to others found elsewhere in the world's oceans, most of them nourishing specialized ecosystems. But because the Arctic Ocean is connected to the Pacific and Atlantic by relatively shallow passages, it is possible that vents there -- isolated for millions of years -- might support species not seen anywhere else, the scientists said. One of the deepest connections is the strait running from the Arctic Ocean past Greenland to the North Atlantic, Dr. Edmonds said. But even there, she said, submerged ridges and Iceland act ''like a wall between the Gakkel Ridge and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge,'' where vent communities have been seen. The next challenge will be to explore the Arctic vents up close, Dr. Edmonds said. It is one thing to drop dredges and sensors into the Arctic off the stern of a great bluff-nosed icebreaker. It is another thing to consider doing the same thing with a submarine or even a costly unpiloted robotic vehicle. The grinding sea ice has been known to shear through heavy connecting cables. Oceanographers are developing several new submersibles that by 2005 or 2006 might be able to do the job, Dr. Edmonds said."
"Scientists who support a controversial theory that a meteor crash coincided with the largest mass extinction in earth's history now assert that they have narrowed the location of the impact -- somewhere on land in the tropics. The extinction occurred 250 million years ago at the boundary between the Permian and Triassic geological periods, and killed 90 percent of the living species. Scientists generally agree that the most recent, and perhaps most well-known mass extinction, which killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, was caused when a meteor struck earth near the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. They disagree on the causes of earlier extinctions. Evidence at the Permian-Triassic extinction is sketchier, but most scientists theorize that the most likely cause was a series of giant volcanic eruptions in Siberia that spewed 600,000 cubic miles of lava and might have induced catastrophic ecological changes. Last month, a team of scientists headed by Dr. Asish R. Basu, a professor of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Rochester, reported in the journal Science that it had found shards of the meteorite in rocks from Antarctica. Other researchers agreed that the fragments looked extraterrestrial, but questioned whether they were as old as claimed. On Friday, at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union here, the same group of scientists reported finding tiny glass spheres about one-thousandth of an inch in diameter in the same layer of rock in Antarctica. The spheres, the scientists said, are pieces of the earth's crust melted by the meteor impact and then cooled into spheres. Such spheres can also form in volcanic eruptions. But the composition of glass does not resemble lava. Instead, the spheres contain a mix of elements typical of old continental soil in the tropics, low in sodium, calcium and magnesium, which are washed away by heavy rains, and relatively high in metals like titanium, aluminum, silicon and iron, which are left behind. ''This seems to really convince people,'' said Dr. Stein B. Jacobsen, a professor of geochemistry at Harvard and a member of the research team. ''There are no volcanic rocks of that composition.'' No crater corresponding to the extinction has been located. But, Dr. Jacobsen said, ''this gives us a clue where we should look.'' If scientists become convinced of the meteor evidence, that would reopen the debate on whether meteors can not only cause extinctions, but also set off huge volcanic eruptions thousands of miles away, because the Siberian eruptions coincide exactly with the Permian-Triassic extinction. The dinosaur extinction 65 million years ago coincided with similarly extensive eruptions in India. Each type of event is rare, and two coincidences strike some scientists as highly unlikely. But many scientists have been skeptical about that idea, because most calculations indicate that an impact would not be powerful enough to crack the crust, and the Indian eruptions started before the Yucatán meteor hit."
"SO, the blood-red sky in ''The Scream'' might not have been a pigment of Edvard Munch's imagination after all. Three researchers report in the February issue of Sky & Telescope that it would have been the color Munch saw as he took a sunset stroll along the Ljabrochausseen road (now Mosseveien) in the port city of Christiania (now Oslo) in late 1883 or early 1884. At that time the detritus from the eruption of the Indonesian volcano Krakatoa, on Aug. 27, 1883, had just reached Norway. It happens once in a while that academic sleuths, usually moonlighting from the research and lecturing they do at their day jobs, uncover the literal explanation for a previously mysterious artistic effect. Like many people, they're drawn to a work of art for reasons they can't articulate. But at some point they realize that they have the means to do with these artistic enigmas what the rest of us can't: provide scientific solutions; articulate their reasons. Monet's water lilies? He had cataracts. Even the mother of all artistic enigmas, the ''Mona Lisa'' smile, has an explanation. Margaret Livingstone, a neurophysiologist at the Harvard Medical School and the author of ''Vision and Art: The Biology of Seeing,'' made worldwide headlines three years ago when she announced that the muscles around the mouth in the painting suggest a smile only when we don't look directly at them -- which is partly why the smile seems so fleeting and (heretofore) mysterious. The three Texas State University scholars who traced ''The Scream'' to its origins -- Don Olson and Russell Doescher (physics) and Mr. Olson's wife, Marilynn Olson (English) -- have made a cottage industry out of such investigations into works of art, especially relating to astronomy. Last year, they determined that a van Gogh that art historians had titled ''Sunset'' was in fact a ''Moonrise'' -- and a moonrise over Saint-Rémy-de-Provence on July 13, 1889, at 9:08 p.m. local time, to be exact. Three years ago, Mr. Olson and Mr. Doescher examined van Gogh's ''White House at Night,'' not only identifying the bright object in the sky as Venus but locating the real white house in Auvers -- previously a matter of contention even among residents. ''We have gone from knowing almost nothing about this beautiful painting,'' Mr. Olson said at the time, ''to knowing almost everything there is to know about it.'' Well, that depends on your definition of ''almost.'' Mr. Olson was referring to the literal facts behind the painting, and it might be tempting to respond that such literalism does art an injustice -- that reducing the emotional depths of the red in ''The Scream'' to an atmospheric anomaly robs it of its mystique. And maybe, to some extent, it does. But to a greater extent, it doesn't. Such literalism can actually add to an artwork's mystique. By helping us identify the part of art that's not a mystery, these efforts help us focus more narrowly on the part that is. Consider Munch. He wasn't alone in seeing that sky. Contemporary newspaper and scientific accounts make clear, as the Sky & Telescope article says, that due to the fallout from Krakatoa the ''end of 1883 and the first months of 1884 had the most spectacular twilights of the last 150 years.'' Of the scene in New York, The New York Times of Nov. 28, 1883, reported: ''Soon after 5 o'clock the western horizon suddenly flamed into a brilliant scarlet, which crimsoned sky and clouds. People in the streets were startled at the unwonted sight and gathered in little groups on all the corners to gaze into the west. Many thought that a great fire was in progress.'' Two days later, Munch's hometown paper carried this account: ''A strong light was seen yesterday and today around 5 o'clock to the west of the city. People believed it was a fire: but it was actually a red refraction in the hazy atmosphere after sunset.'' Munch wasn't even alone on his twilight perambulation around Christiania. He wrote in his journal: ''I was walking along the road with two friends -- then the Sun set -- all at once the sky became blood red -- and I felt overcome with melancholy. I stood still and leaned against the railing, dead tired -- clouds like blood and tongues of fire hung above the blue-black fjord and the city.'' Where Munch was alone, though, was in his response. ''My friends went on,'' the journal entry continues, ''and I stood alone, trembling with anxiety. I felt a great, unending scream piercing through nature.'' That's mystery No. 1: why him? Of the three friends walking along the Ljabrochausseen, of the hundreds or thousands strolling the streets of Christiania at that hour, of the millions who must have witnessed similar sunsets around the world during those months, why did one Edvard Munch see in the sky the sound of a scream? What was it about this sight that would haunt him in particular for the better part of a decade? A friend wrote about discussing art with Munch in the winter of 1891-92: ''For a long time he had wanted to paint the memory of a sunset. Red as blood. No, it was coagulated blood. But no one else would perceive it the same way he did. They would think only about clouds.'' In 1893, Munch succeeded in capturing not only the coloring of the sky on that unforgettable (for him) evening, but the emotion accompanying it. And he succeeded in a way the sky itself did not. It's his sky that has become iconic, immortal. It's his individual emotional response that the two friends who kept walking along a road in Christiania, or the masses who went back to their business in Manhattan, presumably didn't feel -- but, judging from the response of generations to come, would have felt if only they'd seen his red instead. And that's mystery No. 2. The answers to the other questions -- why the sky was red, what planet rose over what house, how Leonardo got that effect -- satisfy our curiosity about the literal truth. Maybe they even satisfy some desire to demystify art. But they also serve a subtler, perhaps equally unconscious, purpose. They enhance the questions we can't answer, the twin mysteries that arise out of the individual response of one artist in one place and the universal response of all audiences everywhere: Why the ''Mona Lisa'' smile to begin with? And why will we continue to seek it forever -- even when we know its not there?

"They sit for hours, gazing across a mud-caked valley toward the rumbling mountain. Over the last week, since Mount St. Helens reawakened after almost two decades with a huge plume of steam, thousands have come here from across the West Coast and as far away as Texas. They sleep in nearby hotels or up here in cars, camper-vans and mobile homes and in sleeping bags laid across the rocky soil -- all waiting for the earth to reveal its intentions. They have motored up to this mountain carting digital cameras, barbecue grills, coolers, wine, romance novels, telescopes, all in a sort of pilgrimage to the place where, they say, the earth feels more alive -- and so do they. ''At our age we're racing the clock,'' said Gayle Boren, 66, of Midlothian, Tex., who flew here to southwest Washington with her friend Opal French, 75, of Lubbock, Tex. ''We're trying to do and see as much as we can before we die.'' Like so many others up here who seem content to pass entire days staring at the mostly quiet mountain -- as active as it looks on television, it really only erupts once in a while, and then for at most an hour at a time -- the pair said they had come in search of a feeling. They sat together on canvas chairs borrowed from a young couple nearby, under the shade of an alder tree near the Castle Lake Viewpoint, about eight miles from the mountain's crater. They explained the feeling they were after: a thrill that was as much about waiting for a volcano to erupt as it was about the sense of escape. ''It's something we can enjoy without someone being hurt,'' said Ms. Boren, who was staying at the Comfort Inn in Kelso, Wash. It was taking their minds off presidential and vice-presidential debates (boring and predictable), they said, the news of the Iraq war and terrorism (depressing) and the 9/11 Commission Report (long, complicated and depressing). Ms. Boren brought the commission report with her up to the mountain but has so far decided not to read it. There is a rhythm to the volcano-watching day. For those staying in nearby hotels, it begins with the latest reports on television, which on both Monday and Tuesday brought what they had been waiting for: word of eruptions, minor but dramatic. With each breathless broadcast new pilgrims come to the mountain. For those already up here, some sleeping here for days now, the mountain had already delivered the news from across the valley and into the sky. Scientists have for days been predicting a more serious eruption of the mountain, which in 1980 produced a large explosion that left 57 dead. But they now say it could take weeks, or may never happen, and after seismic tremors beneath the mountain's lava dome dropped off by Wednesday scientists lowered the volcanic alert level one notch, from ''code red'' to ''code orange.'' The people up here seem to be finding something they need. Colleen Grant, 46, of Coquitlam, British Columbia, said the experience was helping her get over those ''control issues'' her husband teases her about. Forced to surrender to geologic time while waiting for the big one, she found it calming, she said, and with a mixture of serenity and pleasant surprise, added, ''We have no control.'' On Sunday night, in honor of the reddish lava they hoped was rising from within the mountain, Ms. Grant, a lab technologist, and her husband, Rod, a caterer, drank merlot with barbecued steaks and prawns. Late Monday afternoon they sat on chairs atop a fake-grass mat outside their 22-foot mobile home. She was sipping white wine and he was working on a can of Coors. ''We're all here for the same common reason,'' Mr. Grant said. By Tuesday afternoon, after three days on the mountain forced them to move from gourmet food to frozen fare, they had decided to leave. They said they were satisfied after seeing two steam explosions. But a neighbor on the mountain, Judy Ziese, 55, a ''retired housewife'' from Port Angeles, Wash., said she would hold out for the big one, sleeping in her white Ford Expedition, which she was calling her ''Ford Explosion.'' Ms. Ziese's husband declined to join her on this trek more than 200 miles from home, so she packed up almond butter, jam, sprouted-wheat bread, string cheese and set out with her Chihuahua, Peekaboo Louise. ''I could live without a man, but I couldn't live without a dog,'' she said. In the end, however, it was the sun that Ms. Ziese could not live without. She abandoned the mountain after heavy rains arrived Tuesday night, and she joined many others who had apparently re-evaluated their determination to wait for the next spectacle. By Wednesday morning, with St. Helens veiled in clouds and word of the lull in the rumblings spreading, the crowd on the mountain had thinned to only a few stubborn optimists. Brian Landry, 48, from Salem, Ore., said news that the alert level had been lowered did not mean anything to him. ''It might taper off and then all of a sudden decide to uncork,'' he said. Mr. Landry, a test-technician for a high-tech tool manufacturer, had driven two hours to get to the mountain on Sunday with his wife. He then drove her back home so she could work on Monday, turned around, and returned alone. He has now been here for three days straight, sleeping through Tuesday night's rain inside a blue tent and eating hot dogs. ''I'd hate to leave and find something went on,'' he said."
"When Mount St. Helens erupted on May 18, 1980, many observers -- distant observers -- noted that it was probably the best-documented eruption of all time. That was then. Volcanoes haven't changed much in the past 24 years, but documentation has. Mount St. Helens, which began rumbling again last month, is now adorned with an extraordinary array of scientific equipment designed to measure, in incremental detail, every move the mountain makes, every vapor it emits, every tremor it lets slip, every cloud of ash it tosses skyward. These instruments make it possible to predict an explosion with a far greater likelihood of accuracy, and they promise an enormous scientific yield in the event of an explosive eruption. It's strange to look back at that May day when Mount St. Helens blew up, to revisit the video of that astonishing eruption. Everything we put up with in the way of weather, including four hurricanes this season, is in some sense superficial because it takes place on the surface of Earth. But in the workings of a volcano we get a glimpse of processes -- the very kinetics of the planet itself -- that ordinarily remain completely hidden. We also get plenty of smoke and fire. It's no wonder people gather to wait and watch, even if the scene does seem like the moment in a science fiction movie just before the aliens appear and blast everyone in the welcoming crowd. The 1980 eruption ranked, in explosive power, slightly above the Vesuvius eruption that destroyed Pompeii in A.D. 79, but well below the truly epochal events that created the Yellowstone caldera or Crater Lake. Geologists said yesterday that the recent volcanic activity was tapering off, at least for now, and reduced the alert level. Yet these new overtures from Mount St. Helens have been entrancing, whatever comes next. The idea of geological time -- the billions of years of Earth's history -- often feels like a metaphor because the human scale of time is so abbreviated in comparison. But when Mount St. Helens comes to life, we suddenly feel, for a while at least, as if we are living in geological time, too."
"For the first time since Mount St. Helens awakened three weeks ago with earthquake rumblings and several bursts of ash and steam, new lava has pushed through to the surface, geologists reported yesterday. Scientists flying around the crater on Monday spotted a light gray fin-shaped slab of rock, about 200 feet long and 60 feet high, that was not there the day before. Infrared measurements put the temperature of the new rock at 900 to 1,100 degrees. ''Our consensus is there is new magma that has now breached the surface,'' said Dr. Jon J. Major, a geologist with the United States Geological Survey. Small earthquakes started shaking on Sept. 23 around St. Helens, in Washington, which had not erupted since 1986. The first of several emissions of steam and ash shot out of the volcano's crater on Oct. 1. After a largely quiet week, earthquakes resumed over the weekend, leading to new bursts of steam from the volcano on Sunday and Monday. Geologists do not expect the current eruptions to lead to anything similar to the cataclysmic eruption on May 18, 1980, which killed 57 people and blew off the top 1,300 feet of the mountain. Instead, the current activity resembles smaller eruptions that followed, which built up a lava dome about 925 feet high and half a mile wide inside the crater. In recent weeks, the crater floor near the southern part of the lava dome has been pushed up more than 330 feet by rising magma. That is also the location of the steam emissions and the new lava extrusion. ''We are in a period that we are comfortable calling renewed lava dome growth,'' said Dr. Tina Neal of the geological survey. She said the activity was likely to grow and ebb over the coming days, months and perhaps even years. Scientists still do not know how much molten rock has risen into the volcano or even exactly where it is, although they suspect much of it is within half a mile of the surface. More explosive eruptions could still occur, Dr. Neal said, adding: ''We could see an escalation of unrest come on very rapidly, and this could occur without much warning. ''This is the reason we're going to be watching the volcano as closely as we can.''"
"Lots of people here remember well how racked with fear they were in the weeks and days leading up to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, the volcano that rained utter havoc from 30 miles away on this tiny town. But 24 years later, as scientists warn of a new, imminent eruption, the fear has not returned. For one, scientists do not believe the eruption will be nearly as powerful. But also, residents now know the drill, the evacuation routes and the ways to protect themselves and their property from heavy ash fall. Residents are slightly nervous but mostly aggravated at all the local traffic, caused by the thousands of tourists, reporters and entrepreneurs headed through town over the last few days on their way to a lookout point on the mountain. In 1980, once scientists knew that powerful earthquakes were stirring Mount St. Helens, few people were visiting the mountain. Now, a spot at the Castle Lake Lookout parking lot is a rare commodity. And far from running away, people like Denise Horton, who lives 130 miles away in Sandy, Ore., are traveling hours to get here, bursting with anticipation for the eruption. ''It's like waiting for a parade that's late,'' said Ms. Horton, who opened a hot dog stand on the mountain, selling mostly to reporters who were among the dozens camped out at the lookout point. ''It's like waiting for a baby.'' The fact that they are here is testament to the vast forecasting gains of scientists, who are armed with new technology and skills honed from the 1980 eruption, which killed 57 people, obliterated 200 houses and spawned worldwide interest in the study of volcanoes. Seismometers pinpoint the tiny earthquakes that have been shaking Mount St. Helens for the past week and a half. Global positioning system sensors detect outward bulges as slight as a fraction of an inch. Instruments aboard a helicopter sniff out gases seeping out of the rocks below and identify hot spots. ''There's really been a revolution,'' said Dr. William E. Scott of the United States Geological Survey's Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash., which is monitoring the mountain and holding twice-daily news conferences. But for all their high-tech gadgetry, scientists still do not have a direct way to answer the questions they most want to answer: where is the molten rock beneath the volcano? And where is it going? ''We don't know where it is,'' said William Steele, a seismologist at the University of Washington. The expectation is that magma -- underground molten rock -- will reach the surface and spill out as lava and that there will be more eruptions like the small one that happened Friday, or larger. ''Something could happen at any time, basically,'' Dr. Scott said at a news conference on Sunday afternoon. Or, he said, ''It may stall out and we may never see it.'' That would disappoint Kathy Teas, who was living nearby in 1980 and was evacuated from her home. Ms. Teas later moved to Oregon, but on Sunday she was back, having spent the previous night at a campsite on the mountain, eager to see an eruption. ''Here I am at 52 and I'm back here again,'' she said. ''To have the opportunity to witness this is something I can't pass up.'' From the pattern of seismic shakings before and after the 1980 eruption, seismologists laboriously constructed a fuzzy picture of the volcano's workings, the equivalent of a prenatal sonogram. It indicated a deep magma chamber about four miles underground and a shallower one perhaps a mile below the crater. But unlike hurricanes, which allow meteorologists to make detailed observations by airplanes and satellites, a volcano eruption develops mostly out of sight, hundreds to thousands of feet underground. ''We can't take measurements in the interior,'' said Dr. Anthony Qamar, a professor of geophysics at the University of Washington. Information like the volcano's internal temperatures and pressures can only be guessed at. Instruments on or hovering above the surface offer only indirect suggestions of what is happening. Volcanologists must sift through competing plausible explanations for what they observe and what they do not. Thus, when a new event occurs, like the continuous, 50-minute, low-frequency tremor on Saturday, the scientists sometimes need to quickly revise their thoughts. The swarms of earthquakes, a few a minute, have been interpreted as the breaking of rocks by the buildup of pressure. The tremor -- accompanied by a cessation in the earthquakes -- suggested that the magma had broken through and was rising smoothly, leading scientists to suspect an eruption might be imminent. After the tremor ended, the earthquakes resumed. At 3 a.m. Sunday, a second tremor occurred, this time lasting 25 minutes. Again, the seismic activity died down, then picked up. Through the day on Sunday, the intensity of the earthquakes diminished somewhat. ''The larger earthquakes have dropped off,'' Dr. Qamar said. That could mean the pressure had lessened, and the volcano was quieting down. Or it could mean that the magma had broken through the rock blockage and was now pushing its way toward the surface. Or it could just be a lull. ''We're not interpreting much about that decrease,'' Dr. Scott said. What has been unusual about the current episode is that all of the earthquakes have been shallow, within half a mile or so of the surface. That leaves scientists wondering whether magma is rising from the deep chamber or whether the magma driving the tremors and eruptions is left over from six years ago. Then, as now, a swarm of earthquakes shook the area, and scientists believe that magma rose upward beneath the crater, although nothing broke through as an eruption. Whether the magma is new or old is important, because that could determine whether the eruptions will explosively shoot clouds of ash that spread over a large area or, less catastrophically, just push out lava. ''The analogy is the old Coke can that you shake up and open,'' Dr. Scott said. ''If you shake it a whole lot and pop it open, you're going to get a lot of frothing and it's going to be an explosive event. But if you pour it in a glass and let the gas come out and then you try to shake the glass, you can't get as much fizz.'' Once scientists realized this weekend that an eruption could be imminent, spectators were ordered to leave an observatory five miles from the crater. But lookout points farther away were not considered to be in danger. Here in Toutle (pronounced TOOT-el), a town of 700 that is the closest to the mountain, many residents said that while they were not panicking, they were concerned about an eruption causing a mudflow into the three nearby rivers, which were flooded and full of floating debris in 1980. ''All I can say is you better learn to respect it,'' Karen Meyers, 43, who lives in Toutle and witnessed the 1980 eruption. ''I mean, last time, their worst-case scenario didn't even come close to what happened here. Mother Nature is going to win and you'll pay hell trying to predict it.''"
"Scientists monitoring Mount St. Helens, which erupted Friday for the first time in 18 years with a minor explosion, said on Saturday that they were expecting a more powerful eruption within a day or so. The government raised the advisory for volcanic activity to Level 3, the equivalent of a ''code red'' and the highest stage in a system used to indicate the likelihood of a volcanic eruption that could endanger life or property. The government scientists had earlier said they expected to see more small to moderate explosions after a series of earthquakes culminated in a plume of steam and ash on Friday, rising 10,000 feet into the air but posing no threat to health or safety. But on Saturday, the earthquakes intensified, and shortly after noon, the volcano emitted a brief burst of steam, which was followed by a continuous, low-frequency tremor that lasted 50 minutes, believed to be caused by the movement of magma, or molten rock, underground. That suddenly created a more serious situation at Mount St. Helens, the most active volcano in the lower 48 states. But scientists said they did not expect an eruption on the magnitude of the May 1980 explosion that killed 57 people and caused widespread destruction. Officials on Saturday evacuated an observatory five miles from the crater and warned that people with respiratory diseases could be affected if large amounts of ash became airborne. Hundreds of excited tourists who had flocked to Mount St. Helens in recent days were forced to move to a lookout point several miles below the observatory, causing a deep traffic jam on the one winding road that leads from this small town in southwestern Washington up to the mountain. The 2,100 residents of this town and others near the mountain, however, were not evacuated. Officials, including Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton, who held a news conference Saturday afternoon in nearby Vancouver, Wash., said their houses were far enough away -- 30 miles to the west -- to be safe. ''This is red alert,'' Ms. Norton said, adding, ''Overall, we are very fortunate that no one lives directly in the area that would be most impacted.'' C. Daniel Miller, a scientist at the United States Geological Survey, said he expected an eruption ''larger than what we saw on Friday, probably by quite a bit.'' The 50-minute tremor ''is the kind of seismic signal that occurs not when rock is breaking, but when magma is actually moving up in the throat of the volcano,'' Dr. Miller said at a news conference Saturday evening. ''That's the sort of thing that frankly sends a chill up the back of a volcanologist,'' he said. Scientists said yesterday that they saw more signs of deformation at the south side of the lava dome, a half-mile wide, 925-foot high bulge at the center of the volcano's crater that was created by eruptions between 1980 and 1986. The crew aboard a helicopter taking measurements Saturday reported the smell of rotten eggs, probably hydrogen sulfide emanating from magma. Until then, scientists had not detected significant amounts of volcanic gases. Gas-rich magma is more likely to erupt explosively. The greatest danger was expected to be potentially large ash plumes, which could shoot tens of thousands of feet up. The ash could be accompanied by lava flow and possibly blow much farther northwest, depending on the weather, and cause health problems for anyone with asthma or other respiratory diseases, said Dr. Thomas Pierson, a geologist with the geological survey. And if the mountain glacier melted as a result of an eruption, it could create a ''debris flow'' cascading down the mountain, officials said. The earthquakes recorded over the past week, subsiding briefly after the Friday explosion, were the most intense seismic activity on the mountain since before the massive May 1980 eruption. Before Friday, the mountain had been dormant for 18 years. Scientists said they had initially expected any eruption to be fairly minor, but were now saying it could be more serious. Castle Rock residents, many of whom witnessed the 1980 explosion, which dumped truckloads of ash on this town, seemed to be taking the new development in stride and expressed little worry on Saturday, saying nothing could compare to the 1980 event. ''I know it might sound like the strangest thing in the world,'' said Laura Dodd, the owner of Lady Bug Antiques in downtown Castle Rock, who observed scores of tourists passing through town Saturday on their way to or from the mountain. ''But the locals are not taking it very seriously. ''We're just watching,'' she said. ''It's exciting, but we're not really frightened or anxious.'' Bobbie Stout, the cashier at North Fork Survivors, a novelty shop on Route 504 about 25 miles west of the mountain, said she had seen cars ''rushing up the mountain'' before they were evacuated Saturday afternoon, and that there was an excitement in the air. ''I lived through the first one,'' Ms. Stout said, adding that she was slightly concerned about the glacier melting but otherwise calm. ''I'm not all that nervous.'' Correction: October 5, 2004, Tuesday Because of an editing error, a picture caption in some copies on Sunday with an article about the likelihood of more eruptions at Mount St. Helens misspelled the name of an observatory where spectators were told to evacuate. It is the Johnston Ridge Observatory, not Johnson."
"When Mount St. Helens was last erupting in the 1980's, Dr. Elliot Endo recalls using a ruler to measure the size of the squiggles on seismographs. Now he tracks St. Helens with a high-end cellphone. ''I look at my plots on a Treo 600, and it's really cool,'' said Dr. Endo, scientist-in-charge at the United States Geological Survey's Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash. Technology developed over the last two decades ''has allowed us to do a better job of monitoring and allowed us to interpret the data much more quickly,'' he said. It has also made the work safer. Dr. David A. Johnston, a 30-year-old geologist with the geological survey, was one of 57 killed by the eruption of Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980, because he was at an observation post five miles from the volcano. Today scientists observe the volcanoes from much greater distances. Global positioning system sensors send signals to orbiting satellites, which triangulate the sensors' locations within a fraction of an inch. Radar from other satellites provides a three-dimensional view of the landscape and detects subtle deformations as magma pushes up from below. Those data fly across the Internet to scientists around the world. ''In 1980, we had to rely on surveying techniques that required people on the ground and clear weather in order to be able to see targets,'' Dr. William E. Scott, a geological survey scientist, said at a news conference last week. When St. Helens reawakened three weeks ago, scientists were better prepared to analyze the situation. So far, they expect some eruptions, but nothing approaching the 1980 cataclysm. In 1980, scientists did catch the warning signs of an impending eruption. Swarms of earthquakes and the appearance of a bulge alerted them, and they persuaded officials to close surrounding areas, saving lives. But they were still caught off guard by the ferocity of the eruption, which sent up a cloud of ash that blanketed the Pacific Northwest and carried as far as Oklahoma. ''People decided we better try to work at understanding what's happening inside volcanoes,'' said Dr. Bernard Chouet of the geological survey's volcano hazards program. Most volcanoes form at the edges of tectonic plates, where hotter material can rise up from below, although a few, like those in Hawaii, occur in the middle of a plate. Those, most geologists believe, are created by hot plumes of rock rising from the core, melting the underside of the earth's crust. Whether an erupting volcano explodes, raining ash over a wide region, or less destructively dribbles out lava depends primarily on the amount of water in the molten rock. As the underground molten rock, or magma, moves toward the surface, the water, held in by extreme pressures underground, separates out and turns into the steam. That provides the explosive potential. (Hawaiian volcanoes rarely spew ash. In the plume model, the reason for the smooth flowing lava is that deep magmas contain little water.) Dr. Chouet, working on St. Helens during smaller eruptions after May 1980, noticed that the seismic signals from earthquakes around volcanoes were different from those from ordinary earthquakes. When an earthquake fault slips, breaking rocks, the seismograph reading is a messy, patternless jumble of squiggle. But around St. Helens, the seismic signal often contained a single characteristic frequency, almost as if the earth were singing a particular note. Indeed, steam rising up through rock cracks resonates ''almost like an organ pipe,'' Dr. Chouet said. Such resonant earthquakes, particularly if nothing is occurring at the surface, indicates pressures are building, he said. Dr. Chouet said that in the current volcanic episode at St. Helens, the seismic signals of the initial earthquakes, which started Sept. 23, looked like just the breaking of rocks. About four or five days later, the resonant signal appeared. The first steam and ash eruption occurred Oct. 1. To get a better idea of the plumbing below some of the world's most worrisome volcanoes, scientists have made what are essentially sonograms of the earth. At Mount Vesuvius in Italy, scientists set off a series of small explosions around the mountain and then precisely measured the seismic signals. The carefully monitored mountain has been quiet of late, but the data showed a large magma chamber exists about six miles below the mountain. ''This is quite large,'' said Marcello Martini of the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Naples. ''The problem is we don't know how deep this goes. We know the top level of this magma chamber.'' A similar underground image created for Mount Kilauea in Hawaii showed a complex network of fractures carrying the magma to the surface. While most textbooks depict a single chamber of magma underground with a large conduit leading to a volcano's crater, ''We're finding there is no such thing,'' Dr. Chouet said. ''It's going to be much richer than the simple picture you see in textbooks.'' Technology for measuring volcanic gases has also improved. The amount of steam rising out of a crater does not tell by itself much about the explosive potential of the magma below because the steam could have come from water percolating down from above and boiling when it hit the magma. Accompanying water in magma, however, are three other gases: carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide. In 1980, scientists could detect only sulfur dioxide, but sulfur dioxide dissolves in water, and that could lead to misleadingly low measurements. Now instruments exist to measure all three. Even precise gas measurements are not enough to predict the explosiveness of an eruption. Dr. Michael Manga, a professor of earth and planetary science at the University of California at Berkeley, said identical gas-rich magma coming out of the same volcano would not always produce the same eruption. ''Sometimes it explodes, and sometimes it doesn't,'' he said. ''How you get gases out of a volcano is an interesting question. You would think after hundreds of years of studying volcanoes, we'd have that answer. But we don't.'' So a member of his research group, Dr. Atsuko Namiki, built a volcano in the basement at Berkeley to help provide answers. Instead of red-hot magma, the model volcano erupts gooey xanthan gum, a food additive used as a thickener in pudding, fruit fillings and chewing gum. ''We want to do this at room temperature,'' Dr. Manga said. Dissolving the gum in water and infusing it with bubbles, Dr. Namiki videotaped the behavior of the gum when the surrounding pressure was suddenly released. That simulates what happens to magma as it rises toward the surface. To erupt explosively, the magma must break into pieces. On the other hand, if all the gas escapes before the magma reaches the surface, there is no force left to throw the magma into the air. ''We can vary all these parameters and conditions in the lab,'' Dr. Manga said. ''We can use models to extrapolate to real volcanoes.'' In 1980, a magnitude 5.2 earthquake on the morning of May 18 caused the bulge on the northern flank of Mount St. Helens to slide away. That uncovered the highly pressurized magma below, like popping a cork from a Champagne bottle. The analogous xanthan gum lava also exploded. ''Our lab experiments are at least consistent with Mount St Helens,'' Dr. Manga said."
"For the fifth straight day, Mount St. Helens let out a burst of steam and ash yesterday, similar to the earlier bursts that have risen out of the crater and perhaps larger. But with that exhalation, the volcano dozed off, and the earthquakes that have shaken the area in Washington State almost continually for two weeks stopped almost entirely. ''The seismicity dropped off quite dramatically,'' said Dr. Steve Malone, the director of the seismology lab at the University of Washington. The earthquakes began Sept. 23, when Mount St. Helens began to revive, and gradually increased in intensity and pace, culminating in an eruption of steam and ash on Friday, the first eruption since 1986. The earthquakes tailed off briefly but returned in an hour or two and became stronger. On Saturday, at the peak of seismic unrest, three to four quakes a minute shook St. Helens, with the larger ones, between magnitude 2 and magnitude 3, occurring every couple of minutes. After yesterday's steam burst, the larger earthquakes ceased completely, and the pace of the smaller ones, almost all below magnitude 1, slowed to one or two per minute. ''That is an indication perhaps that it's running out of energy,'' William Steele, another seismologist at the University of Washington, said. ''Maybe it's accomplished what it's going to do.'' So far, Mount St. Helens has done relatively little compared with the months leading up to its cataclysmic 1980 eruption. Then, a large bulge formed on the volcano's northern flank, rising five feet a day. By May 18, 1980, the bulge had been pushed upward and outward by more than 450 feet when a magnitude-5.1 earthquake hit, and the bulge collapsed in a landslide. That, in effect, took the lid off the magma underground, and later that day, Mount St. Helens explosively erupted, killing 57 people. This time, global positioning system sensors detect no movement on the volcano's outer flanks. The only deformation is within St. Helens' mile-wide crater, on the southern side of a lava dome that built up during smaller eruptions from 1980 to 1986. Over the last two weeks, that part of the dome has cracked as it has been lifted about 100 feet. Infrared images have detected spots on the dome 35 to 70 degrees warmer than the surrounding rock, said Dr. Jacob B. Lowenstern of the United States Geological Survey. The steam eruptions have emanated from beneath a horseshoe-shaped glacier that wraps around the lava dome. The steam has melted a pond about 100 feet wide, the waters roiling with bubbles of hot volcanic gases rising from the magma. Dr. Lowenstern said he doubted that the lull in earthquakes signaled the end of the current episode. ''The magma is still coming up,'' he said. ''I think we expect more of the kinds of explosions that we've seen over the last few days, and it wouldn't be surprising to see more evidence of magma reaching the surface.''"
"The telephone was ringing all afternoon on Friday at the Flower Cellar here in this small town in the shadow of Mount St. Helens. Callers were, as Shelby Gourde, the floral designer, said, ''abuzz with the news.'' The news was big. After almost two decades of dormancy, Mount St. Helens was stirring again. It erupted in a huge explosion in 1980, killing 57 people; blasting off its top; wiping out entire forests; sending houses, cars and refrigerators careering down the Cowlitz River; and dumping so much ash here and on other towns across the Northwest that the ash had to be shoveled out like snow for weeks. This week, a series of earthquakes beneath the lava dome of the most active volcano in the lower 48 states culminated on Friday in a small explosion that sent a cinematic miles-high plume of steam and ash into the sky. The explosion, predicted for several days and posing no imminent danger to people in the region, was greeted with jaw-dropping delight by the many thrill seekers and reporters who had gone to the mountain for an edge-of-the-seat volcano watch. Government scientists said that the explosion could be one of several small to moderate eruptions that might occur in the restless mountain some time soon and that the quakes recorded in the last week were the same signs that foreshadowed the 1980 eruption. But the scientists said even if further and possibly more powerful explosions occurred, they would be far less destructive than the 1980 eruption, possibly spewing ash and ''fist size'' rock chunks in a three-mile radius, dozens of miles from the nearest houses. The reaction among residents in this city of 2,000 people 100 miles south of Seattle and in surrounding communities was summed up by Ms. Gourde. ''At this point,'' she said, ''it was almost just like a little burp. I think most of us are just kind of waiting for the next action. And there's a little bit of excitement that, hey, it finally did something.'' Far from the dread accompanying, say, a Florida hurricane or a California earthquake, the reaction here to St. Helens's rumblings is nothing close to panic or fear. Instead, there are nervous wonder and curiosity from tourists, hikers and residents, hopes that new activity will increase tourism in Castle Rock, which built up a small industry and a brand identity around the mythic fascination with volcanoes. ''Castle Rock, Where Mount St. Helens Happened!'' reads the town brochure. A movie theater features ''Experience the Eruption,'' a film that shows every 45 minutes, and around the region, gift shops and restaurants sell tiny bottles of ash for $3.50, ''Ashware,'' dishes and other items made from blown ash, along with ''volcano burgers.'' Among residents who are finding themselves stuck in traffic jams because of the interest in visiting the mountain, there is sheer stoicism, too. ''If it blows, it blows,'' said Lyle West, a resident who was here during the 1980 eruption. ''I'm not worried,'' said Walter Hollaway, a yard worker who lunches daily at Harry R. Truman Memorial Park , where a giant headstone pays tribute to Mr. Truman, the legendary mountain holdout, an 83-year-old lodge owner who died in 1980 under a cascade of ash after refusing to leave his home and lodge near the base of the mountain. ''Maybe it will really be something,'' Mr. Hollaway added, sounding a bit tickled and glancing at the headstone. ''Old Mr. Truman, I'm sure he's getting excited.'' Government geologists said they saw no immediate health or safety threat to nearby residents. ''There is no increase right now in hazards for downwind communities,'' Catherine Puckett, a spokeswoman for the United States Geological Survey, said. ''There is no threat to life or property, unless people are doing foolish things.'' Ms. Puckett said that the Federal Aviation Administration and the airport at Portland, Ore., the closest airport, had been informed of the eruption and that some flights had been delayed. She also said she had received reports of ash landing on cars in Portland and Vancouver, Wash. Although there was little worry among residents in Castle Rock and 10 miles east in Toutle, the new activity has freshened the memories of 1980. It was early on a May morning when Jim Nugent peered out the window of his house on a winding road in Toutle, 30 miles west of the mountain, and saw a plume of ash that eventually lurched 80,000 feet in the air. He recalled that he telephoned the sheriff, saying, '''Mount St. Helen's is in a massive eruption.''' ''It looked like a giant head of cauliflower tumbling down off the mountain,'' he said. Mr. Nugent grabbed his hunting rifle, went back to the house to grab his wife's rifle and fled. Nine neighbors were killed, including Mr. Truman, whom Mr. Nugent knew well and described as, ''pretty stubborn -- he called the shots the way they were.'' In the last few days, officials in southwestern Washington and in Portland, a city that officials fear could become coated with ash blowing south from the mountain in the event of further explosions, have prepared evacuation plans and taken other precautions. As of Friday afternoon no areas were evacuated. Mr. Nugent, who has four grown sons living elsewhere in Washington, said they were calling him, concerned. He told them not to worry. ''It can't do the damage it did originally, because a lot of it's not there anymore,'' Mr. Nugent said, referring to the fact that more than 1,000 feet of the mountain, or one-third of it, was blown off in 1980. ''Anyway, there isn't much we can do about it.'' Correction: October 14, 2004, Thursday An article on Oct. 2 about the eruption of Mount St. Helens misstated the name of a park in Castle Rock, Wash., that has a memorial to Harry R. Truman, who was killed in an explosion of the volcano in 1980 after refusing to leave his home at the base of the mountain. It is Castle Rock Lions Club Volunteer Park; it is no longer named for Mr. Truman."
"Just before noon, seismometers at the Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash., wiggled yesterday in a familiar pattern. Soon afterward came confirmation that Mount St. Helens had erupted for the first time since 1986. After the mountain's cataclysmic explosion in 1980, the volcano erupted more modestly an additional 21 times, each usually accompanied by a characteristic seismic signal. ''Events like this were very common between 1981 and 1985, so this is not unusual or extraordinary by any means,'' Dr. Jon J. Major, a geologist at the observatory, said at a news conference yesterday afternoon. Mount St. Helens is one of several large volcanoes in Washington, Oregon and California that are part of the tectonically active Ring of Fire around the Pacific Ocean. The volcanoes can lie dormant for centuries, then revive, sometimes catastrophically. Before 1980, Mount St. Helens had last erupted in 1857. The pulsations of steam and dust yesterday, described by Dr. Major as ''a relatively small burp,'' sent a gray-white plume nearly 10,000 feet into the air. After the eruption, small earthquakes that had been rumbling around the volcano for the last week stopped, suggesting that pressures that had been building up had been relieved for now. Seismic activity resumed later in the afternoon, Dr. Major said, but at a quieter level. ''This event is pretty much what we expected and anticipated over the last several days, a relatively small explosion from the lava dome,'' Dr. Major said. Scientists cannot say whether the volcano will now calm down or whether more eruptions will occur. At the time of the eruption, scientists aboard a helicopter were taking measurements using a thermal imager, a device that measures heat from a distance. The instrument's readings showed that the site of the eruption was not particularly hot, indicating that the eruption of steam and ash had originated from at least several hundred yards underground. The flow of water out of the crater increased slightly, Dr. Major said, but there was no danger of floods or mudslides. Scientists said they saw no signs that would lead them to worry that a larger, dangerous eruption was imminent. ''There is no indication magma has worked its way up to the surface,'' Dr. Major said. The belch yesterday might have instead been the denouement of some underground indigestion from six years ago. Then, as in the last week, a swarm of small quakes rumbled around the dome, a bulge 925 feet high and a half-mile wide at the center of the crater, but then the ground quieted without a new eruption. Analyzing the patterns of shaking, scientists said fresh magma, molten rock, had risen from deep below to the base of the dome, but had not broken through to the surface. Dr. Major said the working hypothesis was that the eruption yesterday was somehow related to the 1998 events. ''Exactly how it is related is still a matter of speculation,'' he said."
"Heightening the suspense over what a quivering Mount St. Helens may do next -- and delighting thousands of tourists -- the volcano spewed a cloud of steam on Monday morning and sputtered another picturesque puff later. Those events, after the mountain erupted Friday for the first time in 18 years, were less serious than what scientists monitoring the mountain had expected. They continued to say Monday that a more significant eruption was likely. In 1980, a huge eruption killed 57 people, spread tons of ash across the region and set off a powerful landslide. Scientists said that even if their predictions, which led to a ''code red'' alert for an imminent eruption, came true, further eruptions would be far less devastating than the 1980 explosion. ''There may be some explosions, and some of those explosions may be relatively large, larger than we've seen,'' Jake Lowenstern, a volcanologist with the United States Geological Survey, said at a news conference in the afternoon. At 9:47 a.m., a steam plume 1,000 to 2,000 feet above the lip of the crater, or 10,000 feet in the air, billowed up. Scientists said the most likely cause was ''hot material'' contacting glacier water, causing boiling and a burst of steam. Little ash, the greatest health concern downwind, was emitted, scientists said. Expected eruptions, foreshadowed by tremors and a steady swarm of earthquakes, could bring more ash, they said. Scientists are closely watching the movement of molten rock, or magma, that they said was slowly pushing upward and could erupt explosively, throwing ash or adding to the 925-foot-tall, half-mile-wide lava dome created after the 1980 explosion. The scientists are analyzing ash samples to gauge ''magma on the move,'' as well as measuring the presence of volcanic gases that would indicate that the magma is moving closer to the surface and could lead to a more serious eruption than the one on Friday. On Monday, the scientists said they had detected an increased level of potentially explosive gases. Visitors' centers and vantage points on the mountain -- the one closest to the crater was closed and evacuated Saturday -- continue to register record numbers of tourists, many traveling long distances and carting cameras, generators, coolers and other provisions. Debbi Pflughoeft, 49, a retired secretary from Rogue River, Ore., saw the morning explosion and was still at the Coldwater Ridge Visitor Center, five miles from the crater, when another small steam eruption occurred shortly after 2 p.m. Leaning over a metal rail outside the center, pressing her eye to her camera lens, Ms. Pflughoeft caught the puff on film, shouting, ''Come on baby, sing for us!'' ''I love volcanoes, I always have,'' said Ms. Pflughoeft, adding that she and her husband, who live 265 miles away, were traveling on a tight budget but were hoping to stay in the region as long as they could. ''It's just kind of a primal connection to creation.''"
