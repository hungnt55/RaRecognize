"Chris and Mandi Hunt stood in front of their house here on Tuesday and watched as a backhoe scooped what was left of it into a dump truck. In what had been their living room, a child's board game sat on the floor amid Monopoly money, in a heap of timber, broken glass and insulation. Ms. Hunt pointed to the hallway closet, where the couple and their two daughters had huddled as Mr. Hunt struggled to hold the door shut against the winds of a tornado. As he grasped the knob, the door was ripped from its hinges and out of his hand, and it whirled into another room. The parents prayed. The girls screamed. When the tornado had passed, the family found that it had laid open their home, toppling the walls and tossing off the roof. Debris had fallen on their daughters' beds, where they would have been sleeping. But the couple's made bed was untouched, and a candle Ms. Hunt had lighted still burned at the bedside. ''It's sad,'' Mr. Hunt said. ''Everything that's ever been done to that house, we did it. We did it with our hands.'' The Hunts were not alone. Across Dyer County and neighboring Gibson County, stunned homeowners returned to their houses, some merely damaged, some obliterated, for the slow and painful process of searching for scattered belongings and deciding what to do. Tennessee was one of eight states where tornadoes touched down on Sunday evening. But the enormous tornado that raged across the two counties, and a less powerful one to the north, created the greatest destruction. Of 28 people who died throughout the South and the Midwest, 24 died in the two Tennessee counties. Hundreds of homes were damaged or destroyed. Convoys of utility trucks rumbled along the streets, and bucket loaders hoisted workers up to replace downed power lines. The sound of generators, chainsaws and chippers roared in the neighborhoods where trees still rested on the roadsides and vast piles of brush were piled in yards. The storms left a gash of ruin and debris, transforming the landscape as a vast swath of wreckage was scattered in fields and in ditches. Gov. Phil Bredesen toured the two counties on Tuesday. One of the officials with him was Representative John Tanner, a Democrat. Mr. Tanner's cousin Janie King was among those killed on Sunday. ''As bad as the property damage is, it can be replaced,'' Mr. Tanner said. ''It's just stuff. The loss of life -- my family isn't the only one that suffered -- is something that's forever. You've got to get through the grief for the people that died, and the rebuilding will take place in due course.'' When Billy Sisk left for work last Sunday, his one-story house was a solid concrete-and-timber monument to hard work. When Mr. Sisk returned after the tornado had ripped through, little was left: the cinderblock foundation, the front porch, the furnace pointing skyward amid the ruins. On Tuesday, Mr. Sisk, 39, picked his way among the debris, poking through a splintered cabinet and scanning the ground for anything salvageable. His family's possessions were scattered around him as he made his way through the yard, passing an electric meat cleaver, a boot, a child's arrow, a muddy phone receiver. ''When we got back here the next morning, we didn't have a house,'' Mr. Sisk said. ''You work hard all these years and try to have something in life, and in a split second, it's gone.'' Mr. Sisk was at work on Sunday night when his wife, Betty, and two children had to cling together inside a closet as the house disintegrated around them. The tornado flung Ms. Sisk and the two children into the yard. They later found out that the couple next door had been killed, along with their infant grandchild. ''It's something you see on TV,'' Ms. Sisk said. ''It's something you read about, but it's not something you ever think about. You can't grasp it.''"
"Courtney Rodemeyer, a sophomore at the University of Iowa, ran to the basement of the Alpha Chi Omega house Thursday night after the first tornado warning sounded. She was under a table when the twister, part of a series that hit the state, struck. ''It sounded like a freight train coming right at us,'' said Ms. Rodemeyer, 19, still shaken Friday morning outside the sorority house, with cuts from flying glass on her face and legs. ''Then it just got so quiet, and the pressure started building up. My ears are still ringing.'' Ms. Rodemeyer was one of many residents assessing their losses on Friday after one or two tornadoes ripped through this university town, toppling power lines, splintering giant oaks and peeling the walls and roofs off dozens of buildings, including Ms. Rodemeyer's 100-year-old sorority house. Damage on the campus was limited to a parking garage for university vehicles and some downed trees. It is tornado season in the Midwest, and while Iowa City is accustomed to storm warnings, a tornado has not touched down near campus in at least 35 years, said Phillip E. Jones, the university's dean of students. The town of 60,000 residents, half of them students, came to a standstill Friday as people gathered to see the damage: the Dairy Queen demolished, cars overturned, half of the roof torn off of St. Patrick's Catholic Church, traffic lights snapped off their poles. About a dozen people were treated for minor injuries at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, and two were admitted for further treatment, said Tom Moore, a spokesman for the hospitals. The university's president, David J. Skorton, said, ''If you think about the capriciousness with which the tornado touched down, we were very, very lucky.'' Dr. Skorton canceled classes on Friday, concerned that downed power lines and gas leaks might endanger students. ''It's the sort of town where hundreds of students walk through downtown from Point A to Point B,'' he said. ''We wanted to first make sure the general environment was safe.'' Five or six tornadoes whipped through eastern Iowa on Thursday, killing a woman in Nichols about 20 miles away. They cut a path three and a half miles long and one-third of a mile wide, said Donna Dubberke, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The storm, called a supercell because of its deep rotating updraft, generated winds of up to 150 miles per hour. About 6,500 Iowa City residents lost electrical power Thursday night, but it was restored to all but about 1,100 by late Friday, said Allan Urlis, a spokesman for MidAmerican Energy. Ms. Rodemeyer and her 42 sorority sisters were among several dozen students left homeless, Dr. Skorton said. The storm collapsed the third floor of the sorority house and peeled off one side, exposing the students' rooms as if it were a giant dollhouse. About two dozen people used city shelters Thursday night, said Peter Teahen, a spokesman for the local chapter of the American Red Cross. Dr. Skorton said, ''I'm 26 years on this campus, and it was terrifying for me to hear the sirens and to see firsthand the destruction around campus.'' He said he expected classes to resume Monday, but had not made a final decision. For her part, Ms. Rodemeyer is not sure what she will do. ''I have no books, no notes, and our room is the one with no roof at all and almost no walls,'' she said. ''It's not like I can really go to class. I'm going home for Easter weekend, and then I'll figure out what's next.''"
"Thunderstorms that generated tornadoes up to a half-mile wide and hailstones the size of softballs roared across eight states in the Midwest and South on Sunday night, killing at least 27 people, injuring hundreds, destroying thousands of homes and businesses and knocking out power to tens of thousands. Aerial and ground surveillance yesterday showed that northwest Tennessee was the hardest hit. Tornadoes that slashed through five counties there killed 23 people, including an 11-month-old boy, his grandparents and a family of four, officials said. Three deaths were reported in neighboring Missouri, and one person died in Illinois when high winds brought down the roof of a clothing store. There was no immediate estimate of the losses, but the scale of the damage -- spread over parts of Iowa, Kentucky, Ohio, Arkansas and Indiana, as well as Tennessee, Missouri and Illinois -- suggested tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars. Churches, firehouses, police stations and schools, as well as homes and businesses, were shattered, and, as in Hurricane Katrina, many families lost everything. As rescue teams with dogs sought survivors in the rubble of many communities yesterday, state and local officials surveyed wreckage, utility crews struggled in a wilderness of downed trees and power lines and witnesses told of howling twisters that crushed people in their homes and wiped out whole sections of several small towns. ''It just came up all of a sudden,'' Betty Sisk said of the tornado that scythed through Newbern, Tenn., population 2,500. ''I was at the front door and had the kids in the closet, and I ran to the closet and shut the door and put covers over us. We locked arms.'' She said the house suddenly disintegrated around them, and she, her son and daughter were hurled apart. ''It picked us up and tore the house apart,'' Mrs. Sisk told The Associated Press. ''Debris was going here and there. It jerked my daughter away from me and threw her one way and took my son and I a couple of feet away. She crawled to us after we started hollering at each other. Then we laid there on the ground. I told them to be real still.'' Most of the deaths occurred in Tennessee's Dyer and Gibson Counties along a 25-mile swath from Newbern to Bradford, 80 miles northeast of Memphis. Gov. Phil Bredesen of Tennessee said he would visit the two sparsely populated counties today and asked President Bush to declare them federal disaster areas. In Dyer County, 15 people were killed, most of them in the collapse of homes. In Dyersburg, the county seat, refugees took shelter and were fed at a school. Outside, the path of a tornado a half-mile wide was apparent in the moonscape of shattered homes and bare foundations, splintered and uprooted trees, piles of clothing, furniture and rubble. Sheriff Jeff Holt said 100 homes had been hit. In Gibson County, officials said eight people were killed, including a young couple and their two sons, ages 5 and 3, and an infant and the grandparents who were baby-sitting for him in Bradford. Dozens of people were injured, many with broken bones and puncture wounds from flying debris, while 17 were hospitalized in critical condition. Officials said more than 1,200 buildings were damaged. Donnie Smith, a spokesman for the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency, said, ''For that little stretch of destruction that ran through those counties, that's about as bad as it can be.'' In southeastern Missouri, a tornado caused wide damage but no deaths in Caruthersville, a city of 6,700, said Mayor Diane Sayre. Susie Stonner, a spokeswoman for the Missouri Emergency Management Agency, said 60 percent of the town was damaged. Elsewhere in Missouri, three people died of storm-related injuries, including a 42-year-old man in Stoddard County whose trailer was flipped and hurled into a tree by winds that gusted from 60 to 80 miles an hour. In the St. Louis suburb of Fairview Heights, Ill., a 54-year-old man was killed when the roof of a clothing store collapsed on him, the police said. In Arkansas, hailstones four inches in diameter slammed through roofs, and a dozen tornadoes struck various parts of the state. One destroyed nearly half the town of Marmaduke. Brick shells and wooden splinters were all that remained of some homes, and railroad cars toppled from tracks attested to the power of a twister. The Tennessee Valley Authority estimated that more than 15,000 customers remained without power yesterday. In Missouri and Illinois, 57,892 of the 2.4 million customers of Ameren remained without power late in the day, while service had been restored to 200,000 customers, a spokesman said. Full power was not expected for days, or perhaps weeks, in some areas. The National Weather Service said the wild storms developed on Sunday as a cold front from the west slammed into a mass of warm, humid air standing over the Midwest. The service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Okla., said it had reports of 63 tornadoes in the eight-state region. In Dyersburg, Charlotte Sweat, 49, picked over the ruins of her home, which had been pushed off its foundation into a ravine. ''We're just lucky to be alive,'' Ms. Sweat said, recalling her family's desperate race in two cars to escape the twister. ''There are a lot of people that didn't make it, and we did.'' She continued, ''We don't have anything but the clothes we're wearing, but we have our lives.''"
"Jack Melancon lost his shrimp nets and his roof to Hurricane Katrina last year and the rest of his house to flooding from Hurricane Rita. So when he awoke Monday morning to the groan of a tornado advancing on his government-issued trailer home here about 60 miles south of New Orleans, Mr. Melancon, a commercial fisherman, was certain he was about to take a third strike. Skipping across the wind-driven waters of Bayou Lafourche, the tornado toppled trailers and cut shrimp boats free, driving one into a natural gas pipeline that was quickly turned off. Two people suffered minor injuries. The tornado snatched the roof from the house of Mr. Melancon's father and the siding from the house of his brother. Then it hurled debris against Mr. Melancon's trailer, provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Short-lived banshee winds strained to pull the trailer from the soggy earth, but metal straps held it firm. The storm then veered north and disappeared. ''It rocked and it rolled and it shook and it blew,'' Mr. Melancon said. ''The trailer did its job. I would recommend one of these to anybody.''"
"A volatile storm system killed at least 12 people and injured dozens more across the Southeast before heading north, prompting forecasters to issue flash-flood warnings from Virginia to Maine. Powerful winds and tornadoes ripped off roofs, demolished houses, tossed trucks and toppled trees in six states, leaving at least 13,500 people without power. Forecasters said that though the storms were weakening, coastal and low-lying areas farther up the coast should look out for heavy rains, flooding and downed power lines through Friday morning. One tornado that hit a mobile home park near Riegelwood, N.C., around 7 a.m. Thursday was responsible for many of the fatalities. ''It appears that the tornado touched down in a mobile home area,'' said Gov. Michael F. Easley of North Carolina in an afternoon news conference. It damaged 30 to 40 houses, skipped over a highway and leveled some brick houses on the other side, Mr. Easley said. Alton Edwards, the retired chief of Acme-Delco Riegelwood Fire and Rescue, responded to the scene and likened it to a war zone. ''It was total devastation,'' he said. ''It looked almost like the mobile homes had exploded from the ground up.'' That twister killed at least eight adults and children there and sent about 20 more people to the hospital, Mr. Easley said. Mr. Edwards said he had seen an elderly couple lying in a yard, 150 feet from their overturned trailer, and found a member of the fire and rescue unit who had been killed. Lillian Graham, 63, of the East Arcadia Fire Department, arrived at the scene early in the morning and saw the tornado move along its path, apparently throwing people out of their trailers. ''We saw trees had been broken like sticks,'' Ms. Graham said in a telephone interview. ''The tornado was above ground, it went over a brick house and two or three trailers and hit the ground. It then picked up one trailer, took it over the top of trees for about 30 or 40 feet or more, slammed it down and broke it into pieces.'' She said bodies were found in front of patches of earth where a trailer had been. ''Another worker came out of the woods and said: 'There are bodies all over here. I can't take it. I am leaving,' '' she said. Thirty families are now housed in a local shelter, Mr. Easley said. The major highway through the area, North Carolina 87, was closed because it was blocked by debris. Ron Steve, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the service was unlikely to be able to measure the strength of the Riegelwood tornado until Friday. But the twister was forceful enough to send Martin Brown, 39, of Riegelwood, diving under a kitchen table when he saw it barreling toward his house. ''It was nothing but a big old brown twister coming straight at me,'' Mr. Brown said. ''I thought I was going to die.'' He watched as his refrigerator was blown away, and the brick and cinderblock walls of his house started to crumble. One wall fell against the table, shielding him from flying debris. He survived with only scratches and cuts. Some Riegelwood residents said that they were awakened early by what sounded like a hurricane. ''The rain was pounding and beating on the windows of the house,'' said Marjorie Graham, 46, a teacher. ''The wind was strong. When I looked out the window, I could see the leaves and branches breaking off the trees.'' Ms. Graham said her aunt had been at the site helping to pull bodies from the wreckage, but she became so overwhelmed that she eventually left. ''That one came up out of nowhere,'' Ms. Graham said of the storm. ''They had forecast heavy rain, but we didn't realize the wind was going to be so severe.'' The tornado was one of at least a dozen generated by a pair of storm systems with fierce winds and torrential rainfall that moved across the Southeast. Two people were killed in storm-related auto accidents in North Carolina. In South Carolina, a utility worker checking power lines was electrocuted Thursday, and another man was killed by a tornado that destroyed his mobile home near Greensburg, La., early Wednesday morning. The storm that swept through North Carolina was part of that system, Tom Bradshaw, a meteorologist with the Southern Regional Headquarters of the National Weather Service in Fort Worth, said. Kip Godwin, chairman of the Columbus County Board of Commissioners in North Carolina, said he had heard a report from an emergency worker about a child found in a ditch, still alive, who was taken to a local hospital. ''I don't think these folks had very much warning,'' Mr. Godwin said."
"The severe storm that carved a tightly focused path across Westchester County and a corner of Connecticut on Wednesday night, overturning cars, snapping trees, tearing roofs and damaging buildings, was not just a tornado, but also the most powerful one to ever hit the county, weather experts said Thursday. The storm -- not officially designated as a tornado until Thursday -- touched down in central Westchester about 4 p.m. Wednesday with winds that at times exceeded 150 miles per hour, making it stronger than many of the tornadoes that sweep through the Midwest. The powerful twister was only the eighth to hit Westchester since 1950. It reached a peak level of F2 on a scale of 0 to 5 as it headed east across the county into Connecticut, said Jeff Tongue of the National Weather Service's Long Island office. The tornado not only attained a ferocity that less than 10 percent of tornadoes reach -- the F2 level -- but also followed an unusual path. Most F2 tornadoes travel no more than half a mile; the one on Wednesday night, Mr. Tongue said, left a track across two states that extended for nearly 20 miles. ''We never see tornadoes that cross over an entire county,'' he said, speaking at a news conference here with the county executive, Andrew J. Spano. ''I believe this is the first F2 type damage ever documented in Westchester, and it is an extremely long-track tornado.'' The twister was so ferocious that it tore down thousands of trees, demolished buildings, and tossed a police cruiser that was sitting on Route 9A in Hawthorne into the air. The officer inside that car and three other people were treated for minor injuries in Westchester and had all been released from hospitals by Thursday afternoon. Officials said they were still clearing debris and restoring power to thousands of people. Nate Pringle, a truck driver who was on Route 9A on Wednesday night, said he spotted the tornado heading for the road and pulled over. A minute later, he said, his truck was picked up and flipped on its side near a gas station, where it came to rest just a few feet from a gas pump. ''I'm basically O.K.,'' he said. Most of the damage caused by the tornado was in Mount Pleasant, Hawthorne, North Castle and Sleepy Hollow in Westchester, and in Greenwich, Conn. As of Thursday afternoon, more than 2,000 people were still without power in those areas, utility officials said. Mr. Spano, the county executive, said he witnessed the storm's path from a helicopter on Thursday and estimated that the damage to homes and businesses was in the millions. Gov. George E. Pataki, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and federal officials contacted the county on Thursday and offered help in seeking financial assistance, Mr. Spano said. ''We have more damage than we expected,'' he said. ''But the remarkable thing about this is that trees fell on houses, they fell on cars, and yet no one was seriously hurt. ''For an F2 tornado, that's miraculous,'' he added. Although it wrought most of its devastation in Westchester, the tornado arose from warm tropical air and a strong jet stream over the eastern edge of Rockland County. It then traveled east across the Hudson River, appearing as a water spout over the water, and touched down in Mount Pleasant as an F1 tornado. But it gathered strength and reached its greatest intensity as it crossed the Pocantico Hills on the Rockefeller estate in Mount Pleasant, where it destroyed two small barns and dozens of trees, then continued east across the county to Connecticut."
"A reported tornado touched down in central Westchester County on Wednesday, heavily damaging a commercial building on Route 9A, knocking down trees and physically lifting a state trooper's car and twirling it around. The twister, first spotted crossing the Hudson River and described as looking like a water spout, touched down at least twice, according to reports made to the National Weather Service. It moved over the village of Sleepy Hollow, then into the town of Mount Pleasant, where it did the most damage in the hamlet of Hawthorne. It was in Hawthorne that the state trooper, who was driving on Route 9A, encountered the storm.. ''His car was picked up in the air and spun around,'' said Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County executive. The trooper, whose name was not released, was taken to Westchester Medical Center with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening, Mr. Spano said. No one else was seriously injured. On Route 9A, the two-story brick home of California Closets was damaged so badly that passers-bys could look into the building and out again onto a restaurant on the other side. Glass and shredded metal remained scattered on the roofs of cars in the parking lot, which were abandoned by the approximately 40 employees who had been evacuated. Inside the building, black wires drooped from the ceiling like industrial vines. A nearby preschool was evacuated, with 40 children and 15 staff members taken to the Westchester Police Academy. In parts of Westchester, snapped electrical wires were sparking in water puddles and, in some cases, creating small flames. The severe thunderstorms that accompanied the tornado also knocked out power to 4,000 residents in Westchester and 1,800 in Connecticut and parts of northern New Jersey. Metro-North Railroad service on the Harlem line between Valhalla and Hawthorne was disrupted after seven large trees toppled onto the tracks. Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for Metro-North, said no trains were stuck and no one was injured. Ms. Anders said the fallen trees were observed by train engineers beginning at 3:50 p.m., the same time that the National Weather Service started to field damage reports from a possible tornado. Throughout the area, the police closed roads where trees had fallen just before the afternoon rush, snarling traffic. All service on the Upper Harlem line was suspended until about 5 p.m., as crews with chains and chainsaws cleared the trees from the northbound track. Service resumed for northbound passengers, while about 15 buses were used to transport southbound passengers, Ms. Anders said. The tornado sightings came one day after another burst of wild weather in Westchester. On Tuesday, severe thunderstorms and high winds knocked down many trees in the town of New Castle, which is immediately north of Mount Pleasant. Several roads there were closed, including two major state routes. According to Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University, tornados are ''relatively rare'' in the Northeast. He said that tornados, which are spawned by intense thunderstorms, arise when there is wind shear, the phenomenon of winds changing speeds and direction with increasing altitude. However, just a few weeks ago, a tornado touched down in La Grange, in Dutchess County, damaging property but leaving no one injured. In November 1989, a powerful tornado elsewhere in the Hudson Valley killed nine schoolchildren when it blew in the wall of an elementary school in East Coldenham, in Orange County. On Wednesday afternoon, the National Weather Service issued a tornado warning for southern Westchester County and for Fairfield County in Connecticut, as well as a less urgent tornado watch across a much broader area, including New Jersey. Most of the warnings were lifted by the evening, but flood watches remained in effect overnight for northern New Jersey, southern Connecticut, and Rockland and Westchester Counties."
"EARLIER this month, Westchester County residents were visited by one of nature's most ferocious manifestations: a tornado. Most people in the county have never witnessed one of these monsters -- outside the occasional viewing of ''The Wizard of Oz.'' But on July 12, a funnel cloud formed over Grand View in Rockland County, crossed the Hudson River as a waterspout near the Tappan Zee Bridge, swept through Sleepy Hollow and still had enough punch at Hawthorne to flip over a police car before dissipating somewhere near Greenwich, Conn. Tornadoes develop about five times a year in New York State, but they normally frequent the state's southwest region, which is closer to the Midwest's tornado alley. Every two or three years, however, a tornado rips through the metropolitan area, bullying one burg or another. The National Weather Service said Westchester's recent tornado was at the low end of the Fujita scale, which rates tornadoes by the damage they cause on a progressive scale from F0 (weak) to F5 (devastating, with winds 261 to 318 miles per hour). Westchester has experienced several weak tornadoes in recent years, the most recent of which was a June 2000 twister that (barely) struck Cortlandt. The most powerful tornado to hit the county was an F3 (severe, with winds 158 to 206 m.p.h.) at Chappaqua, on July 16, 1904. According to one report, the storm killed one person, destroyed two farmhouses and five barns and ''carried a pair of pants two miles.'' As for New York City, an F3 barreled across Bergen County in New Jersey on July 13, 1895, killing three people near Hackensack before jumping off the Palisades, crossing the Hudson, and appearing briefly in Harlem. This was probably Manhattan's closest encounter with a major tornado since the arrival of Europeans. Is it conceivable that New York could one day be devastated by a powerful tornado? Yes, but the probability ranks somewhere around the odds of your winning next week's Lotto jackpot. Curiously, the biggest American cities seem to be immune from direct hits by major tornadoes. Chicago is in prime tornado country, yet the spinners seem to avoid the downtown as if the buildings were protected by kryptonite. Hollywood producers gleefully bring down nature's worst on the City of Angels. But Los Angeles, like New York, seems unlikely to experience the reality-show version of a twister. When extraordinary weather occurs these days, global warming is often the whipping boy. Although global warming may indeed contribute to an increase in some severe weather, including tropical storms, floods and heat waves, tornadoes thus far do not appear to be strengthened by higher temperatures. There has been no increase in the frequency or intensity of tornadoes in the past 20 years. Indeed, the United States has not experienced an F5 in seven years, the longest period without a monster tornado since reliable record-keeping began more than a century ago. Before that, however, several strong tornadoes did rake Queens and Brooklyn and outlying areas, including Westchester County in 1812. A powerful tornado struck Poughkeepsie in June 1794. The storm inspired the usual sense of awe and fright. But a local newspaper seemed to find meaning in the heavenly transport of one citizen. ''A lusty man,'' the paper reported, ''by the force of the wind was carried more than 60 feet in the air, and lodged against a stone wall and locust tree that joined it.'' Lusty men of Poughkeepsie, be forewarned. Op-Ed Contributor Christopher C. Burt is the author of ''Extreme Weather: A Guide and Record Book.''"
"As the search for survivors continued on Saturday, President Bush approved a declaration to provide federal aid to the four Central Florida counties where tornadoes left at least 20 dead and 1,500 homes severely damaged or destroyed. In a speech to Democratic members of Congress gathering in Virginia, Mr. Bush said he ''shares concerns for those whose lives were turned upside down by that storm,'' which hit Lake, Seminole, Sumter and Volusia Counties. ''Whatever federal response is needed,'' Mr. Bush said, ''we will make it quick and sure.'' R. David Paulison, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said tractor-trailer loads of tarps, blue sheeting, water, meals and generators, along with five mobile-assistance trailers were on their way to the area on Saturday. But by the end of the day none of the trailers had arrived, said Rich Nicorvo, spokesman for Lake County Emergency Services. Tornadoes touched down in the small communities north of Orlando at about 3 a.m. Friday. Many residents said their electricity had been out from about 10 p.m. to 2:30 a.m., and they went to bed unaware of the tornado watch that had been issued by the National Weather Service. The service issued warnings just minutes before the twisters hit. ''It makes you sick to your stomach to think about the people who have lost their lives, lost their homes and everything they own,'' Mr. Paulison said after viewing the damage from a military helicopter with Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida. As workers took down splintered, debris-filled oaks on Saturday, parishioners of the nearby Lady Lake Church of God sang hymns, holding hands and some hymnals they had recovered. The mood here was subdued and roads congested as power companies temporarily blocked lanes to replace lines and downed poles. The sound of power saws echoed from all directions in Lady Lake, a town of 13,500 that serves as a bedroom community to Orlando. More than 30 miles away, in the small rural neighborhood of Camp Mack, Robert Bissell picked through the debris at his 71-year-old mother's flattened home in search of some of her clothes and shoes. He said he had called F.E.M.A. earlier to register her for benefits. ''They answered the phone promptly, but they were not very forthcoming,'' Mr. Bissell said. ''They told me they would likely send someone out in less than 7 to 10 days. I would have liked to have heard more like 72 hours.'' Mr. Bissell's mother, Else Campbell, was at home when a tornado hit, but suffered no serious injuries. She is staying with a friend for a few days. Beyond that, Mr. Bissell said he did not know where she would go. The tornado in Camp Mack killed 14. Residents of the stricken counties searched for photographs and other belongings from their smashed homes, more than 1,500 of which were left uninhabitable. Despite the large number of displaced people, local shelters housed only 109 on Friday night, said Rubin Almaguer, deputy director of the Division of Florida Emergency Management. ''Most of these people stayed with friends and family,'' Mr. Almaguer said. Mr. Paulison said it was too early to know how many would need temporary housing. Those numbers will come from the state, he said. But in the meantime, every family displaced is eligible for $28,200 in federal assistance, which can be used to repair or replace their homes, or pay for medical assistance, rental housing or damage to their automobiles. Mr. Almaguer said that eventually F.E.M.A. housing would be necessary, but that it was too soon to tell how much. The storms also killed 18 endangered young whooping cranes that had been led south from Wisconsin last fall -- to a refuge near Crystal River, Fla. -- as part of a project to create a second migratory flock of the birds, The Associated Press reported."
"The members of the First Baptist Church here clapped enthusiastically after their minister and fellow parishioners played ''Turn, Turn, Turn,'' the 1960s hit song by the Byrds. It was a lyrical sermon that resonated with those affected by the tornadoes that took 13 lives in the Paisley area of Central Florida. ''A time to kill, and a time to heal, a time to break down, and a time to build up,'' the church's drummer sang as the minister, the Rev. John Roszak, played the electric bass. Mr. Roszak said he had fretted that the sermon would be a challenge but found the song's lyrics, which come directly from Ecclesiastes, fitting. ''For those who were lost, I would like to say 'hello' from heaven,'' Mr. Roszak said to applause from his congregation of about 150. About 10 miles west of the church, the community of Lake Mack was the hardest hit by the tornadoes that ripped through early Friday, killing 13 people within one square mile. The landscape where homes once stood was left a stew of branches, boards, glass and clothing amid a cemetery of scalped trees, their skeletons holding mattresses, insulation and tin. The tornadoes touched down in four counties, leaving a total of 20 dead, scores injured and more than 1,500 homes destroyed or uninhabitable. Nearly 1,200 of those homes were in the Villages, a newer retirement community more than 30 miles west of rural Lake Mack. A pocket of Lady Lake, which borders the Villages, was also hit hard, reporting seven deaths. Gov. Charlie Crist attended church services on Sunday with the congregation of Lady Lake Church of God outside what was once their house of worship but is now a mangled clump of steel, insulation, church pews, tree limbs and other debris. As some parishioners of First Baptist Church in Paisley sang and listened to music and the minister's words on Sunday morning, across the hall other church members prepared boxed lunches and organized food, clothing and toiletries donated by community residents. One of the church workers, Katlynn Grimes, 13, said she had lost her friend David Downing, who was killed along with his parents. She found out about his death from her school principal and said she had trouble accepting it. ''David was like a brother to me,'' Katlynn said. ''I cried Friday and Saturday, but not today, yet.'' Red-eyed and disheveled, Priscilla Smith and her mother, victims of the storm, nibbled on pizza as church workers brought out a gallon of sweet tea and boxes filled with food for them and their neighbors. ''A lot of people don't want to leave their place because they think someone might steal their stuff,'' Ms. Smith said, bracing her head with her hand as she leaned on the folding tables set up in the church's fellowship hall. ''My neighbor won't leave. His son isn't even talking. I had to make him go with me this morning so he could get a shower.'' Ms. Smith, who has lived on Lake Mack her entire life, said her family had fared better than most. The walls of their house are still standing, though the structure was moved from its foundation. The roof is gone, as is much of the furniture. Still, Ms. Smith said: ''My neighbor has nothing. He's staying out there in a makeshift shed. I was able to uncover an air mattress I had and gave it to him.'' Lake Mack Drive, a dead end, is tucked off a county road that borders the Ocala National Forest. About 200 people live around the lake that gives the community its name. Lots are one to three acres, and several neighbors had horses. A few chickens and a rooster still pecked for food in the wreckage on Sunday. Like much of Lake County, the area is populated by natives and an influx of retirees and commuters seeking the serenity of rural life. Deland is only 15 miles to the east, and Lady Lake, about 35 miles to the west. ''We're kind of like a bedroom community to a bedroom community,'' Mr. Roszak said. The tornado left a relatively small pocket of devastation amid otherwise untouched landscape. Less than a half mile from where victims picked through flattened wreckage, others enjoyed a normal Sunday afternoon. A teenager raced his dirt bike next to an untouched home. Music could be heard through open doors. Horses grazed underneath giant live oaks dripping with Spanish moss. Nevertheless, the entire community felt the storm's impact. At Forest Hills Store, where photos of hunters hang from the wall, residents talked of the tornadoes as they stood in line to buy six-packs. ''Are they letting you back there yet?'' Michael Farmer, a construction worker, asked. ''I lived back there until six months ago, and I still have friends there I want to help.'' The country store's clerk, S. M. Bari, who also lost a friend to the storm, said he had had a constant string of customers since the tornado, repair workers and residents coming in to buy supplies. Down Lake Mack Drive, Marilynn Fischer gazed over what was once her home. ''We don't know each other very well,'' Ms. Fischer said of her neighbors. ''But if we needed help they would come over. They did the other night.'' Two of her neighbors pulled her and her husband from the wreckage early Friday morning. She was in the bathtub, pinned under her husband, who was crushed beneath a washing machine. ''I still can't believe it,'' Ms. Fischer said. ''It still really hasn't sunk in. It probably won't sink in until after we get it all cleaned up.''"
"After the sudden pitch-black darkness, there was chaos, then screaming. And when that subsided, the students of Enterprise High School recalled on Friday, some young men and women they had grown up with were nowhere to be found, while others climbed shakily to their feet. Eight students were killed here on Thursday afternoon, quick victims of a tornado that tore apart their school soon after they were told to hit the floor. Concrete from a collapsed interior wall rained down on them as they huddled together for safety, the authorities said. Officials defended their decision not to evacuate the school earlier, saying the impending tornadoes would have made it too dangerous. On Friday, dazed survivors -- teachers and students -- recounted their luck as they toured the perimeter of the painful ruins, the building's spilled-out insides visible even from the great distance at which the authorities kept onlookers. For grief-stricken parents like those of Andrew J. Jackson, a sturdy 16-year-old cheerleader and weightlifter, there was no consolation in their bewilderment. ''We lost a good man yesterday,'' said Andrew's father, Tim Jackson, his lip trembling as he stood in the family carport. Mr. Jackson said witnesses had told him and his wife a heroic story of their son's last moments. Andrew held up a falling concrete beam long enough for another student to escape, they told him, and was then crushed by it. The tornado here was only the sharpest shard in huge storm system that produced at least 31 tornadoes on Thursday and battered the nation's midsection from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico, killing 10 in Alabama, 9 in Georgia and 1 in Missouri. In Georgia, six of those killed were residents of a trailer park in Newton, and at least two died in Sumter. ''I actually thought that this was the end, that, like, I was about to be taken away from earth,'' said Antoine Perry, 31, of Newton. Grief hung especially heavy over Enterprise, a hardscrabble, military-dominated town of 23,000 adjacent to Fort Rucker, just above the Florida Panhandle. It seemed as if everyone's son or daughter, or nephew or grandchild, had a story to tell. Great swaths of insulation jutted from the top of an accordioned central section of the high school. Cars were lifted nose first into the air. The search for bodies continued until after 1 a.m. Friday. ''You don't expect to take a child to school, then go back and pull him out of the rubble,'' said Maxie Searcy of Searcy's Funeral Home, where some of the relatives of the victims were headed. The Jacksons' agony had been prolonged over 12 hours of waiting. After the tornado, parents and students assembled in a dark church next to the school, and church officials called out the students' names. Parents awaited anxiously in the gloom for their child's name to be spoken, and for the longed-for response. When nobody responded to ''A. J. Jackson,'' Laura Jackson, Andrew's mother, said, she knew something was wrong. ''Oh, gosh, they probably called it out four times,'' Mrs. Jackson said. ''I knew, when he wasn't at the church, I knew he was trapped.'' It was not until hours later that they got word. ''He would have helped anybody he could,'' said his father, who owns a car wash. Neither parent wondered about what they had been told. ''Even knowing the outcome, he would do it again,'' Mrs. Jackson said. ''For Andrew not to survive, it must have been bad. He was strong as an ox.'' In the carport, the Jacksons embraced each other and their surviving child, a daughter, April. Relatives arrived to comfort them. There was too much grief just yet for any criticism of school officials for failing to clear the school before the tornado hit at 1:15, despite hours of weather warnings. Some parents had pulled out their children anyway, a few said. When the tornado hit, students and teachers ''were sitting on the floor in the fetal position, kind of up against the wall,'' said Sheriff Dave Sutton of Coffee County. The hallways had been considered the safest place, but an interior wall collapsed, ''and a lot of concrete came down on them,'' the sheriff said. Like other officials here, the sheriff lauded the response and said the school's disaster plan had been properly put into effect. Gov. Bob Riley descended into the ruins by helicopter Friday morning, praised the military and local officials, and spoke of the outpouring for the bereaved from across the country. ''This country is praying for them,'' Mr. Riley said. Squads of soldiers and police officers were deployed on the streets, stopping cars and challenging onlookers. Traffic was backed up for blocks. In Washington, President Bush announced plans to visit the region on Saturday. ''Looking back,'' said Bob Pares, the assistant superintendent of schools, ''we would not have evacuated any sooner. ''There was one warning after another, after 10:30 a.m.,'' Mr. Phares said. ''We didn't want to send the students out in the middle of a tornado.'' In the end, the tornado came to get them. ''It was like hell, it was so dark,'' said Kevin Smith, an 11th grader. ''I heard people screaming. Everybody was very, very scared.'' Jim McClellan, a special-education teacher, said: ''I kept saying, 'We're going to be all right, we're going to be all right,' and frankly not believing a word of it. ''At the time, I heard screams from every direction, including the two I was holding onto. And I saw a lot of blood.'' Many recalled how short the interruption was. ''I pretty much watched it lift the roofs of houses across the street, and then I saw it lift cars in the air,'' said Josh Beene, a cousin of Andrew Jackson. ''Then I pretty much tucked my head under and protected myself,'' Mr. Beene said. . ''Then in five seconds, it was over, and the roof was gone, and the lights were hanging from the ceiling. And then everybody was screaming.'' Storms Pummel Midwest MINNEAPOLIS, March 2 (AP) -- Fierce winds blew snow across roads and stranded hundreds of drivers on highways in the Midwest on Friday, as thousands of homes and business were without power and airlines canceled hundreds of flights. The storm system brought more than a foot of snow to some areas, and even though the flakes had stopped falling by afternoon, gusts of wind at 40 miles per hour prompted blizzard warnings and prevented major highways from reopening. The system was blamed for nine deaths since Wednesday, eight related to traffic accidents. The governors of Iowa and South Dakota issued disaster declarations."
"President Bush picked his way through the rubble of the tornado-stricken South on Saturday, promising federal aid for some Alabamians and turning up unexpectedly in a largely African-American neighborhood here in Georgia, where startled residents rushed out of their damaged houses, cell phone cameras in hand, to greet him. The hastily arranged trip, following a massive storm system that produced at least 31 tornadoes from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico, was intended to send an image of a compassionate president leading a competent government response, in sharp contrast with the lingering images of federal indifference and ineptitude after Hurricane Katrina. The president's day began in Enterprise, Ala., where eight students were killed as a tornado on Thursday ripped apart Enterprise High School. Mr. Bush, accompanied by Mayor Kenneth Boswell and several student leaders, made his way through a destroyed wing of the school, stopping in the hallway, where raining chunks of metal and concrete cost the students their lives. ''Out of this rubble will emerge a better tomorrow,'' the president said afterward, his hands resting gently on the shoulders of the 17-year-old student government president, Megan Parks. He called the scene one of ''devastation that's hard to believe,'' adding, ''The biggest effect of the storm is the shattered lives.'' Ms. Parks, clearly shaken, bit her lip and wiped away tears as Mr. Bush spoke. She had left school 30 minutes before the storm hit, stopping along the way to pick up her little brother from elementary school to take him home. Saturday was her first time back. ''It's so hard to see our school like this,'' she said. The president declared Coffee County, which encompasses Enterprise, a federal disaster area. The designation allows affected households to receive up to $28,200 in aid, according to R. David Paulison, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who accompanied Mr. Bush on the trip. Mr. Paulison said he had worked through the night preparing paperwork for the disaster declaration, which Mr. Bush approved aboard Air Force One on Saturday morning. White House officials said a similar declaration for Georgia was being considered. After the Enterprise visit, Mr. Bush took an hour-long helicopter ride to hard-hit Americus, south of Atlanta, where his published schedule listed only a briefing here by local officials in the parking lot of a damaged hospital. Instead, the president's motorcade drove straight to a modest neighborhood of faded clapboard homes, stopping at a duplex where two people had died seeking shelter from the storm. As Mr. Bush made his way from house to house to shake hands, giddy residents thrust their cell phones at him, imploring him to stop for pictures and, in some cases, to talk to boyfriends or girlfriends on the other end of the line. Laughing, he obliged. It was a striking post-Katrina image for a president whose standing among black voters -- never very high to begin with -- fell even lower after the hurricane. ''He's lifting spirits in a very difficult situation,'' said Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, who accompanied Mr. Bush. One person whose spirits appeared lifted was Felicia Stafford, who said the tornado had blown the roof off her house and ruined its wood floors. ''He's very nice, loving and warm,'' she said after meeting Mr. Bush. ''He's got very soft hands.''"
"IT'S finally business as usual for some businesses on Route 9A, more than nine months after the most powerful tornado in the county's history tore through the area. The July 12 twister, identified as a powerful F2 -- on a scale of 0 to 5 -- hit the hamlet hard, lifting a police car off the ground and damaging several businesses, including three restaurants on Route 9: Applebee's, the Oriental Diner and Tramonto. But it was a California Closets that fared the worst, sustaining what Laressa Gjonaj, a marketing director, described as millions of dollars in damage -- including a collapsed roof and extensive water damage when the sprinkler system activated. Fortunately, no one was hurt. California Closets moved from its two-story brick building to a temporary site several doors away. Employees were forced to share offices in the rental space, which was lacking in other departments as well. ''There was no showroom, so we couldn't actually show people our products,'' Ms. Gjonaj said. California Closets returned in January to its 55,000-square-foot building, which has a showroom, a warehouse and an office. Customer traffic is also back to pretornado levels. ''Route 9A is pretty busy,'' Ms. Gjonaj said, ''so once people saw cars in our parking lot, they started coming in.'' While many fallen trees still line Route 9A, things are returning to normal across the street at Tramonto. The Italian restaurant closed for about 24 hours after the tornado destroyed its sign, smashed outdoor tables and chairs, ripped out dining room tiles and sent trees crashing across the parking lot. But the storm's timing was fortuitous; it struck between lunch and dinner, when there were no customers and just a handful of employees' cars in the lot. Michela Santucci, a co-owner, estimated that the cost of the damage, including food that had to be thrown out, came to about $70,000. The sign on the front lawn has yet to be replaced, but Tramonto has a new coat of paint, and its lunch and dinner business is steady. ''We're just happy no one got hurt,'' Ms. Santucci said. UPDATE"
"The tornado that ripped through this southwest Georgia town Thursday not only left a trail of death and devastation, it also stripped bare the only major medical facilities for thousands of people in a sprawling rural community. The storm, which killed two people here, tore apart buildings and unearthed 100-year-old oak trees, left this town of nearly 17,000 and the outlying area without a hospital or clinic that could handle emergencies. ''We are without a hospital right now, and that's not good,'' said Brent Williams, a Sumter County commissioner. ''We are a community without close medical care, and that is a concern we all have because we are not prepared at any time to say, 'I'll just put off all my medical needs for an extensive period of time.' '' The storm left the area's only hospital, the 143-bed Sumter Regional Hospital, a shell of a building. The tornado also hit a row of doctors' offices and wiped out the newly opened Sumter HealthPlex, an 8,000-square-foot, $3.1 million facility owned by the hospital. The HealthPlex had offered X-rays and laboratory services and had been widely used by the community, said David Seagraves, the president and chief executive of Sumter Regional Hospital. Immediately after the storm, about 55 patients, including women in labor and newborns, were transferred to facilities in three neighboring counties. Doctors and nurses set up a makeshift clinic at the Americus First Baptist Church, providing insulin to diabetics and care to residents hurt in storm cleanup. Mr. Seagraves said parts of the hospital had such severe structural damage that they might not be rebuilt. But he said the hospital should be able to rebuild its emergency department and would focus on that. ''We consider that to be our first priority in terms of returning patient care to a higher level in the community,'' Mr. Seagraves said. ''We don't want to go an extended period of time without being able to provide a full complement of services to our community, but we will be hard pressed to do that in a very quick nature because of the extent of damage to our facilities.'' Dr. Beverly Womick, an obstetrician and gynecologist, said about 900 babies were delivered annually at Sumter Regional Hospital, including those of many migrant farm workers in southwest Georgia. ''There is no other hospital for 50 miles that can handle the volume of deliveries that we do,'' Dr. Womick said. Dr. Womick's office was not damaged in the storm, and she said she would be able to see patients there once the power was restored. But deliveries and surgeries will be moved to Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital in Albany, about 40 miles away. The hospital has agreed to give Dr. Womick and other obstetricians at Sumter Regional Hospital staff privileges. ''Albany is really saving us,'' Dr. Womick said. The hospital had been planning to expand its HealthPlex building to add a wellness center, offering things like seminars on nutrition and an indoor track. ''Our community was really giving it high praise,'' Mr. Seagraves said. ''It's a total loss. We'll probably have to scrape it down to the slab and start again.''"
"A storm system that stretched nearly 1,000 miles from the Midwest to the Southeast on Thursday killed at least 11 people in three states, including five who died when what appeared to be a tornado caused the roof to collapse at a high school in Enterprise, Ala., state emergency management officials said. Two other people were killed in Alabama, three in Georgia and one in Missouri. Some students remained unaccounted for late Thursday and could be trapped inside the building, said Larry Walker, deputy director of the Emergency Management Agency in Coffee County, in southeastern Alabama. Students at Enterprise High School had just been ordered to take cover in hallways when fierce winds bore down at 1 p.m., plunging them into darkness and pounding them with falling debris. ''The ceiling part fell on us and rocks hit me on the back,'' said Ezekiel Jones, 17, a senior who was in the gym when the apparent tornado struck. ''I was thinking of my mom, my girlfriend, my sister and my friends. Everybody was screaming.'' Steven Carter, 16, a junior, said he was in the science wing when the lights went out. ''It happened fast,'' Steven said. ''There wasn't much warning.'' He said he could smell methane leaking from the Bunsen burners in the classrooms. ''A lot of kids were trapped,'' Steven said. Steven said he saw science teachers tending to some of the wounded with first-aid kits salvaged from the wrecked classrooms. Toni J. Kaminski, a spokeswoman for Medical Center Enterprise, said the hospital treated 50 to 60 people. ''We have seen a myriad of injuries, including a ruptured spleen, head trauma, chest trauma, broken bones,'' Ms. Kaminski said. Though the high school seems to have taken a direct hit, neighborhoods throughout Enterprise reported extensive damage. Jeanne Davis, 55, a clerk at nearby Fort Rucker Army Base, said she rushed home after the winds stopped to find shingles torn off her roof and a two-by-four driven into the ground in her front yard. Throughout Enterprise, which has a population of about 21,000 people, cars were upended, trees were snapped and homes flattened, with other reports of injuries coming from the downtown area. A state emergency management spokeswoman, Yasamie Richardson, said that five people had been killed at the high school and that one other person in Enterprise was also killed. Seth Hammett, speaker of the Alabama House, said one person died in Millers Ferry, about 80 miles northwest of Enterprise, where 12 to 15 trailer homes had been destroyed. Because of confusion at the school scene, emergency management officials initially said 15 had died there. Thursday night they were still trying to assess the damage across the state, . and Gov. Bob Riley declared a state of emergency. In Georgia, the storms killed at least three people and caused an unknown number of injuries, Reuters reported, quoting Buzz Weiss, spokesman for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency. Two were killed in Americus, Ga., when the Sumter Regional Hospital was hit by what appeared to be a tornado, Mr. Weiss said. In Missouri, a 7-year-old girl was killed and four members of her family were injured when a tornado flattened their mobile home near West Plains, at 7 a.m., said Sheriff Robbie Crites of Howell County."
"The tornado that suddenly destroyed Greensburg, Kan., earlier this month was another reminder of why Americans need to be concerned that so much of the National Guard and its equipment is now deployed far from home -- in Iraq, Afghanistan and along the Mexican border. Fortunately, Kansas still had enough Guard members for rescue and cleanup in a town of less than 2,000 people. But if the next disaster is a Category 5 hurricane, a terrorist attack or a nationwide flu epidemic, we fear the Guard will not be ready. Congress needs to speed its efforts to rebuild the Guard's capacity. While more federal money cannot bring Guard members back home, it can accelerate the replacement of lost equipment and pay for disaster response training. The National Guard is America's primary first response force. It can be mobilized quickly. It is under the command of state governors. And unlike federal military forces, which are not supposed to engage in local law enforcement, it can step in smoothly where needed to preserve public order. But because the Army is so overstretched, more than 25,000 National Guard troops are now serving in Iraq, and that number is expected to rise significantly as part of President Bush's troop buildup. Nearly 5,000 are in Afghanistan and roughly 6,000 are stationed along the Mexican border. Because of equipment left behind in Iraq and Afghanistan, domestically based Guard units have only 40 percent of the equipment they need for disaster response. Nearly 90 percent of stateside Guard units are rated less than fully ready because of equipment and training shortfalls. In the days immediately after 9/11, Air National Guard fighter jets provided extra air cover over New York, and units from the District of Columbia National Guard helped out in Washington. But that was before Iraq. When Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in 2005, roughly 35 percent of the Louisiana National Guard, and 40 percent of the Mississippi contingent, were in Iraq. Federal troops and Guard units from other states helped fill the gap. But it's not hard to imagine situations where waiting for out-of-state responders will cost lives, particularly if a disaster also hits neighboring states. In a year when Congress will be authorizing more than half a trillion dollars in national security spending, there is no excuse for keeping the National Guard on perilously short rations. Editorial"
"With memories of his administration's flat-footed response to Hurricane Katrina still lingering, President Bush visited a tornado-wrecked patch of Kansas on Wednesday to pledge administration vigilance in recovery efforts. The visit seemed to have a dual purpose: to deliver an in-person pledge of support for the town of Greensburg, and to dispel any comparisons to the hurricane response, one day after his administration sparred with Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas over disaster readiness. The governor was at his side as he toured the wreckage. ''Our role as government officials is to work with the states and local folks to get whatever help is appropriate here,'' Mr. Bush said. Speaking to reporters separately, Ms. Sebelius, a Democrat, said, ''There will be money -- federal, state, local,'' adding, ''We have an opportunity to rebuild a real American town.'' Behind the scenes, tension remained. On the way to Kansas aboard Air Force One, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, R. David Paulison, was sent to the press cabin to refute the notion that the response in Kansas was anything less than swift and thorough. ''I've asked probably at least 20 times, Is there anything that you need you don't have?'' Mr. Paulison said. ''The answer is no. The response in this particular case was absolutely phenomenal.'' And officials pointed to positive reviews across the state, including one from Earl Liggett, Kiowa County commissioner, who, referring to the hurricane response, said in an interview: ''I think FEMA was left with some egg on its face there, and they're going to make sure it doesn't happen here, and it hasn't. It's been an unbelievable response.'' But FEMA's response was never at issue in the dispute with Kansas officials. Ms. Sebelius had criticized the shortages of equipment for the local National Guard, which she linked to its heavy deployment in Iraq. She did not repeat that criticism on Wednesday. She said the response had been ''prompt and good,'' and she added, ''We have a lot of assets here now.'' A bit later, one of Ms. Sebelius's aides said the governor's concern was not about the initial response, but the rebuilding ahead. ''It's the ongoing recovery effort that may be hampered,'' the aide said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he did not want to upstage the governor. ''After Air Force One leaves, we've still got work to do.'' Tony Snow, the White House spokesman, said that if state officials determined they were ill-equipped, ''they'll get what they need, period.'' For his part, Mr. Bush stuck to tending to those struggling to recover, according to a pool report, surveying the damage first from above, aboard Marine One, his helicopter, and then on the ground. Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, a Republican presidential contender, rode the helicopter with Mr. Bush, and when asked about Mr. Bush's reaction, said, ''Pretty devastating.'' Later, standing amid the wreckage on Bay Street, Mr. Bush said: ''My mission is to -- today, though, is to lift people's spirits as best as I possibly can and to hopefully touch somebody's soul by representing our country, and to let people know that while there was a dark day in the past, there's brighter days ahead.''"
"For months, Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas and other governors have warned that their state National Guards are ill-prepared for the next local disaster, be it a tornado a flash flood or a terrorist's threat, because of large deployments of their soldiers and equipment in Iraq and Afghanistan. Then, last Friday night, a deadly tornado all but cleared the small town of Greensburg off the Kansas map. With 80 square blocks of the small farming town destroyed, Ms. Sebelius said her fears had come true: The emergency response was too slow, she said, and there was only one reason. ''As you travel around Greensburg, you'll see that city and county trucks have been destroyed,'' Ms. Sebelius, a Democrat, said Monday. ''The National Guard is one of our first responders. They don't have the equipment they need to come in, and it just makes it that much slower.'' For nearly two days after the storm, there was an unmistakable emptiness in Greensburg, a lack of heavy machinery and an army of responders. By Sunday afternoon, more than a day and a half after the tornado, only about half of the Guard troops who would ultimately respond were in place. It was not until Sunday night that significant numbers of military vehicles started to arrive, many streaming in a long caravan from Wichita about 100 miles away. Ms. Sebelius's comments about the slow response prompted a debate with the White House on Tuesday, which initially said the fault rested with her. Tony Snow, the White House press secretary, said the governor should have followed procedure by finding gaps after the storm hit and asking the federal government to fill them -- but did not. ''If you don't request it, you're not going to get it,'' Mr. Snow told reporters on Tuesday morning. The debate was reminiscent of the Bush administration's skirmishes with Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana, also a Democrat, after Hurricane Katrina. But after an angry flurry of words, both sides seemed to back down a bit later Tuesday. Ms. Sibelius said she now had enough equipment and personnel to deal with the problems in Greensburg, and the White House acknowledged that the governor had requested several items that the federal government supplied, including a mobile command center, a mobile office building, an urban search and rescue team, and coordination of extra Black Hawk helicopters. Nonetheless, the governor and officials in other states again expressed concern that the problem could occur again as the stretched National Guard system struggled to respond to disasters at home while also fighting overseas. As State Senator Donald Betts Jr., Democrat of Wichita, put it: ''We should have had National Guard troops there right after the tornado hit, securing the place, pulling up debris, to make sure that if there was still life, people could have been saved. The response time was too slow, and it's becoming a trend. We saw this after Katrina, and it's like history repeating itself.'' The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which came under strong criticism after Hurricane Katrina, seemed to respond more quickly in Kansas. Several of the agency's mobile disaster recovery centers are in Greensburg assisting residents, and the agency said it had moved in 15,000 gallons of water and 21,000 ready-to-eat meals, enough to feed 10,000 people. State officials said the problem with the National Guard's response had more to do with equipment than personnel. In Kansas, the National Guard is operating with 40 percent to 50 percent of its vehicles and heavy machinery, local Guard officials said. Ordinarily, the Guard would have about 660 Humvees and more than 30 large trucks to traverse difficult terrain and transport heavy equipment. When the tornado struck, the Guard had about 350 Humvees and 15 large trucks, said Maj. Gen. Tod Bunting, the state's adjutant general. The Guard would also usually have 170 medium-scale tactical vehicles used to transport people and supplies -- but now it has fewer than 30, he said. On the other hand, General Bunting said, it had more cargo trucks than it needed. The issue is not confined to Kansas. In Ohio, the National Guard is short of night vision goggles and M-4 rifles, said a Guard spokesman, Dr. Mark Wayda. ''If we had a tornado hit a small town, we would be fine,'' Dr. Wayda said. ''If we had a much larger event, that would become a problem.'' The California National Guard is similarly concerned about a catastrophic event. ''Our issue is that we are shortchanged when it comes to equipment,'' said Col. Jon Siepmann, a spokesman for the Guard in California. ''We have gone from a strategic reserve to a globally deployable force, and yet our equipment resources have been largely the same levels since before the war.'' In Arkansas, Gov. Mike Beebe a Democrat, echoed the concerns of Ms. Sebelius. ''We have the same problem,'' Mr. Beebe said. ''We have had a significant decrease in equipment traditionally afforded our National Guard, and it's occasioned by the fact that it's been sent to the Middle East and Iraq.'' He added: ''Our first and foremost consideration is to guarantee that our soldiers have the resources, including equipment, to do the job and protect themselves. Having said that, my preference would be for the federal government to provide that equipment and not strip the state's resources, which could adversely impact the state's mission in times of crisis, which is what happened in Kansas.'' Last year, all 50 governors signed a letter to President Bush asking for the immediate re-equipping of Guard units sent overseas. But officials in several states, including Kentucky, Minnesota and Texas, said Tuesday that they were not facing equipment shortages. National Guard units overseas are often assigned engineering missions, and the skills and equipment -- bulldozers and trucks, for example -- are also what might be required to deal with a natural disaster at home. White House officials said that the Kansas National Guard had at its disposal in the Midwest and the Plains states, everything it needed. By Mr. Snow's count, that included 83,000 National Guard soldiers; 99 bulldozers; 61 loaders; 246 dump trucks and 59 graders. ''There's a lot of stuff available,'' Mr. Snow said. ''So, again, I think this is one where the equipment was available and everybody was moving as rapidly as possible.'' In Congressional testimony, senior National Guard officials have said that since Sept. 11 units under their command had equipment shortages as forces deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Responding to concerns that the National Guard would not have sufficient personnel or equipment to respond to natural disasters, Guard leaders and state officials developed plans to ensure that if a state is in short supply of people or gear when a hurricane or tornado strikes, it can borrow from other states. But borrowing does not solve every problem, state officials said, and coordination can take time. The destruction from Hurricane Katrina ultimately required the help of 50,000 troops -- and they came from all 50 states. Training is another issue. At a Washington news conference in February, Ms. Sebelius said, ''The Guard cannot train on equipment they do not have.'' She added later: ''And in a state like Kansas, where tornados, floods, blizzards and wildfires can seemingly happen all at once, we need our Guardsmen to be as prepared as possible.'' Two recent reports have raised questions about Guard preparedness. An independent military assessment council, the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves, released a report in March that stated: ''In particular, the equipment readiness of the Army National Guard is unacceptable and has reduced the capability of the United States to respond to current and additional major contingencies, foreign and domestic.'' Another report, released in January by the Government Accountability Office, concluded that the ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have ''significantly decreased'' the amount of equipment available for National Guard units not deployed overseas, while the same units face an increasing number of threats at home. Late Tuesday, in a statement, Ms. Sebelius repeated her message: ''I have said for nearly two years, and will continue to say, that we have a looming crisis on our hands when it comes to National Guard equipment in Iraq and our needs here at home.''"
"The crows awoke on Sunday to an all but lifeless landscape in this farming town on the rolling plains, cawing from denuded trees into the silent rubble field below. There was nobody except some emergency workers to hear them. There were no leaves on the trees to hide them. And as far as the eye could see, there were no buildings -- but for the grain elevator -- left to muffle their cries. Friday night's monster tornado, over a mile wide, was so efficient it looked as though a giant hammer had smashed Greensburg, population formerly 1,500. For perhaps 80 square blocks, old brick buildings and new frame ones were flattened into twisted piles of masonry and timbers. Attics tipped to the street, upstairs bathrooms were open to the sky, roofs were flush with the ground, and cars perched precariously on heaps of debris. The town on Sunday was a vast field of destruction. Every structure that had not been crushed had been opened to the street. Collapsed buildings immodestly displayed their girders and stuffing. Virtually every window, where window frames remained, had been shattered. Churches and gas stations could only vaguely be discerned, the high school's roof and much of the rest of it was gone, a paint store displayed its wares to the heavens, and the groceries at the supermarket were illuminated by a jagged tear in the roof. In a muddy field, a mortuary's open coffins lay tossed about, and large trucks lay upside down like giant beetles. Trees, festooned with insulation, were reduced to ugly brownish trunks, a shock against the delicate spring green of the surrounding fields. Old war photographs came to mind. ''You can see, in the distance, there's nothing,'' said Ronald Knoefel, a Kansas highway patrolman. ''Look around -- where do you start? Tell us which pile to look under.'' The death toll stood at eight, many people were injured, and on Sunday cadaver dogs continued to search the ruins. Police, fearful of looters, shooed away the few residents who had sneaked back in. Four soldiers from Fort Riley and a reserve police officer were arrested on Sunday on suspicion of looting cigarettes and alcohol from a store, The Associated Press reported. On Saturday, several other tornadoes, not as deadly, struck southwestern Kansas, and on Sunday the ruins here were periodically drenched with rain. Survivors who had gathered outside Greensburg said they had plenty of warning to flee to basements; sirens sounded for perhaps 20 minutes Friday night. Basements in many cases were smothered in rubble. Survivors told tales of clawing their way into the darkness after the tornado had passed, only to find nothing: no house, and no town. Even emergency officials expressed shock at the extent of the devastation, though many of them were veterans of other disasters. ''Normally, it will take out one area,'' said Dick Hainje, regional administrator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ''In this case, it's very nearly total destruction. It's catastrophic.'' For those who had lived in this slumbering community of wheat and corn farmers all their lives, the shock was complete -- like the sudden death of the vigorous head of a household. The town was like dozens of others and nonetheless content for that: it had its giant grain elevator, its funky museum complete with dusty meteorite, its Victorian houses, its locally-celebrated ''hand-dug well'' and its beloved high school football team. ''There's nothing left. It's the end of the world,'' said the county clerk, Evelyn Grimm, gamely trying to salvage vital records in the flooded basement of the shattered brick courthouse. ''All of the things you've lived with, all your life, they're just not there.'' Ms. Grimm's words were matter of fact, but the tone was tearful. ''I mean look, we don't even have a skyline,'' she said. ''About that quick, everything you've valued forever is gone.'' The city administrator, Steve Hewitt, rode out the twister in his basement with his small son. After the tornado, Mr. Hewitt said he ''went upstairs'' only to find ''there was no upstairs.'' On Sunday, he was hurrying from meeting to meeting with emergency officials in a makeshift village of trailers in the courthouse parking lot. ''What's most shocking, it's the entire town that has been destroyed,'' Mr. Hewitt said. ''A lot of folks don't really understand that. One hundred percent of everybody's possessions is gone. There's nothing to recover.'' This grim reality had barely begun to sink in 10 miles away in Haviland, where much of Greensburg's population was taken. Storm survivors milled in and out of the high school in Haviland on Sunday, still dazed. Mr. Hewitt spoke of rebuilding the town, but most people were concentrating on what seemed lucky tales of survival, and meeting with insurance adjusters. ''My husband said, 'Start praying,' '' as the tornado roared overhead, recalled Rhonda Engleken, who huddled with neighbors in the basement. When she emerged, her neighbor's deep freezer sat across the top of the stairs, and her house was gone. Later, she discovered the beauty parlor she ran downtown had been destroyed, too. Harold Schinstock, hunkered in his bathroom, looked up to find ''the ceiling was laying all around, and I could see the sky, and lightning.'' An interior stairwell saved the day for Darol Hess. ''If it hadn't been for that stairwell, we wouldn't be here today,'' Mr. Hess said. ''The stucco, the gravel, everything was coming at us. We had to dig it off of us.'' Sandy Foster said her ''beautiful 100-year-old Victorian home'' had collapsed as she hid in her basement with her daughters and their babies. ''Our house was lifted up, and the floor just fell into the basement,'' she said. Only one wall was left standing, and the second story of the house was in the front yard. Covered with dirt and dust, Ms. Foster and her family clawed their way through a narrow opening, passing the frightened children out and suffering scratches, only to learn that a next-door neighbor had been killed. ''That part, that doesn't seem real,'' Ms. Foster said."
"AT least the meteorite survived. ''The world's largest pallasite meteorite,'' that is, or so it is claimed. ''The world's largest hand-dug well'' survived too, although it was smothered with debris by the tornado that walloped Greensburg, Kan., a little over a week ago. These are a small town's treasures. They are the tourist lures, perhaps, but also the things that give a place its soul, its communal identity. And Greensburg -- meteorite and Big Well notwithstanding -- saw almost all of its town touchstones flattened by the fierce winds that killed 10 people and decimated nearly everything above ground. Hunter Drugs is gone, with its ruffled blue-and-white fringe of an awning, its walnut and marble booths, its red leatherette and chrome stools perched before the old-fashioned soda fountain. So is the Twilight Theater, with its pressed-tin ceilings that date from the time it showed silent pictures. And no cowboys or anyone else can shop at the Cowboy Supply store, with its giant sign outside in the shape of a Stetson-topped wrangler and the words ''Howdy Podner, Come In.'' The devastation leaves Greensburg, population 1,500, shadowed by a colossal question mark: When a thriving community cataclysmically finds itself reduced to rubble, how can it put itself back together? Many towns -- floodstruck or tumbled by tornadoes or hurricanes -- have wrestled with that question, and there is no single solution. But people who have been through it, as well as experts in town planning and disaster recovery, say there are pitfalls and priorities, and many things a place like Greensburg should keep in mind: How historically or culturally significant were the buildings? What is the town's economic engine? Where do people work? How young or old is the population? Is there a visionary leader? ''In some communities people may be much more comfortable just putting things back together the way they were, and in some cases they may want to embark on a totally new direction,'' said James Schwab, a senior research associate for the American Planning Association, who is considered a guru of disaster recovery. Take Stockton, Mo., an Ozarks town of about 2,000 that calls itself ''the black walnut capital of the world.'' When Stockton got socked by a tornado in 2003, it essentially reinvented itself. Stockton's epicenter had been a simple intersection of two highways, but now it is a town square, with roads that curve around a town center, with grass and flowers at each corner, said the mayor, Ralph Steele. Wood-frame buildings were replaced with steel and brick structures, and several businessmen built bigger shops -- Lester Johnson doubled the number of bays in his auto-body shop, and Aubrey Foster replaced his small restaurant and separate liquor store with a larger building that houses both. The Hammons Black Walnut Emporium was created, ''kind of like a Starbuck, you know what that is?'' Mayor Steele said. ''But it's even bigger and better than a Starbuck because they have a lot of gifts, candy and nuts, and even a bookstore.'' There were some nods to the past. The country's only black-walnut processing plant remained, even though some of the largest trees were gone. The century-old community center, where people quilt and play Ozarks music, was resurrected, even though meeting guidelines for historic buildings was expensive, the mayor said. ''One of my best friends is a judge who has lived here all his life,'' the mayor said, ''and he told me if I didn't rebuild the community center he would put me in jail.'' Otherwise, ''it looked like a new town to everybody,'' he said, adding that a memorial was built in a park to ''remember the tragedy, but that's all they need -- they don't want to relive it.'' History played a more critical role in Princeville, N.C., the country's first community chartered by African-Americans. Princeville was routed by a flood after Hurricane Floyd in 1999. Sam Knight, Princeville's town manager, said the first question was whether to relocate the community out of its vulnerable flood plain. The town council was evenly divided, but the mayor broke the tie, siding with the large elderly population, who are active voters, and who felt, Mr. Knight said: ''This is our land. We don't want to go anywhere else.'' Princeville decided to restore historic Mount Zion Church, even though ''it would probably have been easier to tear it down'' and build something new, Mr. Knight said. The old town hall building is also being restored, to become a museum and welcome center. Many towns rebuild with attention to safety or modern convenience, and Princeville did require every rebuilt house to have central heating and air-conditioning. Mr. Knight said the town wanted to rebuild its wood-frame houses in the original style, but that was too expensive, so most homes now have aluminum siding or brick. But two houses, which belonged to some of the town's first leaders, remain unlivable because Princeville is hoping to raise the money to restore them. David Godschalk, a professor emeritus of urban planning at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, says there is often tension between the ''real urge to get back to normal -- we don't want to wait'' and the recommendation from experts like himself that ''if you take some time, you can make it better.'' In Utica, Ill., hit by a tornado in 2004, at least one house was reconstructed on its original plot, even though it was in the path of a proposed new road and ''is going to have to be torn down,'' said John Paige, a planner assigned by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assist Utica. ''I think the people that want to take a deliberate approach are the minority.'' Arkadelphia, Ark., took a deliberate approach when a tornado clobbered it in 1997, appointing a commission of prominent residents and getting advice from architecture graduate students. Ultimately parts of the town look more old-fashioned than before, not more modern, said Joe Nix, a retired professor who was on the commission. ''I remember us reviewing old pictures of downtown and saying we wish we could make it just like it was in 1930,'' Mr. Nix said. Arkadelphia did not go that far, but an 1899 courthouse was restored, and some buildings with siding were renovated to reveal their old brick. And Malone's pharmacy, which had ''looked like a mini-Wal-Mart'' was rebuilt ''with an old soda fountain and a nice little restaurant that made it like an old-fashioned drugstore,'' Mr. Nix said, adding that the redevelopment ''made Arkadelphia more viable than a lot of other Arkansas downtowns.'' In Greensburg, the prognosis is unclear, said Denise Unruh, executive director of the South Central Community Foundation, a local organization that has already established a rebuilding fund for the town. The sizeable elderly population is divided on whether to stay or move ''closer to their children, who don't live here any longer,'' Ms. Unruh said. ''My closest friend, who had an incredibly beautiful historic home, said she will probably move to where her daughter is.'' People who worked at Dillon's grocery store or the hardware store ''will have to find jobs, and if we don't get that up and running right away they may go somewhere else,'' she said. There are signs of a future. The John Deere dealership is expected to stay, schools are expected to rebuild, and the hospital, a big employer, will most likely come back in some form, she said. But the futureof Hunter Drugs is uncertain, she said, and may depend on its legendary soda jerk, Dick Huckriede, who has made ''the best cherry cokes'' since 1952. ''I don't know what his family resources are to know if he will stay in town,'' Ms. Unruh said, ''but it would be hard for the drugstore to be the same if he wasn't there.''. Ms. Unruh envisions fusing Greensburg's old spirit with modern technology and construction, where people ''won't have to come to Greensburg and have a house built in 1902 with no closets and doorways that are 5-foot-8. People will be able to find what they find in a city, but yet have the rural flavor. It could be the community of the future.'' THE NATION"
"What grass remains from the fiercest tornado ever to strike Maryland is dappled with shards of glass and shredded asphalt shingles. Like a giant black boot, the twister trampled the heart of this Charles County city's downtown, turning 20 blocks of homes and offices to plaster and sticks, kicking over the water tower, propelling a peaked roof from one building and dropping it on the flattened remains of another. The tornado stomped a 10,000-square-foot hardware store. La Plata, a Southern Maryland town of 6,000 that is shifting from farming to housing for Washington suburbanites, took the brunt of a rampage of tornadoes that raced from Missouri to the Chesapeake Bay on Sunday. The tornado that touched down here struck the hardest, landing with a F5 force, the highest level on National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's scale. At F5 on the Fujita Tornado Damage Scale, the agency said, a tornado's winds reach 261 to 318 miles an hour, fierce enough to blow frame houses off their foundations, strip bark from trees and catapult automobiles. Missouri, Illinois and Kentucky each reported one death from Sunday's storms. The atmospheric agency attributed the ferocity of the storms to collisions of warm wet air from the Gulf of Mexico and a higher layer of cold dry air from Canada and a storm moving from the Middle West toward the Mid-Atlantic. The tornado that hit La Plata at 7:05 p.m. left two people dead, killing one motorist by flipping his car and another by collapsing the roof of a new home he and his wife had gone to inspect. Twenty miles east, in Calvert County town of Prince Frederick, a tornado left one more dead. ''It tossed us like matchsticks,'' said Murray Levy, president of the Charles County Commission, who was touring the scene today with Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and other state politicians. ''It happened in two seconds.'' Nina W. Voehl, the Charles County spokeswoman, said that 12 county residents were airlifted to hospitals and that more than 120 were injured. Linne Anderson, spokeswoman for the American Red Cross, said the tornado destroyed 80 homes in Southern Maryland. Walking through downtown La Plata, Kevin Benson, 24, pointed to a football field's worth of debris just off the main thoroughfare. ''That was the post office,'' Mr. Benson said. ''That was Mitchell's Hardware. They were a bunch of little houses that had businesses in them.'' When the tornado struck, he said, ''all you could hear was people screaming people's names and car alarms going off and alarms going off at businesses and the emergency lights flashing at the courthouse.'' Gov. Parris N. Glendening declared states of emergency in Charles and Calvert Counties, making them eligible for state aid. Ms. Townsend said state officials would also ask the Bush administration to declare a natural disaster, opening the way for federal help. The governor authorized the deployment of National Guard troops to the counties today. The La Plata police imposed a 9 p.m. curfew tonight. Ms. Voehl, the county spokeswoman, said that the National Weather Service issued a tornado warning four hours before La Plata was hit. But residents said they became aware of one only when they saw the tornado and heard it. Thomas E. Hutchins, a Charles County representative in the Maryland House of Delegates, said he was fishing with his 5-year-old son from a pier on the Tobacco River just before 7 p.m. His son noticed the darkening skies and asked if it was a tornado approaching, Mr. Hutchins said. ''I looked up at the head of the river,'' he said. ''I said, 'Let's go in.' '' They made it into their house, and in an instant, he said, ''the lights went out.'' Their home was untouched. Deborah McClain sat in a room in an EconoLodge Hotel tonight in nearby Waldorf, her six children, her husband, Wayne, and her few remaining possessions surrounding her. Just about everything she had was gone, Mrs. McClain said, except what mattered most. She recalled her 13-year-old son, Dominique, saying that the tornado was approaching their home. ''We didn't believe him,'' she said. ''We figured it was just a thunderstorm.'' Then Mrs. McClain's husband pulled back a curtain and saw the funnel cloud. ''He screamed, 'Everybody get up! Get up! Get in the basement now!' So we ran down and we hid behind the couch. It sounded like a freight train was coming right through our house. And we could hear things crashing and glass shattering.'' When the howling finally subsided, Mrs. McClain walked through the first floor, in shambles, covered in glass, then started for the second floor. ''I climbed two steps and looked up and could see only sky,'' she said. Tonight, though, she gives thanks that she lives in a sturdy, two-story brick house, perhaps most important with a basement. ''It didn't really hit until today when we went back and saw our house and saw the damage to the town,'' she said. Mrs. McClain added that just before they left the house on Sunday night, she and her family ''all came together to say a prayer and give thanks that we're all still alive.'' The race for the basement is a response that has become a part of the local culture since the last tornado hit, in November 1926. Frances Winkler, 82, was in the second grade then. After a Mass today at Sacred Heart Ms. Winkler said, ''That one hit my school. Thirteen were killed, right then and there.'' But in another way this one was worse, she said: ''That tornado did not demolish our town like this one has.''"
"A WORLD TURNED OVER A Killer Tornado and the Lives It Changed Forever. By Lorian Hemingway. 244 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. $23. LORIAN HEMINGWAY grew up with a wariness toward the weather -- an attitude that was extreme even in Mississippi, where most people regarded the elements with the same respectful fear they showed toward God. From early on, she had a doomsaying nature; her eccentric grandmother filled her head with haunting stories about tornadoes. ''I knew, but did not know when,'' Hemingway writes. ''Yet it seemed more than innate negativity, more than just a lucky guess that what finally happened was what I feared would happen all along.'' ''A World Turned Over'' is about the tornado that finally happened, on March 3, 1966. It tore through central Mississippi, ravaged Hemingway's hometown of South Jackson, killed 57 people in the state and changed forever the lives it brushed and the towns it passed through, a few months after the 10-year-old doomsayer and her family had moved away. Hemingway, the author of a memoir, ''Walk on Water,'' returned to South Jackson to remember it as it was, to discover how it has changed, to interview survivors and to find a way to confront and pay homage to the deeply scarred place she calls home. The first half of the book focuses on the 1960's. South Jackson was a brand-new suburb with a modern shopping center, all built on marshland and pastures near a fast-running creek and riverbanks choked with blackberry bramble, honeysuckle and poison ivy. It was a place where men addressed their fathers as ''Daddy'' and more than just the school-aged possessed a naïve sense of invincibility. Hemingway's prose, recalling this universe, is lush and evocative: ''It was the kind of early spring Mississippi afternoon that you come to know when you live there. The air was waterlogged, heavy and wet like cotton in the fields after rain, and the smell of the clay was strong in the air, rusty and old and undeniably organic.'' The townspeople include God-fearing families; a ''blond angel'' of a science teacher; high school upperclassmen sharing Coca-Colas with two straws and the scabby-kneed ''creek urchin pack of kids'' who admired them; and the town heartthrob -- ''a boy of infinite fairness'' with whom even the old church ladies were smitten. Hemingway's South Jackson is so wholesome and wild, so sweet and ecstatic that it is no wonder she feared it was doomed. Hemingway follows several people through that fateful day in March, documenting their actions until 4:33 p.m., and then methodically recounting the destruction of their world. The packed shopping center was reduced to glass shards and rubble, power lines and orchards lay in piles like matchsticks, and the town heartthrob gave up his life in saving another's. ''What had once sat bright and engaging before us, the place where we had marked time by the degree of our naïveté . . . became now a busted-up, blown-through memory, the way it is when you go back home and everything is smaller, the way it is when you go back home and everyone is dead.'' The book's second half describes Hemingway's return to South Jackson, where once-manicured neighborhoods sag in disrepair and the parking lot of the rebuilt shopping center is overrun with weeds. The reader is forced to reread several of the quotations Hemingway used in her account of the tornado. While the prose is still lovely, after the first few revelatory instances (so this is how she knows!), the redundancies begin to feel like the author showing us her homework. Still, the interviews create striking character portraits, fill in several stories, reveal the ways people have and have not dealt with the disaster (in one instance, Hemingway's interview is the first time a family has discussed it together) and create a forum for the questions that come with poking at a wound: Why them and not me? How can a place possess people so entirely? And why is the girl who got away the one to tell the story? Through her questioning and documentation, Hemingway does tell the full story and pays homage to a place that is ''owed the story of its tragedy and the mortal price of its endurance.'' Michelle Maisto is a writer in New York."
"Stunned and weary, survivors of the tornadoes that tore a 1,000-mile swath of the country sifted through the shards of 36 lost lives and hundreds of homes today. Quentin Woody, 11, who was sucked from the shower in his mobile home and blown 300 yards away stark naked, tiptoed through a mud-soaked field here that was smeared with his family's belongings as his mother lay in a hospital with a broken back. He found his 13-year-old sister Sarah's camera. She had broken her arm. His father was in the hospital, too, with badly injured shoulders. But Quentin, somehow, only needed a few stitches, which he was only too eager to show the television photographers who kept asking. ''I don't know what I thought,'' he said, describing the deafening howl that came just before he lost his towel, his footing, and then his consciousness. ''I guess I thought, we're going for a ride.'' He pointed to a ''brown spot'' where the ride had begun: that was where his home had stood. The trailer's floor wound up across Highway 27, a half-mile away, beyond the tree where Quentin's younger brother's red book bag could be seen shimmering gently in the branches of a denuded tree. As Quentin scuffed his new sneakers on the detritus of the only home he had ever known, a squadron of civil air patrolmen pitched in, stacking clothes in one pile, wood in another, metal in another; anything remotely worth saving was gently placed in Quentin's aunt's pickup. Across what was left of this tiny hamlet and others like it, family members, neighbors and total strangers did the same at hundreds of households turned junk heaps. Tennessee arguably endured the worst of the storm front that swept up from Louisiana late Sunday and early Monday, setting off at least 88 tornadoes all the way from Arkansas to Pennsylvania, with wind gusts as powerful as 200 miles per hour, the National Weather Service said. In Tennessee alone, more than 150 homes were destroyed and 1,200 damaged in 25 out of 95 counties, 16 people were killed, and 95 were injured, state emergency-management officials said. The damage seemed evenly spread from west to east Tennessee, officials said, but seven residents were killed here in Morgan County, 41 houses and 15 mobile homes destroyed or rendered uninhabitable. What little good news there was today came early, when officials here reported that 39 people who remained missing late Monday had turned up. Only one person remained unaccounted for, but officials said they believed that was a mistake, and the search and rescue teams were sent home today after making their fourth pass through the area. By late afternoon, however, as temperatures dropped and traffic snarled, troopers shut the highways down again to allow utility crews to sink new electric poles and get the power on. But the traffic jams made it only that much more difficult to get heavy, debris-removing equipment into the area, said Bob Swabe, regional director of the state emergency management agency. Mr. Swabe said he expected a federal disaster declaration by the end of the week, which would release much-needed relief money and reimbursements to the struggling county government. Only 20,000 people live in Morgan, many of them guards at the Brushy Mountain state prison, and the per capita income is less than $13,000. Mossy Grove, 40 miles west of Knoxville, is so small that it is not even on the Tennessee road map. If it had been, the tornadoes that came hollering down from over Lone Mountain and across the aptly named Bitter Creek could well have erased it. As it is, the twisters gouged a half-mile-wide path about five miles long, from here clear across the hills into Joyner and Petros, officials say, before finally spinning to a halt, practically at the front door to the penitentiary. Today, the path the tornadoes took was a surreal study in contrasting sights, sounds and smells: up in the hills, the leaves on the trees rustled in the clean mountain air, ablaze in red and gold; from the roadside, wet, wind-hewn branches and uprooted tree stumps crackled and smoked in growing bonfires as workers busied themselves with chain saws. In Joyner, members of the Leopper family from as far away as Duluth, Ga., converged on what had been their ancestral home. The family matriarch, Vinalene Leopper, was killed a month shy of her 94th birthday. Her son, Henry, and his wife, Faye, were badly injured. Henry's son Bryan, 45, whose muscular dystrophy had just forced him to quit as the county finance director, was also killed. Neighbors who were able to take shelter before the storm hit came running when they emerged, but it was too late: the Leoppers had not been able to find a safe hiding place. ''There was a basement, but they couldn't have gotten Bryan or my grandmother into the basement,'' said Loretta Marlow, a niece of Henry Leopper's. The basement now is all that remains; ; everything above the foundation has either fallen into it or is gone, strewn as far as a stand of pine trees a rifle-shot away. The lone remaining occupant of the house is Devon, the family cat, who moved about in the rubble, but out of training, or fidelity, or just plain bewilderment, refused to leave the premises. ''He won't come out even to eat,'' Ms. Marlow said. No one expects the Leoppers to rebuild, relatives said. They were merely sorting through the rubble and scavenging for clothes for Henry and Faye, who will probably move in with relatives up the road when they get of the hospital, relatives said. Nature had always been good to her family, said Gail Leary, another niece of Henry Leopper's. As a child she romped in her grandfather's apple orchard outside his window, and relatives still farm the land as far as the eye can see, she said. Nature had given residents of Morgan County a sense of security, too, officials said. The mountains that ring the county, part of the Cumberland Plateau, which cuts clear across the state, between Nashville and Knoxville, were thought to provide a shield against such high winds. Tommy Kilby, the county executive, said he and a committee had been working for a year on a disaster preparation plan but never gave a moment's thought to the danger posed by tornadoes. ''If you live in Morgan County, Tenn., and they're telling you a tornado's coming -- I've lived here 38 years -- you don't really expect a tornado to come,'' he said. For that reason, Mr. Kilby said, there was no warning system. ''We may look at the possibility of a siren horn in our county now,'' he said."
"Federal storm scientists yesterday raised the count of tornadoes that struck Sunday and Monday to 88 from 69 and said the tally was likely to continue rising for several weeks as they examined local weather and damage reports. The scientists also mapped out the forces that created the twister outbreak, the worst in November in a decade, and saw in them a distinctive but rare recipe for widespread disaster: a collision between a big pre-winter gush of frigid air and an unusually broad reservoir of residual tropical warmth and moisture flowing from the Gulf of Mexico. Tornadoes are generally loners, arising as some particularly potent thunderstorm spins the air in just the wrong way. But every once in a while broad layers of air high in the atmosphere, moving rapidly in different directions, can lead to outbreaks of dozens of twisters spread over hundreds of miles. That is what happened in the latest severe-weather assault, federal meteorologists said. The violent weather unfolded well to the east of Tornado Alley, the swath from Texas and Louisiana to North Dakota where conditions are most frequently primed to produce twisters. Tornado outbreaks are less consistent geographically than individual tornadoes, mainly because the rare confluence of conditions that create them can occur anywhere. The potential for big trouble became evident late Saturday night, and the first federal advisory of 2002 stating that there was a high risk of an outbreak of many tornadoes was issued at midnight. The alert called for caution across a broad stretch of the South and Midwest on Sunday, and -- along with dozens of specific tornado warnings -- undoubtedly kept the death toll from climbing higher than it did, experts said. Meteorologists, using radar and other sensors that can chart the speed of different masses of air, noted a sharp southerly dip and then northerly twist in the jet stream, 18,000 feet up in the atmosphere, that sent a 110-mile-an-hour flow of frigid air from northern Texas all the way to western New York. Beneath that cold flow, warm moist air was shifting north at a relatively leisurely 50 m.p.h. from the gulf toward the Great Lakes, said Dan McCarthy, a warning coordinator and meteorologist at the National Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Okla. A cold front pushing east from the Rockies added power by building the temperature contrast between adjacent air layers. Where two such layers meet, potent thunderstorms can arise, causing huge updrafts that can spin off cylinders of spinning air -- not unlike the way a child's rubbed palms can turn a lump of modeling clay into a worm. Some of those cylinders can reach toward the earth as tornadoes. This took place at least 88 times along the latest storm front, Mr. McCarthy said, with the three strongest storms apparently registering a 3 out of 5 on the Fujita scale of intensity, with winds of 158 to 206 m.p.h. A final count, and a final estimate of the number of extremely damaging storms, must await more thorough inspections of damage and radar, he said. Most tornado swarms occur in the early spring and late fall, when clashes of cold and warm air are most likely, scientists said. But they can occur in any season. The worst tornado assault ever recorded in the United States struck April 3 and 4, 1974. In that outbreak, 148 twisters struck 13 states, killing 330 people and injuring 5,500 more, weather officials said. The tornado swarm most similar to the one that struck on Sunday and Monday, federal weather officials said, occurred Nov. 21 to 23, 1992, when 94 tornadoes ripped across 13 states, killing 26 people. The ability of federal experts to forecast such outbreaks has greatly improved, said Roger M. Wakimoto, a veteran tornado chaser and a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of California at Los Angeles. Dr. Wakimoto said the specificity of the advanced warning last weekend undoubtedly helped prepare the right communities, while avoiding unnecessary fears elsewhere. ''It's important to be right often enough that people pay attention,'' he said. ''They clearly got this one right.''"
"For people here, schools are not just buildings that can be rebuilt bigger and better. They are singular places, of community tradition, memory and pride. That is why it was so devastating this summer when Carbon Hill High School burned to the ground. That is why, five months later, teachers, parents and children feel about as uprooted as downed trees after a tornado on Sunday ripped apart the city's only other school, Carbon Hill Elementary. It was not the fanciest building in town. In some ways, the aging brick campus on top of the hill looked kind of sad. ''But I hear it every day, 'It was where I went and my daddy went and my daddy before that,' '' said the school superintendent, Alan Trotter. ''Already I'm getting pressure to rebuild the elementary exactly where it was. If we don't, all hell will break loose.'' No power. No phones. No heat. These are practical worries in a post-tornado town. But as residents in Carbon Hill, a poor mining enclave in northwest Alabama, begin the slow crawl back to normalcy, it is the loss of institutions, like churches and schools, that is truly overwhelming. Even the students, who should be ruling the streets thanks to the sudden godsend of a week off, seemed upset. ''It's good we don't have to go to school,'' said a seventh grader, Craig Tyndall. ''But it's bad because we don't have a school.'' He spent the day drifting around with a band of unwashed boys (many homes are without water), watching new power poles get planted in the ground. The streets here smelled like fresh pine from all the giant trees split by the wind. Starting at daybreak, men in beat-up tractors came steaming in from the farmlands, volunteering to help. With cigarettes hanging out of their mouths they cut up tree limbs and dragged them away. Around lunch, several women arrived in town with plastic bowls of food covered in sweating Saran Wrap. Others cooked beef stew at a Red Cross shelter. According to Mayor James Richardson, half the homes in Carbon Hill were damaged by the tornados that swarmed the area on Sunday night. Ten people in surrounding Walker County were killed, most of them by falling trees. More than 50 people were injured. But, looking ahead, it is the public schools, the mayor said, that pose the biggest problem. ''Kids got to be in class,'' Mr. Richardson said. ''And it's like a bad omen. Losing both of our schools in one year? How are we supposed to handle that?'' In Carbon Hill, population 2,100, more than 60 percent of the students are on subsidized lunches. Many fathers are out-of-work coal miners, anchorless after the mines that gave Carbon Hill its name dried up. The city budget is around $2 million a year, less than half the cost of a new elementary school. But the gritty economic situation is also a reason people here are so attached to their schools. College is not on everyone's radar screen. Many people who are born here stay here. In this self-contained world, the memories from the good ol' days are deposited just down the street. ''Oh, buddy, high school,'' said Tabitha Keene, a nursing student who used to go to Carbon Hill High. ''If only these walls could talk. Maybe it's good they're not standing anymore.'' This summer the first blow came. It was June 27, around 9 p.m., when the high school burst into flames. The cause was an electrical fire. The school, built in 1936, was destroyed. Since then, the 330 high school students have been shoehorned into 18 aluminum trailers. For lunch they ate next door at the elementary school, which actually is K through 8, though everybody still calls it ''the elementary.'' But that all changed Sunday night. At 7:18 p.m. -- the yellowed wall clocks are frozen on the minute -- a tornado packing winds of 200 miles an hour arrived at the school with a vengeance. It sucked the roof away. It toppled brick walls. It grabbed gravel from the playground and hurled it through the school's windows, leaving so many neat little holes it looks as if someone peppered the school with a machine gun. ''It's a total loss,'' said Mr. Trotter, as he surveyed the 40-year-old school today. ''We'll salvage what we can. We'll bulldoze the rest.'' Mr. Trotter said that a few months ago when he suggested finding a new location for the high school, he received ''a whole bunch of angry letters.'' ''Everybody in this community really identifies with these schools,'' Mr. Trotter said. ''They are hubs. People don't want them to change.'' The other hubs in the community are the numerous churches that dot the hillsides. Many were heavily damaged, including a rural Baptist church that was leveled and the oldest black church in the county, which now has an oak tree on its roof. This evening, officials decided the only solution to the school problem was to have both the high schoolers and the 540 elementary students share the portable classrooms, at least until more trailers can be found. The younger students will go to school in the morning; the older ones will come in the afternoon. One idea for subsidized meals was giving the younger kids a sack lunch to eat on the bus ride home. ''It's been an unbelievable year,'' said the Walker County chairman, Bruce Hamrick. As night fell on Carbon Hill, candles flickered in many windows. With more than 100 utility poles down, electricity is not expected back on for another week. Without TV or video games, teenagers had little to do but stand in sweatshirts outside of cold homes and talk in the darkness. One thing was kind of nice, though. The smell of wood-burning fires. If Carbon Hill has anything these days, it is plenty of freshly sawed firewood."
"As small children hunkered down in the hall and the restrooms of the local movie theater, the winds outside raged, a tornado carving a path of destruction. Moments earlier, about 50 people who had come for the Sunday matinee sat in four of the five screening rooms of the Van Wert Cinemas watching movies. But then Scott Shaffer, the theater manager, was alerted that a tornado was headed their way. He did, officials said, the only thing he could: He ordered everyone out of the theaters and into the corridor and restrooms for cover. Today, Mr. Shaffer was being heralded for his quick thinking and sure instructions and for ushering the moviegoers to safety. Officials said Mr. Shaffer put the theater's emergency tornado plan into effect, moving people from the screening rooms to the central area of the building where it was more structurally sound. When the tornado made its way through the theater complex, it tore the roofs off Theaters 2 and 5. It also destroyed Theater 1, punctuating the howling chaos by dropping three cars into the screening room. Jessica Ross, 16, who had just seen the movie ''8 Mile,'' found a spot on the restroom floor, covered her head with her hands and prayed as the walls and roof vibrated and the sound of breaking glass erupted. ''You could feel the walls shaking and you could feel it raining on you,'' Miss Ross, a high school junior, recalled today, standing blocks from the five-theater complex. ''When the whole thing had passed over us, the ceiling was halfway gone. And there was water and trash and glass all over the floor. And I think there was also a girl unconscious in there,'' Miss Ross said. ''I went outside and I saw the walls and the ceiling of another theater was all gone. The cars were inside where the screen should have been.'' About 60 people were in the building when the tornado hit, the general manager, Robert Finger, said. No one was killed, officials said, though two people, including Mr. Shaffer, received minor injuries. Two people were killed elsewhere in Van Wert. Mr. Finger said that about two years ago the county's emergency management agency equipped the theater with a weather monitor that provides alerts when there are potential dangerous weather conditions. He said that the monitor had sounded on Sunday, alerting Mr. Shaffer to the possibility of a tornado, and that Mr. Shaffer had informed the people in the theater about the warning. Minutes later, Mr. Finger said, Mr. Shaffer looked out a window and spotted a twister moving toward the movie house. ''The second he spotted it, he yelled, 'It's coming,' '' Mr. Finger said, adding that the theater's employees helped Mr. Shaffer lead everyone to safety. Jim Boyd, the theater's owner, said that had the tornado hit a few minutes earlier, during a first, sold-out matinee of ''Santa Clause 2,'' the outcome could have been different. And on the day after what local officials were calling the worst tornado disaster in recent memory, many were sighing with relief that the loss of life was not greater. Even so, there was devastation here in Van Wert, a town about 110 miles southwest of Toledo -- shattered homes and a trail of debris, glass, and mangled and twisted steel. Also destroyed were several factories that officials here say will mean the loss of hundreds of jobs only weeks before Christmas. In Van Wert today, some people sifted through the rubble of what remained of their homes. Chain saws buzzed as workers removed fallen limbs and trees. Strips of aluminum siding dangled like a cloth curtain hung in trees. Outside the theater -- the only one in town -- debris and glass covered the ground. The adjacent drive-in theater lay in ruins. Hugh Saunier, a spokesman for the Van Wert County Emergency Management Agency, said that four tornadoes had been spotted about 3:10 p.m. on Sunday in the southwest part of the county. Mr. Saunier said there was no damage reported from those sightings. But 10 minutes later came the news that one of the twisters had developed into a category F4, with winds of more than 200 miles an hour and measuring 1,000 yards across. Officials said the tornado struck Van Wert, a town of about 10,000, about 3:30. Officials said the two people in Van Wert killed in the storm were an elderly man in his home and a teenage boy in his vehicle. Officials also said that 19 people were treated at a local hospital for injuries. Three of them were critically injured. Today, the Ohio Emergency Management Agency brought a team into town to assist with cleanup and recovery. They were assisted by the Ohio National Guard. Officials said all town residents had been accounted for. A manufacturing and farming town, Van Wert also had several factories heavily damaged by the storm, Mr. Saunier said. The authorities have estimated that the damage to homes and businesses will be in the tens of millions of dollars. ''We lost about 300,000 square feet of industrial manufacturing space, which means we lost between 300 and 500 jobs,'' Mr. Saunier said. Officials said that 48 houses and 2 mobile homes were destroyed, and that 23 houses sustained major damage while 17 others suffered minor damage. Some 1,700 houses were still without power late this afternoon. Gov. Bob Taft declared Van Wert County, which has a population of 32,000, a disaster area. Mr. Boyd, who added three screening rooms just last year, surveyed the scene today where his business lay in ruins. He also owned the adjacent drive-in and a three-bedroom house nearby. Everything lay in shambles. ''I'm not sure we have totally come to grips with it,'' Mr. Boyd said, standing near his house where a wall had been blown away. ''We have lost what I have taken all my life to build.'' Still, he said he could see things in perspective. ''I'm alive,'' said Mr. Boyd, adding that he and his wife, Joyce, were visiting his mother about a mile away when the storm hit. ''Given all of the destruction that you see around you,'' he said, ''I feel as though there were more miracles that occurred. God is still in control. Our faith is sustaining us through this.'' A TRAIL OF DESTRUCTION: THE SURVIVORS"
"The death toll reached 36 today after dozens of tornadoes sliced their way from Louisiana to Pennsylvania late Sunday, carving up farmland and forests and nearly erasing whole communities in Alabama, Tennessee and Ohio. The National Weather Service said it was one of the worst November tornado outbreaks on record. Seventeen people were killed here in Tennessee, 12 in Alabama, 5 in Ohio and 1 each in Mississippi and Pennsylvania. In Tennessee, Black Hawk helicopter crews and overwhelmed rescue workers on the ground continued to search for the dozens who remained unaccounted for. Tens of thousands of people in several states were still without power tonight. The weather service had issued warnings beginning Saturday night after spotting a vast high-altitude cold front from Texas to New York, zooming east at 110 miles per hour, on a collision path with a broad, warm and moist air mass beneath it, drifting north from the Gulf of Mexico. The resulting turbulence spawned at least 66 tornadoes along the storm front, officials said, a few registering a 3 out of 5 on the Fujita scale of tornado intensity, with winds of 158 to 206 miles an hour. Many of those twisters remained on the ground for 15 to 20 miles at a time. One, in Walker County, Ala., where 10 people died, left a track 50 miles long, said Brian Peters, a meteorologist for the weather service in Birmingham. ''We saw places where there were just a few trees down, then we saw entire pine forests wiped out and laid down,'' Mr. Peters said today after surveying the damage. ''We saw one chicken house with literally thousands of dead chickens sitting there. We saw mobile homes thrown into ponds.'' The worst damage in Walker County was in Carbon Hill, where about a third of the town was destroyed after trees came crashing down on homes. In Van Wert, Ohio, 2 people were killed. But about 50 moviegoers, including a number of parents and children who had just seen the movie ''Santa Clause 2,'' were spared when a theater manager heeded a tornado warning and ushered the audience to the halls and bathrooms in a sturdier part of the building. It was the only part of the multiplex left intact when the winds calmed. Tornadoes, though, are common in the spring and rare in the fall, experts say. But Mark A. Rose, a meteorologist at the weather station in Nashville, said unseasonably warm weather made all the difference: temperatures on Sunday reached a record 81 degrees, 20 degrees above normal. At least 18 tornadoes were counted in Tennessee, he said. Mr. Rose said ''baseball sized'' hailstones fell in Cumberland County, west of Morgan. ''It takes a tremendous updraft to create that sort of hail, to hold it aloft long enough to create that size of hail,'' he said. The worst recent tornado outbreak sent 70 twisters through Oklahoma and Kansas in May 1999, killing 44 people. But the most similar tornado swarm to Sunday's, weather officials said, struck from Nov. 21 to 23, 1992, when 94 tornadoes ripped across 13 states, killing 26 people and causing about $300 million in damage. Tennessee, where at least 17 people were killed and 55 injured, was hardest hit this time. In Coffee County, Art Bowman, the owner of a cluster of rented houses that were in the tornado's path, watched the funnel cloud approach from his back porch in Manchester. ''This is bad,'' he remembered thinking. ''This is going to get us. We're going to get hit. ''I heard a roar and the lightning was like a strobe light,'' he said. He watched the tornado pick up mobile homes and houses and flip an S.U.V. in the air like a nickel, then ran inside and got on top of his children in the bathtub. ''I said, 'Please, God, don't let this be happening,' and by the time I said 'happening,' it was over.'' Hobert Collins, 58, was driving through Georgia today when his wife told him by cellphone that their grandson, Hobert III, was missing. ''She told me Lucille's house was gone and they couldn't find baby Hobert,'' he said, and burst into tears. ''Them kids were my life,'' he said after racing back home. ''That's all I got to live for.'' In Morgan County, a boy and his grandfather were killed. The boy's parents remained in critical condition. Two other men were missing after their truck ran off the road. They had been deer hunting; the deer was found in the top of a tree, 500 feet away. Here in Mossy Grove, a hamlet 40 miles west of Knoxville, 5 people were killed, 23 were injured, and dozens more were left homeless and staggered by the destruction. Officials said they had thought that the hilly topography would protect residents from high winds. But survivors said the tornado swept down over the hills about 8:30 p.m. It scoured a clean path several hundred yards wide through what had been a quiet, shady neighborhood of mobile homes and brick ranches. Today, Kevin Freels, 31, wandered about the slab that had been his house, calling to his 9-year-old daughter to duck underneath a downed power line that came up to her neck, pointing to his wife, now hobbling about with a walker. ''I got the family in the tub, and there wasn't any room for me, so I got beside it,'' Mr. Freels recalled, picking at the bandages on his hands. ''Five or 10 seconds before it hit, the whole house started shaking,'' he said. ''Then it was 'Crash! Crash! Boom!' The power went off, there was water everywhere, and I realize the roof came off. It felt like somebody was spraying me full on in the face with a garden hose. The wind, the two-by-fours breaking, concrete blocks and glass shattering when it was finally over, the tub they were in was upside down but they were O.K.'' His prized possession, a 1970 Dodge Challenger that Mr. Freels had lovingly restored from a $400 heap to a trophy-winning classic, was now a heap. ''It took the garage, all my cars, the house, and everything, but it left us four there,'' he said of the storm and the survival of those in his home, including his mother. ''That had to be God protecting us. I got to give Him credit, because that's the only thing that saved us.'' Few houses had basements here, and when the winds started howling, Fred and Susan Henry ran with their son and daughter down the hill to a neighbor's house, where both families took shelter downstairs. Minutes later, she said, a Jeep and a car came crashing into the side of the house, toppling a wall on top of her daughter, Tabitha, 17. The house above them began to peel away, Tabitha said, and when the wind began to suck her little brother up into its vortex, she and her parents stopped praying and screaming and grabbed 9-year-old Justin in midair by the ankles. The tornado had already taken his shoes. ''My mom had him, so my dad and myself grabbed a hold of my mom,'' said Tabitha, limping today among the splinters of furniture, muddy shreds of unrecognizable clothes and incongruously intact pickle jars in the heap that used to be her home. She wore a borrowed sweatsuit; the wind had stripped her clothes off. The Henry family held onto one another, and survived. Others could not. Russell Hines ran out of his trailer to check on his family a short drive away but never made it into his vehicle. Tracy Goode and her two baby girls were riding with her father in his Chevy Blazer; the red Blazer wound up in a swampy cow pasture 300 yards from the nearest road. Her 4-month-old daughter was killed, but the 2-year-old survived. Mike Williams, 26, picked over the ruins where his father had lived with his girlfriend. The couple were killed inside. Nearby, Mr. Williams's ailing grandmother was killed and his mother, who had been caring for her, was critically injured when their house, too, was obliterated. Mr. Williams, who worked alongside his father as a guard at the state prison near here, was a bundle of motion this afternoon, stacking magazines no one would ever read again and gathering his father's old paychecks. ''I'm just trying to keep going,'' he said. ''I don't even know where to start.'' He had been in Lansing, 20 miles away, when he heard the tornado warning, he said. ''I called my grandmother's house at 8:29,'' Mr. Williams said. ''My mom was watching her, so I told her to get in the basement.'' He called his father's house next, but the line was already dead. His father, Mr. Williams learned today, had just returned home after inviting a neighbor out to dinner. ''He wasn't here like five minutes, I reckon, when it hit,'' Mr. Williams said. The biggest church in town, the barn-sized New Life Apostolic, was left unusable, its tin walls and roof crumpled in and bent back like a soda can, its yellow insulation now blossoming on the few trees that remained in its backyard. On the other side of the tornado's track, a sign at the Fellowship Baptist Church, which bore witness from the edge of the destruction but was somehow untouched, carried a now-empty promise: ''Revival -- Nov. 11-15.'' A TRAIL OF DESTRUCTION: THE OVERVIEW"
"At dusk on April 28, this town 30 miles south of Washington became No. 94 on the list of unlucky places struck since 1880 by F-5 tornados, the rare class of supertwisters that produces almost unimaginable destruction. Four people died, more than 100 were injured, and a raw gash was cut across 24 miles of forests, lawns, roads and farmland. Four days later, a team assembled by the National Weather Service to review the damage and assess forecasting skill walked house to house, trying to gauge the tornado's destructive power more thoroughly. The team was also eager to glean new clues about the most potent class of tornado, which despite decades of storm chasing and improved radar and satellite monitoring remains a deadly enigma. Although meteorologists have greatly improved their understanding of how certain conditions generate especially powerful thunderstorms and how these towering heat engines can spin out twisters, the experts have yet to figure out what ingredients spawn an F-5. ''This is still fundamentally one of the things we can't predict,'' said Dr. Harold E. Brooks, a research meteorologist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla. ''I'm not even sure we know what measurements we need to take to try to understand them.'' [A potent tornado killed two people on Sunday in Happy, Tex. Meteorologists had not yet finished analyzing its strength by Monday evening.] Some twisters explode from unremarkable thunderheads, and then there are towering supercells, thunderstorms that are tornado makers, that pass without incident, said Thomas P. Grazulis, a meteorologist and the author of ''The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm,'' published last year. ''Progress is incredibly slow, because you have three or four case studies a year,'' he said. ''But they all turn out to be different.'' The meteorologists and engineers who gathered here were looking for physical manifestations of the storm's intensity, assessing the sturdiness of shattered houses and the distance traveled by heavy objects. It is no simple task, because every building is built differently and responds to wind differently. Also, damage is just partly a function of wind. More often, it results from objects carried in the air. ''Pure wind doesn't do the damage,'' said Timothy P. Marshall, a structural engineer and meteorologist at an engineering firm in Houston and a volunteers in federal studies of tornado damage. ''The churning debris acts like a blender.'' Another complication is storm speed. Slow-moving tornadoes can be particularly devastating: they grind away, sometimes for minutes at a time. One F-5 in Texas stayed on top of a house for three minutes, Mr. Marshall said, adding: ''They never had a chance. Trees were completely shredded. The road pavement was gone. The ground was gone.'' The destruction of a building, too, is not just a result of a storm, but also of the quality of construction. In and around La Plata, many houses -- old and new -- did not appear well built, Mr. Marshall said, with frames weakly connected to foundations. The official determination of the intensity will not be released for many weeks. The F scale for tornadoes mainly considers damage, not wind speed. It was devised in 1971 by Dr. T. Theodore Fujita, a Japanese-born meteorologist and damage expert whose first experience investigating a disaster zone was at Hiroshima. In going from wimpy, almost inconsequential F-0 to devastating F-5, Dr. Fujita, who died in 1998 after a long career at the University of Chicago, nearly ran out of descriptive terms. The most potent storms produce ''incredible phenomena,'' Dr. Fujita wrote. Among those, he said, ''automobile-size missiles fly through the air in excess of 100 meters'' and sturdy houses are ''lifted off foundations and swept away.'' In this town of 6,500 people and the other blasted parts of Charles County along the tornado's 24-mile path, incredible phenomena occurred. La Plata's water tower crumpled like a stomped daddy longlegs. The tornado destroyed 344 houses and businesses. But just steps outside its quarter-mile-wide path, unscathed tulips nodded in the breeze. The randomness and unpredictability of what survives and what is pulverized after such tornadoes is an echo of the persistent unpredictability of the most powerful storms themselves, experts say. Generally, conditions are prime when cool dry air flows over warm, moist air near the surface, setting up turbulent conditions in which air masses clash. In the biggest storms, or supercells, the air rotates as updrafts burst toward the stratosphere. These effects can create whirling vortexes deep inside a storm that, if jogged just right, push down toward the ground, as well as up into the sky. Finding the right trigger at the right time is the trick that keeps the giant storms rare. Together, F-5's and F-4's, which create damage that Dr. Fujita described as merely ''devastating,'' account for 1 percent or so of the 1,000 tornadoes that form in the United States each year. Just 10 percent are F-2 or higher. In what many experts say is the definitive analysis of accounts of past tornadoes, Mr. Grazulis, who runs the Tornado Project, a business centered on tornado lore in St. Johnsbury, Vt., cites a storm that exploded through Christian, Ill., on April 24, 1880, as the first American F-5. The destruction is mainly focused in the Midwest and South, across a zone called Tornado Alley where cool dry Canadian air often clashes with warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. But the destruction extends as far north as Saskatchewan and -- now -- as far east as Maryland. For Tom Posey Sr., 72, a lifelong resident, the meaning of F-5, his personal ''incredible phenomenon,'' was the utter disintegration of Posey's, a grocery store that his kin ran in a 40-year-old building that he owned. He kicked at the rubble and supervised two young men as they removed a safe. The roof was long gone, and the walls only vaguely represented by flung, shattered cinder blocks. Incredibly, some sets of shelves still stood, still holding bottles of salad dressing and jars of spaghetti sauce. The sign out front, which had adjustable plastic letters that before the storm had advertised a special on a Maryland delicacy, stuffed ham, was ragged, but still stood. Mr. Posey pointed out that someone had rearranged the letters that had not blown away. One side of the sign now displayed, ''We Are Tuff.''"
"Buddy Norris, a retired developer who worked decades to help change this old farm town into a nascent suburb, lingered uncertainly this morning along the long, raw scar left by the tornado that lashed through here Sunday. Amid the sea of flotsam and jetsam that the tornado made of downtown La Plata, Mr. Norris brightened at the approach of a gang of Amish volunteers with chain saws. ''Hey you guys!'' Mr. Norris hailed the visitors. ''Do you know what a blessing you've been?'' The Amish men, some bearded, some boyish, smiled but had little to say as they headed on toward an utterly smashed two-story house on LaGrange Avenue and revved up their saws. ''Those Amish don't talk; they just work,'' said Mr. Norris's brother, Howard, as an army of clean-up volunteers from a score of outside communities worked side by side with residents to push this stricken town onto a determined course of reconstruction. ''It's a new ballgame,'' declared Mayor William Eckman as he rallied residents to the rebuilding task already primed by an emergency planning outlay of $400,000 from the state. With the tornado's toll at three dead and more than 400 homes and businesses damaged or destroyed, the federal government declared a three-county swath of Maryland a disaster area. Paperwork began on reconstruction loans near a clutch of emergency tents and vans outside the busy Charles County center. The tornado, with winds in excess of 260 miles an hour, was officially described as the worst in state history, with damage in excess of $100 million. But a 1926 tornado proved deadlier when it struck the school here and killed 13 children. As emergency shelters were closed, schools reopened. Rain stormed down this morning as commuters, representing about a third of the town's 6,000 residents, headed off on the 90-minute trip north to Washington. Whorls of debris from La Plata homes and businesses were tracked as far as 50 miles to the east across Chesapeake Bay. Strangers arrived searching for the owners of family photographs retrieved from scatterings far and wide across the surrounding farmlands. The town was buttressing its history as much as its infrastructure. ''This old house and others are going to be the cornerstone of history in a rebuilt La Plata,'' Sam Phillips said, surveying the 109-year-old Victorian house that he and his wife, Holly Dunbar, had lovingly restored over the last five years. The house stood up to the tornado but suffered vicious roof gouges, bulging walls and wholesale breakage as the couple's possessions were sucked into the air. ''It's pretty painful, but the roots of the town are right here,'' Mr. Phillips insisted. ''When 13 schoolchildren died in the 1926 tornado, their bodies were carried here and laid out in this house,'' he noted reverently. ''There's a spirit here, and Ace and Lulu Creavett would want us to rebuild,'' he said of the original owners. The fickleness of the tornado was evident as exhausted residents along the north side of Bobwhite Court picked through the shredded and pulverized wreckage while neighbors across the street bore sad witness from houses left untouched. Contractors and insurance adjusters were busy along the most mangled stretches as state authorities warned anxious owners to beware of fly-by-night exploiters promising instant restoration. ''We came from Mechanicsville to do what needs to be done,'' said Enos Hostetler, one of the Amish volunteers who traveled about 20 miles to help. ''You can see these people are going to bounce back. It's sure not going to stay in the state of nothing we're seeing now.'' The rains slickened the debris as bulldozers ground away at the most devastated stretches. ''I got no insurance and no money, and I absolutely have to get my name in for emergency help to rebuild,'' said Ronald Johnson, 47, carpenter whose house was half gone, the remainder peeled open like a wall-free stage set with stairs rising to an open-air bathroom. ''I brushed my teeth at that mirror all my life'' said Mr. Johnson, pointing up in sadness. ''I'm going to get my claw-foot bathtub out of there and make it the starting point for rebuilding the whole house.'' Friends mounted an American flag on the house's remaining bit of roof and defiantly spray-painted ''Open House'' and ''Smile'' on the side that remained, feeding Mr. Johnson's resolve to rebuild. ''My collections of antique bottles, stamps, coins -- all gone, blown somewhere into Delaware,'' Mr. Johnson said, staring forth from his sundered home. ''But I'll tell you, I'm meeting some wonderful strangers come to help.'' Henry Stoltzfus, an Amish volunteer, appeared, offering assistance. ''Save your labor; we got a machine coming to knock the rest of it down,'' Mr. Johnson responded, clapping his arm gratefully across the stranger's back. ''Praise the Lord,'' Mr. Stoltzfus advised. ''Keep showing thumbs up.''"
"A tornado injured dozens of people on Monday and damaged as many as 100 buildings here, and residents returned today to a town devastated by an estimated $20 million in damage. Worn and wearied, Geraldine Pratt swept dust and glass on her sun porch, where bamboo shades once hung in the windows. The shades and the glass were gone. Ms. Pratt, 76, had just returned home from an outing when the tornado hit about 4:30 p.m. Glass shattered, plaster crashed and trees snapped, she recalled at her home today as repair crews with buzz saws worked to clear the debris outside. ''I was hanging on to the doorknob in there going to the basement,'' she said, ''but I couldn't get the basement door open. So I just hung on.'' On Monday, her porch furniture was hanging in trees, both chimneys of her white-frame house were destroyed, the trees she had planted in her backyard over the last 43 years were ruined and all that remained of her garage was a concrete slab. Gov. Scott McCallum declared Rusk County, which includes Ladysmith, and nearby Taylor County in northwestern Wisconsin disaster areas, making them eligible for state aid. The authorities here said they also were seeking federal assistance. The Wisconsin National Guard was expected to arrive in Ladysmith on Wednesday morning to help with the cleanup. Many in this town of 4,000 felt lucky that everyone had survived. ''It's almost impossible to take it in, but I can't let it bother me too much because I'm fine'' Ms. Pratt said. ''I didn't get hurt. I guess that's important. I want to be around a few more years.'' The authorities reported that at least 60 people were injured, most suffering cuts and bruises. After the storm, emergency officials went door to door, searching for victims, including two residents who initially had been unaccounted for. They were later found, officials said. Sherri Williams, a registered nurse at Rusk County Memorial Hospital, where more than 30 people were treated and released, said that given the level of damage, she had expected far worse. ''We were certainly geared up to have more serious injuries,'' Ms. Williams said. ''We're fortunate to have only minor injuries.'' The tornado snaked through the central business district and some residential areas, covering an area about 14 blocks long and four blocks wide. A spokeswoman for the county estimated damages at $20.8 million -- $13.9 million to business and $6.9 million to residential property. City officials said 26 businesses and 17 homes were destroyed. In addition, 94 homes and 77 businesses had minor to major damage, the authorities said. Among the casualties was a Baptist church and a water tower. The American Red Cross and the Salvation Army were operating a shelter opened at a school in nearby Bruce, officials said. A curfew from 8 p.m. to sunrise remained in effect for Ladysmith. Volunteers and city crews worked into the night to clear houses and cars of trees and debris. They covered windows and removed dangling tree limbs or sawed down trees that were severely damaged and lay in waste. There were houses with shattered roofs. Broken glass lined streets, and trees lay in front yards. State Police officers directed traffic on Highway 8, where streets were blocked. Some residents, like Ms. Pratt's daughter, Emilie Pratt, 38, tried to absorb the devastation, standing outside her mother's home. Emilie Pratt lives on the south side of town, where there was no damage. She was returning from an out-of-town trip on Monday when she learned that a tornado had touched down near her mother's house. ''I couldn't even look'' the daughter said. ''My husband said, 'Your mom's house is pretty much gone.' '' Both mother and daughter were still grappling this evening with the loss. Inside the home, some of the antique china that Ms. Pratt has collected for many years lay broken, and part of her ceiling had collapsed. In the yard, all that remained of an apple tree was a stump. A spruce, a dogwood and a pine had also been crippled. ''I just feel so bad because we loved all these trees,'' the elder Ms. Pratt said. ''Most of them we planted. You just can't take it in. I was awake most of the night trying to figure out what really happened, what could have happened or what would have happened.'' The memories of her harrowing moment, clinging to the doorknob, linger. ''I was there thinking, Is the house going to fall in? Is it going to blow away? And is my gas going to explode? You think of all those things in just seconds,'' Ms. Pratt said, standing in her yard. ''That's why I say I'm grateful I'm here.''"
"The questions the merchants in this quaint historic village are pondering today are not when or where to rebuild the flea markets and service shops destroyed by a tornado on Sunday night. The questions are whether to even bother, and how to possibly begin. They had flocked over the past decade to this small town of 1,400 people among the cattle farms in the southwest corner of the state because of the beautifully preserved 1880's buildings that lined its two-block main street. They renovated the second stories into loftlike apartments and filled the street levels with collectibles and kitsch. The women recently lined the sidewalks with flowerpots, and just last month the men finished restoring the original bandstand that sits at the community's heart. Now, instead of the grand archways, columns and crown molding that gave the place its Victorian charm, there are just bricks and plywood and shattered glass -- and a facade marked ''unsafe'' with red spray paint. Many here expect the entire downtown to be bulldozed, perhaps starting this week. Even if the people here want to reconstruct the ruins, and even if they can drum up the money, what is a historic downtown without historic buildings? ''It will never be the town that it was,'' sighed Loretta Gasser, whose husband, Larry, has owned the barbershop for 38 years and is now considering early retirement. ''Here? No,'' a tearful Lavetta Rhinehart said when asked if she planned to rebuild the art studio, art gallery and 2,500-square-foot home she and her husband had lovingly created over the past 20 years on three lots. ''When you pour every ounce of strength and all of the money into something -- I'm just too tired.'' President Bush today officially designated a 39-county swath of Missouri, including Pierce City, and seven counties in Kansas, as disaster areas, clearing the way for the influx of federal money. At the same time, the sheriff here announced that a 20-month-old toddler had been killed by the tornado in nearby Monett. And Tennessee officials raised their death toll to 15. That brought the total number of storm victims to 40, because Missouri officials said today that they had mistakenly counted one victim twice. As another round of tornado and hail warnings were issued in the nation's midsection, in many cases following the path of destruction torn up Sunday night, cleanup efforts began in earnest today in the three hardest-hit states. In southeast Kansas, where a tornado wiped out buildings, power lines and trees along a 32-mile trail, neighbors helped neighbors, keeping an eye on the threatening sky as they chopped felled trees and sifted through lifetimes of belongings in flattened homes. ''I heard a gentleman say he didn't know he had so many neighbors,'' said Cy Frost, deputy sheriff in Cherokee County. In Carl Junction, Mo., the 20-member police department convened in the Masonic Lodge, since a wall of its own headquarters had caved in, and residents ran buzz saws off generators since electricity had not yet been restored. ''The cleanup effort could take months,'' said John Hofer, police chief for the town of 5,296. In Jackson, Tenn., where 11 people died, roads where the stoplights had stopped working became bottlenecks. Officials were busy blocking looters from downtown stores as many people struggled with memories of a similar storm that killed seven residents just four years ago. ''This community will come back,'' said Jerry Gist, the mayor of Madison County, which includes Jackson, ''but there will be a brief feeling of what's the use.'' Here in Pierce City, which has become a destination spot for antique hunters from neighboring states, about 130 members of the 203rd Battalion of the National Guard, whose armory was among the 100 local buildings damaged or destroyed, returned home today from Fort Leonard Wood, where they await deployment to Iraq, to help with the recovery. Teams of structural engineers escorted business owners through their missing picture windows to load salvageable inventory and important papers into pickups and horse trailers. Michael D. Brown, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, spent two hours here between stops in Kansas City, Kan., and Jackson, and said the devastated downtown looked more like the site of a terrorist attack than a natural disaster. ''No matter how much money we put into this community, we're never going to make it whole again,'' said Mr. Brown, who is also under secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. ''The president's going to win the war on terrorism, I'm sure of that. We're never going to win the war against Mother Nature.'' FEMA officials said they would send inspectors to determine whether the downtown buildings should be razed. In any case, Mark Peters, the mayor, and Jack Goodman, who grew up a mile away and represents the area in the State Legislature, said they hoped to salvage decorative architectural artifacts to incorporate into any renovations. But with all of Pierce City's 40 commercial enterprises -- which were expected to bring $384,000 in sales tax revenue this year, nearly half the city's budget -- at least temporarily out of business, the very future of this town is in doubt. ''It's the most unique city you ever saw -- not just the buildings, the people: they care about each other,'' said Margie Curtis, 62, who just recently moved in, following her children. ''You don't want to see that evaporate just because of a disaster. The feelings won't evaporate, but the means to be here may evaporate.'' John Archer, whose antique shop would have celebrated its seventh anniversary on Memorial Day weekend, said, ''If they will let me stay here and if somebody will give me a little bit of money, I plan to put it back just like it was.'' But Gene Kluck, whose Friendly Supply had been a fixture for 57 years, said ''it's too soon for me to tell yet'' whether his vintage 1950's furniture showroom and adjacent hardware store would reopen. ''We have to have his store,'' Mr. Archer said of Mr. Kluck. Ms. Curtis added, ''If you needed something, you just went in there.'' Michelle Bacarisse, who opened a crafts store with her mother here three years ago, said she would like to stay in Pierce City, but had to be realistic about whether the town would continue to draw tourists. ''Our home is here, and I'd like to keep my business here,'' she said, noting that when her father died in September, townspeople she did not even know opened their hearts and hands. ''When your livelihood is totally gone, you still have to have lights, you still have to have heat.'' One model for reconstruction might be Freda Mae's, the gift shop and tea room that celebrated its first anniversary on Thursday. Scott Rector, the owner, tore down most of the original and rebuilt its red-brick facade, with antique windows and other fixtures imported from Illinois and New England, to match the rest of the streetscape. Bryce Garner, chairman of the board of Historic Pierce City, said that ''our downtown looked like Main Street in Disney World,'' and wondered why, with a little help from salvaged remnants, business owners could not fake history. ''We want to put back something like what we had -- we don't want a stainless steel downtown,'' said Mr. Garner, 47, who moved here in 1996 from Dallas in part because of the charm. ''Why can't you recreate the atmosphere and the romance of that with new buildings?'' As they awaited word on whether the buildings were sound enough to save, business owners and residents were allowed to bring one truck each to the disaster area today to load what they could. But some buildings, like the 5,000-square-foot former bank of golden bricks at the corner of Commercial and Walnut, where Michelle Jenkins lived with her husband and 5-year-old son, Brock, were deemed too dangerous to enter. ''I understand that it's structurally unsafe, but can one person come in with me?'' Ms. Jenkins, 30, pleaded with the emergency crew this morning. ''I need my insurance papers -- I know exactly where they are. If not my mementos, if not my life, at least give me a head start on my insurance.'' The men said no way at first, but then one handed over his hard hat, and another gave Ms. Jenkins his safety goggles. A third escorted her upstairs, where comforters sat smoothly on beds and knickknacks were undisturbed, but the roof over much of the apartment was missing. She emerged clutching a sheaf of papers, a church cookbook, a wooden angel statue, and Brock's favorite video, the Wiggles. ''Just so he'll have something of home,'' said Ms. Jenkins, who plans to move her family to Springfield, about 40 miles northeast of here, rather than rebuild. ''We have nothing.''"
"President Bush finished off a two-day, three-state campaign for his half-trillion-dollar tax cuts this afternoon with a stop in a driving rain to see the damage in Pierce City, a town about 45 miles southwest of here that was devastated last week when a tornado tore through its center. Mr. Bush flew over the city in the presidential helicopter, Marine One, as lightning flashed, then was soaked as he spoke to residents on the rubble-strewn main street. Earlier he met with a crowd of several hundred at the St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church parish hall. ''I find it, and I hope you do, uplifting in the midst of tragedy, amongst people who have lost their homes, in some cases their loved one, or their businesses, lost their possessions, that we gather to comfort each other and to find help in the house of the Lord,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Because it's with his strength and his prayer that you'll find the strength to go on.'' On May 4, one of the worst tornadoes in decades ripped through the town's historic main street, destroying every business and damaging or leveling 100 homes. One person was killed. The area has been declared a federal disaster area, and Mr. Bush promised aid. He told the crowd that Americans ''are praying for you,'' but he also said that it was impossible to envision the extent of the damage until it was seen firsthand. ''You can't realize what it's like to see a tornado go right down the main street of a town and just wipe it out,'' he said. Mr. Bush began his day in Indianapolis, where he swooped in overnight to put pressure on Senator Evan Bayh, a Democrat, to support the White House goal of $550 billion in tax cuts over the next decade. So far Mr. Bayh supports only $350 billion in cuts, the limit set by the Senate, including some Republicans, in defiance of the president. Asked this morning if he was willing to go higher than $350 billion in tax cuts, Mr. Bayh responded, ''That depends.'' Mr. Bayh then said he wanted to see the benefits of the tax cut ''targeted more toward middle class families.'' Despite Mr. Bayh's sounds of compromise, he was quoted in The Indianapolis Star this morning as saying that Mr. Bush could just as easily have picked up the phone to lobby him for his vote and that the presidential overnight in his home state would not sway him. ''I hope it's not the Vito Corleone treatment,'' The Star quoted Mr. Bayh as saying, a reference to the persuasive tactics in ''The Godfather.'' Mr. Bush singled out Mr. Bayh for recognition in a speech to 7,000 people in the Pepsi Coliseum at the Indiana State Fairgrounds, and also recognized Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the outgoing White House budget director, who is considering a run for governor of Indiana. ''My man, Mitch,'' Mr. Bush said as Mr. Daniels stood and accepted the crowd's applause."
"Tornadoes lashed the Midwest and South this week, killing 18 in my state and more than a score elsewhere. But in spite of all the horror -- and it is horrible -- there's a calm in this storm that you can't see in the newspaper and television pictures of sudden powerful destruction. People continue to shop, they make mad dashes to the store, cover their flowers, phone friends. It's a paradox: take cover, but first cover what you can. This calm is what allows those of us living in the heartland tornado belt to stay here, despite year after year of scurrying to storm cellars, despite the statistical possibility that a tornado will single out our town and stay awhile, despite the pain and death that this week's storms and the ones before them inflicted. It's the same sort of calm that allows people to live in places outsiders can't imagine -- next to fault lines, in flood zones, in New York City. It is a calm that we gather to us from our knowledge of storms. We're accustomed to them the way we are to a rattler that takes up residence under a crag each spring, or the water moccasin that suns by the creek. We're familiar with the safety system, the network of weather watchers on ground, radio and television, that will keep listeners posted about where the storm is, when it's likely to arrive, and what it's likely to do. Experience also gives us calm. Most people will be safe if they take precautions, and everyone knows what those are: stay away from glass, bricks and anything that can crumble and swirl; get in the center of a structure; have bulwarks around you, even if they must be fashioned out of a desk or a bed. People in this part of the country have basements or a way to get to one. (I recall the comfort I felt on a long stretch of road in Oklahoma where signs show up advising, ''Tornado Shelter Ahead.'') In short, people working together keep themselves from being at the mercy of the weather. They can't control it, but they know a neighbor is keeping one eye peeled. Tradition, the kind that is folklore borne out by experience, gives us that calm, too. Not foolhardiness, mind you, just a thoughtful hope. In Warrensburg, legend holds that American Indians from Sedalia, a somewhat flatter area about 30 miles east, used to move their village here until the tornado season passed. A ridge (or is it a ravine?) that runs across the southern border of town causes tornadoes to skip us. Even if a twister does come through, it won't stay grounded and scour across the land full force. People who live along Crowley's Ridge in southeast Missouri, where I grew up, claim safety from the terrain as well, only there it's a ''trough'' that keeps the tornado from sweeping through the town. We always expected tornadoes, though, trough or not. We had a tornado shelter, a cement room covered with thick soil and honeysuckle. The shelter was too damp to keep supplies in. But during storm season we placed flashlights, blankets, fresh water, bread and peanut butter by the back door of our house, ready for a quick run to safety. We children were taught to look for certain signs -- absolute stillness, the cessation of rain, and a particularly odd color to the air, not that green of rain in a summer rural area but an off cast, recognizable by its oddity. The major warning was a train sound where no train should be. With the exception of the Weather Channel, our preparations six decades ago were the same as today's. We weren't afraid because we knew exactly what to do. There lies the calm; we did all we could and hoped for the best. R. M. Kinder is author of ''Sweet Angel Band and Other Stories.''"
"The relentless barrage of some 80 tornadoes that tore through the nation's belly on Sunday did not simply kill 39 people, smash hundreds of buildings, and knock out water and power for thousands in eight states. It snatched a wood-frame house with a family of four inside off its foundation in Cherokee County, Kan., and dumped it in a pasture a quarter-mile away, leaving Julie Green, 50, dead in the rubble. It toppled an emergency tower in Jackson, Tenn., and damaged the concrete fountain there memorializing the seven victims of a 1999 twister. It ripped the roof off Wilson's Creek Baptist Church near Battlefield, Mo., as 35 parishioners huddled in the basement praying and singing, ''I've got peace like a river.'' Here in Pierce City, a town of 1,385 on the brink of revival, the storm marched through the historic main street like a horrific parade, leaving the once-picturesque downtown looking like one big demolition site. ''Devastation'' was the first word on many lips as public officials declared states of emergency after what experts said were the worst tornadoes in decades. ''It's a war zone, it's a big fat war zone,'' said Michelle Bacarisse, 42, as she and her mother, Norma, waited for word that it was safe to rescue their inventory of handmade quilts and other crafts from the Thistle, a store they opened here last fall. ''It's like a bombing of Europe.'' Amanda Fager-Maghe, 16, picked up the pieces of her grandmother's life from a mound of debris in Franklin, Kan., where years-old anniversary cards were tangled with a sink pipe and length of lace. Josephine Fager's home had been tossed across the street. Her body had been found down the block. ''You see tornadoes on TV and you see them in movies,'' Amanda said, ''but you don't realize what they can do.'' Randall Moody, who is the pastor of Wilson's Creek and Battlefield's emergency director, lamented the loss of his 1992 Chevrolet Lumina, which had logged more than 200,000 miles of church outings and errands, as well as the new 15,000-square-foot auditorium the church completed in October. ''You could hear everything come apart,'' Mr. Moody recalled of the storm. ''The entire basement was shaking.'' The storms pounded the country's midsection for hours, leaving Louisville, Ky., without lights for the Monday morning rush, flooding parts of Iowa, where 2.83 inches of rain fell in 24 hours, and dropping baseball-size hail in parts of Nebraska and South Dakota, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said. State officials said the tornadoes took 18 lives in Missouri, 14 in Tennessee and 7 in Kansas; no one died in Arkansas, though a woman from Antioch, 50 miles north of Little Rock, was in critical condition after emergency surgery for a head injury. Eleven of Tennessee's deaths were in Madison County, which includes Jackson, a city of 60,000 that is the largest between Memphis and Nashville. The rest of the deaths were sprinkled across three counties in Kansas and eight in Missouri. One man, Dale Taunton, died in the vast destruction here as he stood outside the National Guard Armory, an old stone building where about 40 people sought shelter only to be pummeled by debris as the adjacent gymnasium crumbled. Mr. Taunton, who was in his 50's, worked for the state's agriculture department and was a longtime deacon at the 100-year-old First Baptist Church, where pieces of the ceiling littered the pews this afternoon. Just before the sirens announced the tornado Sunday evening, Mr. Taunton was at the church for a business meeting, sitting in a back row; Saturday night, he had been yukking it up at a weenie roast. ''Big man, not fat, just a big man,'' Les Hagebusch said of his friend and fellow congregant, noting that Mr. Taunton and his wife had recently repainted the church interior. The FEMA director, Michael D. Brown, planned to visit both Missouri and Kansas on Tuesday. In Missouri, the governor has asked that 39 counties be declared federal disaster areas, and in Kansas such a request has been made for seven counties. Speaking in Little Rock, Ark., President Bush said, ''Nature is awfully tough at times, and the best thing we can do right now is to pray for those who have suffered.'' Perhaps no one place was hit as hard as Pierce City, a quaint village of antique shops about 40 miles southwest of Springfield that was about to celebrate its 133rd birthday with a Spring Fling scheduled for May 17. Officials said 40 to 50 homes and all of the town's 40 businesses suffered severe damage, with most being declared a total loss. On Commercial Street, which runs through the town center, shelves full of Pine Sol, Windex and Comet cleaner stood in the open air where the Town and Country grocery store used to be. The entire glass storefront of American Legion Post 65 had blown out, but only one of several dozen paper flags hanging from the walls inside had snapped off. At Archer Antiques, a sign saying, ''You break, you buy,'' was taped to a shelf filled with shards of pottery. ''This was the video store, that one was an antique store,'' said Tom Majors, a member of the City Council who has lived here all of his 56 years, as he toured what looked like a set from a horror movie. ''This over here was an art gallery, pharmacy, American Legion. This corner was the old bank. This was our old bandstand. It'd been here since the 1800's. They just got through putting the new roof on it -- last week, actually.'' Doug Thompson, who has owned the town's pharmacy for 26 years, locked up all the narcotics, covered the liquor bottles and greeting cards in heavy plastic, and promised to reopen in a portable trailer as soon as possible. Scott Rector, whose renovated tea room and gift shop, Freda Mae's, celebrated its first anniversary on May 1, climbed through the broken windows and across a river of debris to remove tubs of scented candles and salvageable furniture, in hopes of reviving his business. ''The physical structure is destroyed, but the human structure is there,'' Gov. Bob Holden said as he surveyed the wreckage. ''We'll come back. We're not the Show-Me State for nothing.'' But many of the newer businesses lacked insurance, and some estimated that they had lost as much $250,000 in inventory. When Governor Holden told Candy Egbert, the owner of a secondhand store, that ''the heart of the people is still here,'' Ms. Egbert responded, ''Not this one. I'm ready to leave.'' ''All I want to do is get away from this,'' she said later. ''I can't stand looking at this right now.'' Tornado sirens gave people here about 20 minutes' warning before the storm struck around 7 p.m. At 203 East Main Street, 11 children and 10 adults were eating cake in honor of Anthony Wilson's seventh birthday. His mother, Patricia Wilson, hurried the children into the basement and covered them with blankets; the adults joined them after a few minutes of weather watching. Mr. Majors, the council member, emerged from his own basement and walked down the block, checking his neighbors' homes. He heard a disabled woman he knows only as Linda yelling for help. ''She laid down on her bed and put her cat on her lap and the bed folded,'' he said. ''That's what kept the whole roof from collapsing.'' Mike Allen was watching ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' on television, and his son, James, was working on the computer, when the power went off. They heard a loud rumbling, and figured it was the train that runs directly behind their storefront apartment, which still has ''The Windsor Room'' awning from when it was a restaurant. Mr. Allen stood in his doorway, waved at his neighbor across the street, and watched the lightning. ''Then I saw like a black wall, I couldn't see the edges of it,'' he recalled. ''It was eating those buildings. It was just ripping them apart and all the pieces up in the air like smoke.'' Mr. Allen and his son hid in the shower off the kitchen, their ears popping, the intense pressure buffeting them from side to side. They heard the buildings on either side of them being flattened. ''We looked at each other, we said, 'Ready?' We thought the whole building was going to go,'' he said. ''We thought this was it, it's all over.'' In fact, ''The Windsor Room'' picture window, falsely advertising ''eclectic lunches'' from its former life as a cafe, did not even crack."
"Sometime later, when this city has finished burying its dead, healing its wounded, restoring power and water and boarding over the shattered windows of buildings that were not leveled -- then, maybe, people here will be able to think about erecting yet another memorial to Jackson's latest tornado victims. With any luck, a new memorial will hold together longer than the one that Jackson dedicated just 19 months ago to remember seven Madison County residents killed in a tornado in January 1999. For the storm that shrieked through here close to midnight on Sunday was so powerful it sent one of the monument's eight massive concrete spheres rolling off its pedestal. That was nothing. Within the few minutes it took for the storm to race through town and off to the northeast, two people in Jackson were dead and nine more, a 7-year-old boy among them, had been killed several miles to the southwest, near the local airport, in a decimated hamlet of tempest-tossed mobile homes and houses called Denmark. At least 66 more were injured. Curtis Love, 50, was working at a homeless shelter near downtown when the storm hit. He caught a glimpse of the funnel in flashes of brilliant light. ''I saw a big black cloud with that proverbial locomotive sound,'' he said. ''There were pale green flashes that looked like green lightning, that I guess were transformers going off. ''It was awesome,'' Mr. Love said. ''It was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.'' In Denmark, survivors and their relatives told a tale of horror and of heroism. Anita Rhodes, weeping as she looked about her at what used to be two double-wide trailers, said her sister-in-law, Rhonda McLaughlin, was in one of them with her two boys when the storm hit. The trailer flipped several times, and the youngest, 7, whose name Ms. Rhodes would not give, was killed. The older child, 15-year-old T. J., got out relatively unhurt, she said. He found his mother in the woods during a calm between the winds, she said, then ''lifted two trees off her and toted her to safety.'' But the winds picked up again first, Ms. Rhodes said, and the boy, his mother in his arms, locked his hands around a concrete pillar to keep the two of them from being blown away. She was being treated at a Memphis hospital, Ms. Rhodes said tonight. The 1999 storm that ravaged Madison County was deadly, but not nearly as devastating. This time, the tornado -- or tornadoes, since no one here is yet sure how many funnel clouds were responsible -- and its softball-size hailstones fairly well wrecked the central business district of the largest city between Memphis and Nashville. Hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed, officials said. Jackson is home to 60,000 people, and a third to half that number, here and elsewhere in the county, were without power and water today, officials said. Water pressure was being restored by early afternoon, but officials said it could be a full day before it was back to normal. Tuesday was the date for municipal elections here, but it appeared likely that the balloting would be postponed. The road leading into Jackson from the interstate was like a ramp leading into hell. In an old cemetery, centuries-old oaks were uprooted and snapped over, their lush leaves now draping tombstones as if to protect them from an earthly nightmare. On the industrial west side, warehouses were peeled open like sardine cans, giant roadside billboards were decapitated. The Budweiser plant was not spared. Only as relief workers and curious area residents crept into the heart of downtown could they glimpse the full measure of the storm's fury. Parking lots looked like junkyards, storefronts were rendered rubbish heaps. Few buildings were left unscathed. Not the Carl Perkins Civic Center, named for the rockabilly legend and native son of Jackson, where the annual Miss Tennessee Pageant is held. Not the state courthouse, where the Tennessee Supreme Court sometimes convenes. Not the new federal courthouse, whose roof was not so much peeled off as flayed, or the century-old, three-story brick building that was converted into a storage center for paper records -- and where the torrent of water cascading from a hole in the third floor did not bode well for those records' survival. Above one block of Liberty Street, shredded blinds hung out of the windows of the battered New Southern Hotel, like leaves from a weeping willow, while along the curb below, the storm had crumpled the signs denoting the reserved parking spaces of county officials. The only one left standing, appropriately enough, was that of the chief building inspector. Opposite the civic center, in Unity Park, where a monument honors the seven victims of the 1999 tornado, one of eight huge concrete spheres was knocked off its pedestal, and an aluminum flagpole honoring victims of the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, was bent to the ground from its roots. By noon today, members of St. Luke's Episcopal Church were salvaging bricks and stacking them on the sidewalk. ''We will rebuild,'' said the pastor, the Rev. Charles Filiatrea. But a few blocks away, behind the civic center, another church was far less fortunate. The Mother Liberty C.M.E. Church, founded in 1848 and rebuilt after a fire in 1893, was razed in its 110th year. Nothing was left standing but the church bell and part of a front wall. As if in a parting miracle, at the densely populated housing project across the street, dozens of windows were blown out, but not a soul was harmed. As the storm screamed into Jackson, Jen Free, 24, a legal assistant, was working on a brief with Joe Byrd, her boss, in their office in the 98-year-old, otherwise sturdy-looking Elks Building. ''We heard the siren, then it stopped five minutes after it started, then it came on again,'' Ms. Free said. Mr. Byrd called his wife and learned the tornado was five minutes away, and the two took refuge inside a vault in the basement of their building, Ms. Free said. When they came out 10 minutes later, all the building's windows were shattered and much of the building itself had been destroyed. The old New Southern Hotel, converted to a home for the elderly, was heavily damaged, but no residents were injured, officials said. Employees heard the warning siren in time to shepherd residents to safety in the building's basement."
"Storms destroyed three buildings and injured six people in Catskill, N.Y., and there were reports of tornadoes and power failures in an evening of severe weather warnings. Peter Kusminsky, chief of the volunteer fire department in Kiskatom, a hamlet in the Town of Catskill in Greene County, said a three-story home had been destroyed, and a total of seven buildings had been damaged. Six people were injured; two were in stable condition last night. A 70-year-old woman was trapped in debris from her mobile home. Several people reported seeing a funnel cloud, he said. Dick Westergard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Albany, said the agency had issued several tornado warnings and tracked clouds with rotational wind speeds of up to 55 knots. He said the storm moved through Sullivan, Ulster, Greene, and Rensselaer Counties in New York."
"The awesome destructive force of tornadoes -- iconized in ''The Wizard of Oz'' and fetishized in ''Twister'' -- has been harnessed by a 65-year-old farmer who, as central casting would have it, hails from Kansas. Frank Polifka, who farms wheat and milo, invented a contraption called the Windhexe, which creates a tornado-force wind within a steel funnel. A contained cyclone, it turns out, is very useful for pulverizing things. Polifka has reduced broccoli to powder. Same with rocks, aluminum cans, shark cartilage, coal, sewage, household garbage and the membranes that line eggshells. Now, with the help of business partners, his machine is being put to use on bigger things. Energy companies in Australia are using it to remove moisture from coal. A garbage-processing plant in Pennsylvania will go online with its Windhexe next month; the machine can turn two tons of trash into one ton of sterile powder. And in November, a North Carolina poultry processor started turning chicken parts into a high-protein powder for use in the manufacture of pet food. Polifka, who made his first Windhexe about 15 years ago, designed his machine to push compressed air through nozzles at the top of the funnel-shaped can. Small deflection plates then force that air to flow in a counterclockwise direction, creating a miniature tornado. Using just a fraction of the energy employed by conventional crushers and dryers, the Windhexe breaks solid material down, increasing its surface area. It then exposes the degraded material to the heat cast off by its air compressors, evaporating any moisture within. David Winsness, an engineer who is working with Polifka to market the invention, envisions a day when every home will have its own Windhexe -- churning loads of household trash and sewage into handfuls of fine powder. These mundane uses don't mean the fearsome twister has lost its mystique. One of the most delicious things about the Windhexe is that theoretically the thing shouldn't work at all. Its compressed-air streams don't have enough energy to crush much of what it pulverizes. But somehow when those air streams are molded into the shape of a tornado, they become supercharged. ''An engineer could not have invented this,'' Winsness says. ''As an engineer, you don't try anything that's theoretically impossible.'' (Polifka has a 12th-grade education.) ''I don't know what it really does,'' admits Polifka, who once tried and failed to photograph the inside of a working Windhexe using strobe lights. ''No one's been able to explain it.'' Eryn Brown"
"A tornado and fierce rainstorms blitzed parts of New Jersey today, knocking down hundreds of trees, damaging businesses and houses and cutting power for thousands of customers in areas already battered by last week's storm. The fast-moving storm rolled across the area in the morning, dropping as much as three inches of rain in some parts of North Jersey and leaving customers without power from Long Island to South Jersey. It blew out of an overcast morning sky, cutting off power to residents who had scoffed at Hurricane Isabel's weak showing. Cars were trapped behind closed electric garage doors, and communities were cut off from each other by downed trees as crews struggled to clear the debris. ''We were prepared for the hurricane,'' said Steve King, deputy emergency management coordinator for Burlington County, N.J. ''This one was actually far worse.'' Bill Goodman, a National Weather Service forecaster at Brookhaven, on Long Island, said the tornado struck Delaware Township in Hunterdon County, where it damaged houses and knocked a small barn into the middle of a road. It was designated an F-1 tornado, the weakest category with winds from 73 to 112 miles per hour. ''You can put the word 'weak' in quotes,'' Mr. Goodman said. He said forecasters were still examining records and inspecting damage. A tornado of comparable intensity also touched down in Narberth, just outside Philadelphia, knocking down trees and wires, the National Weather Service said. Wind damage from the storm system was reported as far north as northwestern Connecticut and Dutchess County in New York. In this Trenton suburb, the storm knocked the roof off a Cadillac dealership and damaged cars and trucks in many neighborhoods. Gov. James E. McGreevey, wearing a police slicker for a news conference on the dealership lot here, said no one in New Jersey was injured in the storms. Roger Melick, who runs a printing business across the street from the Cadillac agency on Olden Avenue in Ewing, said he saw a funnel cloud that seemed to bounce down the highway, touching down to lift the roof off the showroom, and knocking down utility poles one by one. ''They went down, boom, boom, boom, like dominoes falling,'' he said. Liz Kuronen, a movie producer who lives in the adjacent town, Lawrenceville, said from amid the rubble on her street that she was sure her town had also been hit by a tornado. ''I'm from North Carolina and I know what they sound like -- like a freight train,'' Ms. Kuronen said. ''I went straight to the basement.'' Governor McGreevey said that Public Service Electric & Gas lost service to 21,000 customers in Gloucester, Burlington and Mercer Counties, that Conectiv Power Delivery had 5,000 customers without power in Salem and Cumberland Counties, and that Jersey Central Power & Light lost power to about 2,900 customers in North Jersey. On Long Island about 20,000 power customers went dark for a few hours today, said Bert Cunningham, a spokesman for the Long Island Power Authority. Mr. Goodman, the federal forecaster, said winds on Long Island had reached about 40 m.p.h., but Mr. Cunningham pointed out that many trees had been weakened by the hurricane and so needed only a push to fall into the power lines. The power failures complicated the work lives of people who communicate with the office by computer. Scott Shropshire lives in Lawrenceville, but he works from his home for a Long Island bank. ''You just work on paper and pencil until your computer comes back on,'' he said, ''and then you have to make up for the lost time.'' In Delaware Township, the tornado picked up the barn and a chicken coop belonging to Richard and Marjorie Yard, and threw bits from the buildings so far away they could barely be seen from their home. Two snowmobiles that had been in the barn tumbled about 150 feet down a hill, and several old trees, each several feet in diameter, were uprooted, leaving twigs and branches everywhere on the ground. ''Yesterday, there wasn't a thing on this lawn,'' Mrs. Yard said today. ''We just got it all cleaned up from Isabel,'' she said. One of their neighbors, Pat Schuetz, said she did not see the tornado but she felt it. ''I could feel the wind sucking the air out of the room,'' she said."
"Eight people who sought protection from a tornado in the basement of a neighborhood bar were killed on Tuesday when the building collapsed, sending thousands of pounds of debris crashing onto them, officials said on Wednesday. A spokesman for the National Weather Service said that 14 tornadoes had been confirmed in Illinois and that several others were reported in Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska and Oklahoma. But the bulk of the damage was in Utica, a town of about 1,000 90 miles southwest of Chicago. Tom Templeton, the sheriff of LaSalle County, announced Wednesday afternoon that eight bodies had been found at the Milestone Tap, a bar and restaurant that collapsed on Tuesday night. Several people were rescued from the rubble. Rescue crews working on Wednesday night did not expect to find any more victims. The dead included a man and his daughter and ranged in age from 18 to 81. ''The only reason they would have been in the basement was to seek shelter, said Mike Chamness, the senior policy director for the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. Residents with tired red eyes and solemn expressions walked through the wreckage of what had been a picturesque town with a vibrant main street. Clothing, toys and tumbleweeds of pink insulation covered lawns alongside telephone wires, felled trees and demolished cars. Doreen Dettore, 52, who has lived here in her childhood home since the 1950's, stood outside early Wednesday evening and assessed the damage. The house, a plain two-story building with gray siding, had suffered moderate damage. ''It doesn't look as bad, but I don't know if we have structural damage,'' Ms. Dettore said. ''The doors don't close like they used to. Shards of glass are embedded in the walls opposite the window. The chimney must be leaking; oily stuff, maybe tar, is coming down the bedroom wall.'' She added, ''Someone thought the whole roof might have lifted off and flopped back down again.'' Ms. Dettore said she had salvaged pictures but was not sure whether she could salvage the furniture. Jennifer Stoneking, 36, who owns the Utica Hair Company, the main beauty shop in town, cried at the thought of the salon possibly being demolished. Though her shop is intact, nearby buildings are so damaged that her business might have to be leveled too. Despite that prospect she said she was still better off than those who lost loved ones and homes. ''I don't have it as bad as other people,'' Ms. Stoneking said. Lisle Elsbury, 55, said he spent thousands of dollars last summer repairing the brick walls of his tavern, Duffy's. He had hoped to move into an apartment on the second floor. Mr. Elsbury and 12 patrons were inside the tavern when the tornado hit, taking with it a quarter of the east wall along the second floor where he and his wife planned to live. ''It's devastating,'' Mr. Elsbury said. ''We've been trying to renovate what has been a landmark here in Utica.'' ''We were open for business when this happened,'' he said. ''We all went to the basement and let it blow through and do its damage. I didn't hear anything because I was too busy doing a head count. Nothing like this has ever happened before.'' More than 15,000 Illinois residents were without electricity on Tuesday night as utility poles and wiring had to be replaced. Most had power restored by Wednesday. Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich, who visited Utica on Wednesday, declared as disaster areas four Illinois counties, LaSalle, Putnam, Will and Kankakee, making them eligible for state and maybe federal dollars. Though there were no clear monetary estimates of the damage, officials say it is in the millions of dollars. ''This is a very humbling experience,'' the governor said at an afternoon news conference. ''Whatever it takes, we are going to make the investment to help the community and the people who live here.'' The two-story Milestone Tap was by far the most devastated building in Utica, with each floor collapsing onto the basement, where some patrons may have gone to seek shelter, Mr. Chamness said. ''Sometimes, you go according to the book, which in the case of a tornado means getting to the lowest level or an interior room, and things can still turn out tragically,'' Mr. Chamness said. ''You can replace the buildings. What you can't replace is the people who are lost. When you live in a community this small, everybody knows everybody, and it's painful for everyone.'' Dr. Peter Meier, an orthopedic surgeon, was rushed by the police to the bar because rescuers thought a man who was stuck in the rubble might need his leg amputated. The man had a compound fracture, but the leg was saved. Dr. Meier told The Associated Press that firefighters who shimmied into a hole that led to the basement told him the freezer ''created an open space in one area -- that's where people survived.''"
"I live in Rocky Point. In this part of North Carolina, it's not unusual to get hurricanes and tornadoes. On TV, you hear about them hitting everybody else. But it's unusual for one to hit you. That night, I was off from my job at a nursing home. I was in my trailer, where I live alone. It wasn't even raining when I went to bed. When I woke up around 4 Friday morning, the lights in my house were blinking off and on and it was raining. I didn't pay any attention. I went to the bathroom, and when I came out, I heard something hit. My whole house started trembling. I got into my bathtub for cover. My trailer just started shaking and rocking, as if the wind was going to pick it right up off the ground. It lasted about 30 seconds. Then it was quiet. Everything was completely dark. I ran to the window. I couldn't see anything, but I heard a woman yelling for help. I'm a certified nursing assistant. I have CPR training, and I can tend to wounds. But I was really scared to go outside because I couldn't see. If there are power lines down and the electricity hasn't been cut off, you can be electrocuted. I called 911. When I hung up with them, I called my mom. She wanted me to stay inside because there could have still been big pieces of debris blowing around out there. About five minutes later, I saw a light outside. It was my neighbor Leon Canady and his son standing at the door with flashlights. They came over 'cause they had thought it was me screaming. But once they saw I was fine, they went to find the woman who was crying. I stayed inside, terrified. They found the lady. Later on, Leon told me she was just standing there screaming for help in the middle of her mobile home. But it wasn't actually a mobile home. It was in pieces. The steps up to the house were all that was left. When they found her, she was looking for her babies. She and her boyfriend had three kids. Leon and his son went over to try to help her boyfriend. He was pinned under a wall. They are pretty strong, two grown men, but they couldn't lift the wall and pull him out too. The boyfriend had one of the kids in his arms. He had been trying to save his children. All three made it. The boyfriend didn't. Not too long after that the emergency vehicles came and brought this huge light that lighted up the whole neighborhood. I went out in the street. The lines were down, but the electric company had cut all the power off. I tried to go to my mom's house, half a mile away, but the roads were blocked with debris. When the rescuers came looking for survivors, they asked me how many people lived in the trailer next door. I work 70 hours a week, so I don't get to know a lot of people in the neighborhood. Besides working at night, I do private duty for elderly people during the day. Mostly it's just, I come in, I wave, the neighbors wave and I go on in the house. Our street has real friendly people -- black, Hispanic, white. Everybody just gets along fine. But we never really talk. You know how they always say you're not supposed to be a nosy neighbor? I believe that. What you do in your house is your business. But this is one time I wish I had been a nosy neighbor. Because when the rescuers asked me how many people lived next door, I couldn't tell them. I hated that. The two homes in front of me are going to have to be torn down. The house to the right of mine was destroyed. But my house stood up very well. Barely a scratch on it. When I purchased my trailer, I was told that it was designed to hold up in more-than-130-mile-per-hour winds. The weather guy later said the tornado was doing 130 miles per hour when it touched down in my area. I wasn't lucky; I was blessed. I know God had a lot to do with me surviving. I sure don't know why I was saved and other people were not. I don't know why other people's houses are down, but I know what he did for me. On Saturday, I went right back to work. Basically, I'm fine except for one thing. It's just when I go to sleep at night, all I can hear is that lady hollering for help, and then I see them putting her boyfriend in a body bag. If I had it to do over again, I would probably do it a lot differently. I would go outside and try to find her. I haven't seen her since that night. But when I do see her, the first thing I'm going to do is ask if there's anything she needs, because, you know, she's got three small kids. Several people in the community stood at the side of the road and collected money for the people who lost everything. Everybody keeps telling me how blessed I am that my house is still standing. It's been strange going back to my neighborhood. Right now, I can't live in my house until the inspector comes and says it's safe. I think it will be scary to go back at first. Most of the time when I came out of the house at night, my neighbors always had their lights on. Now there's nothing but darkness. It's going to be lonesome. LIVES"
