"An on-again, off-again project to install a radar to protect planes landing at Kennedy Airport from wind shear is off again, at least temporarily. This time the problem is wind. The Federal Aviation Administration spent 10 years looking for a place to put the radar, a 37-foot ball atop an 82-foot tower. Residents in North Bellmore and East Hills on Long Island did not want it in their neighborhoods. They were backed by Alfonse M. D'Amato, then senator, who favored giving a Long Island company a contract to develop a new type of radar. The F.A.A. waited for Mr. D'Amato to leave office. In 1999, the agency proposed using 1.8 acres it owned at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, but the field was within the Gateway National Recreation Area, and the Interior Department, which runs it, objected. At one point, guards from the National Park Service turned away F.A.A. workers who were trying to take soil samples. It took the intercession of the White House to win approval. By then, the radar was sitting in crates in a Boston warehouse. The F.A.A. had installed more than 40 others nationwide, in hopes of preventing crashes like the 1975 crash at Kennedy that killed 113 people and similar accidents in Dallas and Charlotte, N.C. The Kennedy job was supposed to be simple. Construction began in January 2000, and was to be completed by Nov. 1, 2000. But a windstorm last June damaged the radome, the ball on the tower, and the F.A.A. had trouble finding replacement parts, according to Paul Turk, a spokesman for the agency. The radar has yet to run, but Mr. Turk said that everything is scheduled to be finished by July. ''I agree with you; it seems like a long time,'' he said."
"Windy and dry conditions were blamed yesterday on sporadic brush fires that burned more than 500 acres in New Jersey, with the worst damage in Middlesex and Cumberland Counties. According to the Associated Press, 550 acres had burned and dozens of homes had been evacuated by late last night. No injuries were reported and a spokesman for the State Police said he knew of no major highway closings.The largest of the fires, in Old Bridge, charred at least 100 acres."
"Firefighters in East Rutherford, N.J., battled a brush fire in the Meadowlands yesterday that sent plumes of smoke several miles into the sky and disrupted commuter traffic for several hours in one of the country's busiest transportation corridors. A similar grass fire had had much the same effect on Sunday. Just after noon yesterday, the marshlands near Route 3 and the New Jersey Turnpike began burning, forcing the closing of the busy 16W southbound ramp on the turnpike. Ashes apparently traveled as far as the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The fire was extinguished by late afternoon, and the turnpike ramp was reopened, the East Rutherford Police Department said. No one was injured in the two fires, or in several others throughout the state that have set more than 1,000 acres ablaze in the last few days. But the fires served as reminders that while spring's sunshine has brought blooms and new growth, the lack of rain in the last few weeks has also left large parcels of open land vulnerable to the smallest spark. ''It's dry out there,'' said John Eckrote, deputy chief of the North Hudson Regional Fire and Rescue squad, which fought the Sunday fire. ''The grass out there is last year's grass, standing tall, maybe 5 feet tall, all individual leaves of this saw grass, and it's dry. The new grass hasn't kicked in yet.'' Mr. Eckrote said members of his squad had spent most of their time on the perimeter of the fire, trying to contain it and to keep it from swallowing up homes or other buildings. They tried not to go into the Meadowlands. ''It's not safe,'' he said. ''The distances are so great, there are no access roads. It's dangerous out there in the meadows with sinkholes and potholes.'' The deputy chief also said investigators believed that the fire had been caused by a tossed cigarette. He warned that even though the region is densely populated, there are pockets of vulnerable terrain. Every year around this time, he said, fires are accidentally started in northern New Jersey, the Palisades or the forests in South Jersey. In Cumberland County, about 760 acres of forest started burning early Saturday, and by yesterday afternoon a few areas were still smoldering, said Charles Seiferman, a firefighter with the city of Millville. The fire was in Millville and also in nearby Laurel Lakes, and extended into a state game reserve. The New Jersey Forest Fire Service came in to help fight the fire, the cause of which is still under investigation, Mr. Seiferman said. Around 50 people in the Laurel Lake area were evacuated on Saturday but were allowed to return the next day, he said. No one was hurt, and no buildings were affected by the forest fires. ''The woods down in this section of the state are a tinderbox,'' said Mr. Seiferman, who spent 12 hours fighting the fire. ''They're just waiting to burn. Everything's so dry.''"
"The popularity of women's tennis is growing, television exposure has expanded and the stars are finding endorsement opportunities previously reserved for male athletes, but one choreographer of the tour's rejuvenation is walking away. Bart McGuire has decided to resign as chief executive of the Women's Tennis Association at the end of the year. With the Tour's office consolidation expected to be completed in 2002 -- which will move the headquarters from Stamford, Conn., to a site to be determined in the Southeast -- McGuire cited family and personal reasons for not wanting to relocate. ''I never looked at this as a lifetime job,'' McGuire said when reached in his office yesterday. ''I thought it was important to come in with the Tour struggling and help get it on a positive track.'' McGuire took over as chief executive in January 1998. At that time, the prize money was flat, players were disgruntled with the inequity of purses at major events, and the Tour's title sponsor had declined to renew. Over the past three years, McGuire has negotiated major sponsorship deals and increased revenue, prize money and exposure. This year, the Tour is on pace to break attendance records. ''Bart was instrumental in pulling the Tour out of a very difficult situation in his first years in office,'' Billie Jean King, a founder of the WTA, said in a statement. ''In many areas, he has helped to break new ground for the Tour.'' As noted as McGuire has been for his business savvy over the past three years, he has had his detractors. He has been criticized for the sex-appeal strategy behind the Tour's successful marketing plan to attract fringe tennis fans. And McGuire has been viewed as too passive in handling the brush fires that have erupted on the Tour, including the problems created by uncontrollable tennis parents and the string of last-minute injury exits by Venus and Serena Williams. Inside the sport, officials said there was an undercurrent of dissatisfaction toward McGuire within the Tour's board of directors when he was unable to negotiate a national television package. Officials called the disappointment in McGuire unfair because such a deal is difficult to seal when so many tournaments are independently owned. ''I've made no secret of the fact that we'll all be better off when we have a greater degree of centralization,'' McGuire said. ''One of the challenges you face in this industry is to get everyone pulling in the same direction. It's not always easy. ''The fact that we didn't get done everything on the wish list was not a reason for giving in.'' McGuire said there was no pressure put on him by the board to terminate his five-year contract a year before it expired. To McGuire and his family, this was a common-sense issue. His wife, Cindy, spends a great deal of her time at the couple's home on the West Coast. McGuire, who graduated from Princeton in 1962 and Columbia Law School in 1965, has East Coast roots that go beyond his WTA office in Connecticut. Already physically taxed by the cross-country commutes, McGuire was not interested in relocating to the Southeast for a year. ''From the start, I was going to stay through next year at the max,'' McGuire said. ''I always had the right to terminate the deal at any time with three months' notice. I think everyone felt that this was the best time for a transition.'' In the eight months before he leaves his post, McGuire will continue his work in adding major partnerships to the Tour, and he will be chairman of the search committee for a new chief executive. ''I've always thought you should leave a position two years before you stop enjoying it, not two years after you've stopped enjoying it,'' he said. ''I think that's important.'' TENNIS"
"With wildfires raging in Florida and Nevada and forecasters predicting another big fire season, federal agencies are bolstering their firefighting lineups to avoid a repeat of last year's devastating blazes across the nation. The National Fire Plan, financed by a $1.78 billion Congressional appropriation late last year, will add nearly 7,000 jobs to firefighting efforts by the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service, an agency of the Department of Agriculture. The positions will improve the government's response to wildfires and ensure that fire resources are kept at ''maximum efficiency'' for years to come, officials said. ''Our focus is to ensure that we are prepared to meet the challenges of protecting communities and landscapes from the wrath of wildland fire,'' Secretary of the Interior Gale A. Norton said last week. Ms. Norton plans to meet with Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado on Tuesday to discuss the National Fire Plan and fire preparedness. The new positions include seasonal smoke jumpers, engine crewmen and frontline support fighters, or hotshots. Before this year's hiring surge, federal opportunities for entry-level firefighters had been on the decline for years, said Forest Service veterans like Rex Holloway, a spokesman for the Pacific Northwest region of the Forest Service in Portland, Ore. ''With the Forest Service, we have been in a downsizing mode'' the past few years, Mr. Holloway said, ''and have not been hiring a lot of people.'' As a result, many federal firefighting crews lacked the young, skilled workers needed to sustain peak performance in the long term. ''The work force has stayed static, and not only that, people are retiring,'' said Mike Daluz, a former hotshot crewman now in charge of fire operations in the Rocky Mountain region, which includes Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and eastern Wyoming. The average staff member of Mr. Daluz's agency is now 46 years old. Excluding new employees, the Forest Service estimates that more than half of its workers will retire by 2011. The problem reached a peak last year, Mr. Daluz said, when extreme fire conditions and a lack of experienced people hampered the ability of some crews to respond to fires during the worst fire season in more than 90 years. The fires spread over nearly 10,800 square miles. During catastrophic fire seasons, he said, even a glut of seasonal workers without proper leadership ''means we may not be there in a timely way.'' But last season's fires sounded the national alarm, and within months, federal money was set aside to improve the system. ''Starting last spring with the Los Alamos fire, and then almost nightly as people were seeing images of large fires, it became a bipartisan effort'' to add the resources to help reshape the national firefighting strategy, said Lyle Laverty, the Forest Service's coordinator for the National Fire Plan. ''I think we are doing very well,'' Mr. Laverty said, adding that 4,894 of the 5,000 new Forest Service positions had been filled. ''I cannot recall any point in our agency's history that we hired as many people in one short window as we are now.''"
"Despite several days of rain, brush fires that have consumed hundreds of thousands of drought-parched acres in Florida continued to burn today throughout the state. The rains have diminished the fires' most noxious problem, thick smoke from burning lakebeds and swamplands that have been dried out by a drought now in its fourth year. The dried mud has been a tar-like fuel, producing smoke that closed major roads, including Interstate 4 across the state, and smothered theme parks, including Walt Disney World. The smoke was blamed for several crashes. The worst of the accidents was a 20-vehicle pile-up on Sunday that killed a supermarket executive and injured several other people. Even after the swamps stop burning, they pour out smoke. ''It's like your charcoal grill,'' said Timothy Crawshaw, a spokesman at the Florida Division of Forestry. ''When you get done cooking, it's still smoldering.'' Gov. Jeb Bush watched an aerial assault this afternoon on the 61,000-acre Mallory Swamp fire near Tallahassee, which has been burning for two and one-half weeks. It is the worst of the 20 brush fires still burning. Since January, there have been 3,000 wildfires, which have burned over 266,000 acres. Unlike the fires in 1998, which scorched 504,000 acres, this year's blazes have not threatened heavily populated areas. Still, the more remote areas in which they are burning have more people than in the past few years because of development. ''People don't have defensible space between their homes and the wooded area,'' said Chris Kintner, a Lakeland spokeswoman for the Division of Forestry. ''They have homes that are hard to defend, because of the narrow driveways and firefighters can't gain access quickly.'' ''There are more swamp areas that they've developed,'' Ms. Kintner added. ''They're looking for country living without the realization that Florida woodlands like to burn.'' Terrence McElroy, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, said, ''As Florida has urbanized, it has made our life more complicated.'' Mr. McElroy said the terrain had made many of the fires harder to fight. ''It is highly volatile and the underbrush and bog make it very difficult to move equipment,'' he said. Ground crews have been aided by helicopters and aircraft dropping water. About 500 firefighters, including some from four other states and the National Guard, have dug nearly 100 miles of trenches around this swamp fire, which was sparked by lightning. Several earlier fires were attributed to arsonists. The cost of firefighting has run into several million dollars, and federal assistance from the United States Department of Agriculture and the Federal Emergency Management Agency is expected to offset some of those costs. The National Weather Service has forecast afternoon showers for the rest of the week, and the long-term outlook for rain is expected to help relieve the worsening drought. ''Over the next couple of weeks, it will substantially diminish the wildfire threat,'' said Andy Devanas, meteorologist for the Florida Division of Emergency Management."
"The plan to build a World War II Memorial on the Mall was sent back to the drawing board today after a powerful government planning group voted to reconsider both the location and the design of the $100 million-plus project. The 11 members of the group, the National Capital Planning Commission, decided unanimously today essentially to start over. The group's approval is required for the project. ''We have decided to review the entire matter,'' Richard L. Friedman, the commission chairman, said in a telephone interview. ''We are going to review it from square one.'' Asked whether the location and the design were now up in the air, Mr. Friedman, who heads a national real estate development firm in Massachusetts, said, ''Reluctantly, that is correct.'' Ever since President Bill Clinton approved the site for the memorial, between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, in 1995, the project has faced fierce criticism and outright opposition, though it has broad support from leading veterans organizations, many members of Congress and Hollywood figures like Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. Advocates of the memorial expressed confidence that despite the new setback, the memorial would be built. ''I know that the will of several Congresses, two presidents and the American people honoring our World War II generation will ultimately prevail,'' said Representative Marcy Kaptur, Democrat of Ohio, who introduced legislation to build the memorial. Opponents say the memorial, if built as planned, would destroy one of the most symbolic vistas in America: the stretch of the Mall from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial. Critics call the design of the 7.4-acre project an aesthetic travesty, contending that its giant sunken stone plaza and reflecting pool, 56 17-foot-tall commemorative pillars, 2 four-story triumphal arches, gold stars, monumental bronze eagles, bronze wreaths and fountains are reminiscent of Nazi architecture. Mr. Friedman, probably best known as the Martha's Vineyard host of the Clintons, was appointed chairman by Mr. Clinton last December for a term that ends in 2005. He now finds himself in the midst of a battle not of his own making. He emphasized that the entire matter could be resolved by Congress, a solution he favors. ''Congress could clarify the issue and moot the question by saying that the commission's actions were in fact valid,'' Mr. Friedman said. The commission announced that it would review all six of its previous approvals made over the last six years. It has scheduled special public hearings on June 13 and 14 to allow proponents and opponents of the project to speak before the commission votes again on the project. The commission also plans to convene a panel of leading architects and urban designers for a daylong public hearing this month to assess the wisdom and feasibility of the project. ''I want the best brains in the business to help us through this process,'' Mr. Friedman said at today's public meeting. And the commission today asked the National Park Service to construct a life-size model of the memorial at the proposed site, as it has done with other memorial projects, to help decide whether the memorial would be an architectural mistake in the heart of Washington. After today's vote, the World War II Veterans to Save the Mall, an organization that has opposed the current plan, issued a statement praising the action, saying, ''The commission's decision to reconsider the site of the proposed memorial is an encouraging sign that the agency is listening to the public on this important issue, and is responding.'' Today's decision follows questions raised by the Justice Department in court last month about the validity of decisions made by the commission after the term of the previous chairman, Harvey Gantt, expired. In his two terms, Mr. Gantt often voted in support of the memorial, and he cast the deciding vote when the commission approved the memorial's design and reaffirmed its support for the site last September."
"For 18 days now, Steven Alcorn has been patrolling 765 acres of smoldering, blackened woodland here in a bright red Dodge truck crammed with hoses, axes, shovels and a 250-gallon water tank and pump. He even displays a sign out back with Smokey Bear's timeworn plea: ''Prevent Forest Fires!'' As a fire warden for the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, Mr. Alcorn stops to check for smoke that could signal a new blaze. But increasingly, nervous residents in this small manufacturing city in southern New Jersey flag him down for reassurance. After all, his job is to protect their neighborhoods from the brush fires that have been scorching the state for weeks. Mr. Alcorn's truck rolled noisily to a stop this afternoon after Margaret Jean Frishkorn waved at him from her front lawn. She called him a guardian angel and confided that she listened for his truck to come rumbling down her road every night before falling asleep. ''It's very scary,'' said Mrs. Frishkorn, 61, pointing to a thin haze of smoke rising nearby. ''I'm living on the edge of death. I can be wiped out just like that.'' Mr. Alcorn, 34, grinned reassuringly. ''Ah, we're not going to let that happen,'' he said. And so far, he hasn't. In the last month, an unusual stretch of hot, dry weather and gusting winds has created fire hazards throughout the New York metropolitan region. In New Jersey alone, firefighters have battled 550 brush fires, including one in Millville on April 28, the largest here in recent years, that continues to smolder in a hard-to-reach swamp. Then, on Monday night, another brush fire burned 35 acres here, as similar fires blackened parts of Long Island. Mr. Alcorn kicked at clumps of charred grass and leaves with his sturdy boots. ''Right now, it's pretty barren,'' he said. ''Like somebody dropped an atom bomb here.'' While campfires and charcoal grills have been banned in many areas as a precaution, Mr. Alcorn and others say that only a thorough drenching -- at least an inch or two of rain -- can extinguish the smoldering fires once and for all and ease the minds of those who live here. Until then, he and others like him must patrol around the clock because any spark could set off a firestorm. It has been 25 days since any measurable rain has fallen in the region, according to Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. That ties a record, set in 1942, when no rain fell from April 11 to May 5. University meteorologists forecast a chance of showers on Friday, but said any relief would be too brief to lift the fire danger, which is compounded by uncommonly low humidity and dry vegetation that acts as tinder. Mr. Alcorn, a native of Millville, grimaced as he scanned the blue sky this afternoon. The long hours on patrol have disrupted his life in countless ways. Residents call his home late into the night to report smoke. He can no longer eat dinner in a restaurant without being interrupted. And his wife, Nancy, left for vacation in California this week without him. ''It's more of a lifestyle than a career,'' said Mr. Alcorn, who earns about $45,000 a year and also volunteers at the Millville Fire Department. ''It gets a little tedious, but I love what I do. I don't think you can get a better job than this.'' And does Mrs. Alcorn love his job too? ''It does get to be a pain,'' he admitted. ''But she understands. She knew that about me when she married me, so she better not complain.'' Mrs. Alcorn, 32, agreed that she no longer groused much about her husband's firefighting when she called him from California later in the day. ''I'm used to it now,'' she said. ''You learn to do things on your own. You learn not to plan dinner, and if you do, you eat alone.'' Even Mr. Alcorn has grown tired lately of fighting blazes that never seem to end. On Sunday, he arranged for a plane to dump 44 buckets, each containing 325 gallons of lake water, on the smoldering woodland in the swamp. ''It didn't even put a dent in it,'' he said with frustration. ''I just want this thing to go away. I've had enough.'' But Mr. Alcorn cannot park his big red truck just yet. ''There's a lot more that could still burn,'' he said, ''and in a lot worse areas where we could lose homes very quickly.''"
"A little more than a year after the worst wildfire in New Mexico history, the National Park Service issued a report yesterday that recommends against disciplining any park service employees who started the fire as a prescribed burn. Instead, the report lays the blame on ''errors in judgment'' and federal policies that were followed by the employees in May 2000 when they set out to burn 1,000 acres of underbrush in Bandelier National Monument in northern New Mexico. Dry, windy conditions pushed the fire toward the city of Los Alamos and the Los Alamos National Laboratory, burning more than 42,000 acres and 400 homes before it was contained. Prescribed burns are used routinely in many areas to destroy brush and prevent larger, catastrophic fires that can occur when lightning strikes. ''It is clear that the principals involved with the fire carried out their actions with the full expectation that they would succeed, and were within the parameters of policy, guidelines and regulations to prescribed fire burns, on the day of ignition,'' the federal board of inquiry wrote in its conclusion. ''After-the-fact review indicated that there were errors in judgment and planning that may have led to the escape of the fire.'' Representative Tom Udall, whose Congressional district covers the area of the Cerro Grande fire, faulted the report on Monday before it was made public. In a statement, Mr. Udall said that the report raised more questions than it answered. ''I find it hard to believe,'' he said, ''that after this massive fire, which essentially shut down a community and cost millions in damage, that no one is held accountable. Didn't someone make a mistake? We have to ask ourselves if this action recommended is really fair to the victims of this tragedy.'' Mr. Udall added that he intended to contact Gale A. Norton, the secretary of the interior, to discuss his concerns. He also noted that millions of dollars in federal aid for the fire victims could be affected because the aid was approved ''on the premise that the disaster was the fault of the federal government.'' Karen Wade, regional director of the National Park Service in Denver, said the blame was not limited to one person. ''It is the fault of the federal government, the fault of this agency,'' Ms. Wade said. ''I have to disagree that there is any one person to blame. It was weaknesses in policies and procedures.'' The report is actually dated Feb. 26, but it was not released until this week so Bush administration officials could review it. The park service board of inquiry contradicts many findings of earlier reports, including one by the United States General Accounting Office, which concluded that park officials misread the fire-danger conditions when the fire was set. Roy Weaver, the superintendent of the national monument, retired last June after taking blame for the fire. Today in comments to reporters, Mr. Weaver said he agreed with the findings of this latest report. ''We met all that was expected of us under those circumstances, and decisions were made based on the best information we had available at the time,'' Mr. Weaver said. The report recommended additional training, education and recertification for some employees, and most harshly criticized Mike Powell, who was in charge of the burn. Part of the problem, the report said, was with the ''complexity rating'' available on a park service Web site. The rating provides numbers to assess the challenge of fires in specific terrain. In this case, an incorrect rating form was posted on the agency site. The report said that Mr. Powell, who now works at a different monument, did not staff the fire properly,recommended that he undergo recertification to supervise fires. The Los Alamos County administrator, Mary McInerny, said victims of the fire simply wanted to move ahead rather than figure out who was at fault. She said that at least 60 families still needed permanent housing and that there was still much construction and utility work to be done over the summer. ''Hopefully, we'll learn from our mistakes, not dwell on the past, and get on with our lives,'' Ms. McInerny said."
"There has been little positive to say so far about the environmental policies of Interior Secretary Gale Norton and Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman, neither of whom seems to care much about giving this country's natural resources, especially its forests, the protection they need. But both deserve credit for accepting, albeit under some duress, the basic elements of the Clinton administration's strategy for preventing forest fires. Although repackaged as President Bush's own ''10-year plan,'' it is essentially the same sensible approach agreed to by Western governors and Congress in the wake of last summer's disastrous fires, which consumed 6.7 million acres. The strategy relies on two main techniques -- fires deliberately set to reduce combustible underbrush and shrubs, known as controlled burns, and the ''thinning'' of overgrown forests by removing the smallest, most fire-prone trees while leaving the largest, most fire-resistant ones behind. Indeed, the strategy clearly rejects the scientifically insupportable notion, favored by the logging industry and its retainers in Washington, that aggressive commercial logging decreases fires. The plan gives states and communities considerable oversight. The administration had sought greater federal control, but local communities and conservationists feared that ''thinning'' would be used to justify widespread commercial logging. They were right to object. Any firefighting strategy should be tailored to local needs, not the ambitions of the logging industry."
"Forest fires have raged across the hills and valleys of most Western states this summer, burning millions of acres, consuming homes and claiming the lives of nine firefighters. With three months left in this year's fire season and drought a problem in many places, the danger is high. Last year, a record 8.4 million acres burned. While officials debate how best to respond to the danger -- by clearing out forests, for example, or allowing controlled fires -- the task of tackling the blazes is left to crews of young men and women like those in these photographs. The Star Fire, in the Tahoe and Eldorado National Forests in California, shown here, is not a threat to houses or towns. For most people in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada east of Sacramento, the smoke is the main irritant. Yet the fire, in rugged terrain, has grown since it started a week ago to cover about 10,500 acres, and it is not expected to be fully contained until late this week. On the fire lines, with only limited satellite telephone service set up by the Forest Service and a few spots where cell telephone signals can get through, everyone is cut off. The more than 2,000 firefighters battling the blaze come from all over the West. Some pitch tents and others roll out sleeping bags wherever they happen to drop after 14-hour shifts to sleep under the smoke-obscured stars. Crews are made up of college students and veterans. About 200 state prison inmates are also helping fight the Star Fire. For the federal government crews, the fire season means a life of 14-hour days, 14 days on and two days off, with crews jumping from one fire to the next. They carry backpacks with standard safety equipment and they wear fire-retardant clothing made of Nomex, helmets and goggles. On a fire like this one, down a canyon that could become a death trap, the crews mainly pick defensible lines called firebreaks like roads to contain the fire. A crew of about 20 members brushes the firebreak area of potential fuel like dead branches. Two crew members handle the chain saws, while the others rush the deadwood down the road to the safe side, with no time to spare."
"With a coyote roaming Central Park, celebrity news filling Manhattan blogs, and a Trader Joe's market opening near Union Square, New York City has a lot in common with Southern California these days. But now it shares something else: brush fires. That stock calamity of Western life -- and star of aerial cable news footage from June to November in California -- has broken out across the city this year in numbers and intensity rarely seen. From Jan. 1 through March 15, a total of 93 blazes scorched grassland around the city, making it one of New York's busiest brush-fire seasons on record. Last year, during the same period, there were 16. This week, a two-alarm fire burned in Great Kills Park on Staten Island, where last week, a five-alarm fire raged for four hours, threatening nearby homes. Early Sunday, a two-alarm fire burned in Spring Creek Park in Queens, opposite a residential block in Howard Beach. ''I opened the door and got thrown back by the heat,'' said Allen Nadler, whose modern, salmon-colored home on 78th Street faced the fire, which began around midnight and was fanned by strong gusts. A few days later, the burned park in Queens looked like a charred no man's land, as any burned brush would, except that it was peppered with the detritus of city life -- a melted steel drum and shards of beer bottles that had burst in the conflagration. The cause of that fire and many of the others is not known, but a chief suspicion is that they were man-made. Officials suspect either a serial arsonist or accidental fire starters, in the form of a child hiding in the reeds to smoke a first cigarette, or a teenager riding a spark-spitting moped. Homeless people cooking food could also be responsible. Beyond possible arson, Chief Salvatore Cassano, the Fire Department's chief of operations, blamed the very dry winter with a lot of windy days. He said winter and early-spring brush fires in New York City were an annual phenomenon, though seldom in this quantity. ''This is no surprise to the New York City Fire Department,'' he said, noting that there were open spaces with overgrown grasses and marshy wetlands filled with dead reeds in each borough, except Manhattan. ''In light of the dry winter with the windy conditions,'' he added, ''whatever moisture was on the brush has evaporated.'' Of course, the fires that have burned this year in the marshes and parkland in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and even the Bronx are much smaller than rampaging infernos like the Cedar Fire in San Diego County in 2003, in which 273,000 acres burned. In other parts of the country, at least 11 people were killed and more than 650,000 acres burned in Texas just this month, and fires have been known to burn in the Alaskan wilderness for six months at a stretch. In the largest New York brush fire this year, the five-alarm fire on March 11 in Great Kills Park on Staten Island, 75 acres burned. The second largest brush fire, also on Staten Island, a four-alarm blaze in Ocean Breeze Park on March 15, burned 25 acres. All of this year's brush fires were brought under control within several hours and without loss of life. Though smaller, they nevertheless pose the same threat to homes and lives as their Western counterparts -- especially in a wind-whipped city built on a tight grid, with many neighborhoods lying close to marshes. Commanders have adapted firefighting techniques to battle the blazes. The burning area is divided into four quadrants, and firefighters try to flank it to bring it under control. Because large water tanks and hoses often cannot reach into the burning area, firefighters from brush-fire units strap on small metal tanks, which weigh more than 40 pounds and hold five gallons of water, and head into the brush to spray the fire directly. ''It's very tough duty,'' Chief Cassano said of the work, which includes walking through thick reeds or over embers and often sinking knee-deep into mud. Adrian Benepe, the city's parks commissioner, said restoring wetlands and replanting native species like cattails and other grasses would reduce the number of fires. ''What's burning is dead phragmites -- it's last year's growth,'' Mr. Benepe explained, speaking about the tall tan stalks that clog much of Spring Creek Park and other wetlands in the city. ''It's an introduced plant that's heavily colonized New York City. They out-compete native vegetation.'' Mr. Nadler, the Howard Beach resident whose home faces the charred ground of Spring Creek Park, said there used to be more fires, before the city covered over the contaminated marsh soil about two decades ago. This week, despite the burn, stumps of reeds could be seen poking through the soil, foreshadowing more growth, and more fires to come. News of the increase in brush fires in New York caused some amusement on the fire-branded left coast. ''Brush fires -- in New York City?'' asked Michael Jarvis, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Services, which puts out several hundred thousand acres of brush fires each year. Some perspective: In California, all brush fires get names. In New York, they rarely do. And what seems Dante-esque here is minor there. A recent fire near Sacramento burned several thousand acres and consumed three houses but never registered as a major fire, Mr. Jarvis said. ''I've heard of fires out in Ohio where 600 acres of marshland burns,'' he said, ''but not in New York.''"
"DURING the first three months of this year, more than 90 brush fires scorched parts of New York City. In March alone, nearly 200 acres of Staten Island park and brush land were lost to the flames. Though brush fires are dismissed by some observers as a Western phenomenon, climatological evidence points to a different and far more disturbing conclusion. While arson, one of the leading causes of wildfires in the West, is certainly no stranger to the city, global warming is bringing drier weather and increasing winds to the Northeast. High winds can superheat already dry grasses and brush, in effect preheating the landscape. As a result, the smallest brush fire can become a city-devouring inferno. The big question then is this: Are New York City firefighters ready to battle these fires? Is the city prepared for them? The United States Forest Service and other agencies train firefighters to contain brush fires rather than confront them. It's fire fighting at arm's length. Firefighters try to prevent a brush fire's spread with things like trenches and backfires, which burn off the vegetation ahead of the blaze and deny it the fuel it needs. These tactics allow the firefighters space and time to flee if the fire moves in their direction. In cities, however, fire services are trained to protect property and rescue victims trapped in buildings, and that requires firefighting hand to hand. The urban firefighter depends on bringing heavy equipment like pumps and tower ladders as close to the fire as possible to knock it down with streams of water. But a brush fire moves too fast to reposition heavy equipment, often cutting off the retreat. In April 1963, the New York Fire Department got a taste of this as wildfires raged on Staten Island, moving so quickly that the firefighters could not reposition their engines quickly enough, nor find sufficient water to put out all the spot fires. No one was killed, but the Fire Department now has brush fire units, with special training and a few pieces of special equipment, but this is not enough. Every member of the New York Fire Department should be trained in how to handle brush fires. On Oct. 20, 1991, firefighters in the San Francisco Bay area learned the importance of training everyone when a wildfire broke out in the hills above Oakland. While the fire departments in Oakland and Berkeley were highly professional, they did not have brush fire training. For the 30,000 residents who fled and the hundreds of firefighters at the scene, it was a hellacious day. What made matters worse was that a brush fire burning beneath the surface of an empty lot reignited while firefighters were still digging out the embers from the first fire. Only the wind dying down and then shifting allowed the firefighters to return and overhaul the burned area. The fire killed 25 people who could not escape their housing and apartment complexes and caused more than $2.1 billion in damage to a five-and-a-half mile perimeter. Just as in this spring in New York City, the conditions in Oakland in October 1991 were ripe for serious wildfires: high wind, dry weather and combustible debris carelessly disposed of by homeowners and commercial users. Had similar conditions whipped a brush fire through, say, Queens or Brooklyn, the losses would have been far greater. Sadly, our cities have not taken the dangers of brush fire seriously. When cities were less densely populated, open spaces, empty lots and park lands served as natural fire breaks. Many of our early cities, like Philadelphia and Savannah, Ga., were designed around this concept, with large squares left free of buildings to prevent urban fires from becoming city-eating conflagrations. While the timbered houses were more flammable than the concrete, tile and steel of modern apartment buildings, they were only two or three stories high so that residents could escape fire more easily. Now, and especially in New York City, we have traded the safety of a dispersed urban population for the danger of heavily occupied skyscrapers, trusting in modern fireproofing. As we learned on Sept. 11, however, newer building codes are more lenient when it comes to fire prevention. Spray-on flame retardants don't provide the safety of the thickened concrete and fireproof tile that was required in the 1938 building code, the product of years of experience with skyscraper fires. The World Trade Center was essentially a high-rise fire trap waiting for a brush fire to climb its walls and scourge its interior. Had the blazes in the towers been treated as vertical wildfires instead of as conventional building fires, the lives of hundreds of firefighters may have been saved. When conditions for a serious wildfire are present, the National Weather Service hoists a red warning flag. Residents in the fire area are supposed to be ready for evacuation and fire services are required to prepare for an inferno. But who in the city knew that on March 15, the National Weather Service issued such a warning for the New York City region? Who was ready to evacuate? Who knew what routes to take, or what preparations to make? The impact of a wildfire could easily equal the impact of a storm like Hurricane Katrina, and we would be just as unprepared and as culpable for its catastrophic results. The City Peter Charles Hoffer, a history professor at the University of Georgia, is the author of the forthcoming ''Seven Fires: The Urban Infernos That Reshaped America.''"
"Four firefighters were killed on Thursday and one was seriously injured when an arson fire ripped through a hilly patch of Southern California, destroying thousands of acres and forcing hundreds of residents to evacuate their homes. By Thursday night, the fire was still uncontained and, buoyed by strong and gusting winds, rolling west along the thick desert terrain. Officials said the fire, which began about 1 a.m. Thursday just northwest of Palm Springs, was deliberately set but did not give details. Carried by 25 mile an hour winds, it spread throughout craggy, mostly unincorporated areas in Riverside County, where residents began to evacuate in the dark of night. The flames quickly encountered the Santa Ana winds, which are common this time of year, and streaked through the parched vegetation, igniting ranch homes, some of which burned to their foundations, and scorching at least 24,000 acres, including 10,000 acres in just four to five hours. By midday Thursday, a long and wide churning curtain of orange-beige smoke cloaked a wide strip of desert, and the smell of smoke lingered as far west as downtown Los Angeles, 90 miles away. Officials painted a horrific scene in Cabazon, where five firefighters were working to protect a home and found their truck suddenly engulfed in flames when the wind shifted. Three firefighters died at the scene, and one died hours later at the hospital. A fifth was in critical condition Thursday night. The names of the firefighters, members of the United States Forest Service, were not released. It was the worst loss of life among firefighters in Riverside County in over 50 years. Officials said they would offer $100,000 to any informant who led them to an arrest of the arsonist. ''A deliberately set arson fire that leads to the death of anyone constitutes murder,'' Chief John Hawkins of the Riverside County Fire Division of the California Department of Forestry said. Residents of Twin Pines, an area near the origin of the fire, awoke in the middle of the night to the strong odor of smoke and an orange glow over the top of the mountains. By 3 a.m. emergency workers were ordering them out, and they hustled to collect clothes, family photos, insurance papers and pets. ''Does anybody know anything about Wonderview?'' Lilly Arroyo, 77, called out through tears at an evacuation center at the Banning Community Center, near Cabazon. A dozen neighbors huddled around a television hoping for a glimpse of their homes from news coverage, but shook their heads, ''No.'' Her cockatiel, Toots, died, Ms. Arroyo said, as she sped from her trailer home in the path of a wall of flames. Officials said roughly 700 people had fled their homes. Chief Hawkins said that 11 structures had been destroyed but that he did not have details of what they were. The chief said at a news conference last night that the fire was 5 percent contained. ''That may not sound like a lot,'' he said, ''but it truly is.'' The rocky terrain and lack of open roads made it hard for emergency workers to get water to the fire-fighting sites; 400 people in recreational vehicles on a mountain near the fire's center were told to stay put, protected by firefighters, so as not to clog the only open road to the area. Fire officials said winds hampered efforts to drop water and fire retardant. ''Dry, windy weather can push a fire like this to grow very quickly,'' said Patrick Chandler, a spokesman for the Riverside County Fire Department. '' Dennis Watkins, 54, just finished building his ''dream home'' in May and, following the authorities' precautions against wildfires, had cleared away much of the brush and trees near the house. On Thursday he asked neighbors at the community center if they had heard anything and waited for definitive word. Some residents snaked their way up a one-lane road out of town; using a leash, one farmer pulled his lama alongside his truck. With 1,000 firefighters already at work and 2,000 more coming, officials worried that the fire could reach an area of the San Bernardino National Forest where a bark beetle infestation had killed trees that could easily fuel a blaze. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said the state ''will put the full force of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection behind fighting this fire and will reach out to evacuees to see what can be done in their time of need.'' The governor also declared a state of emergency in Riverside County. Wildfires in California's national forests are common this time of year. Almost exactly three years ago, fires killed 17 people and burned more than 376,000 acres and 2,600 homes across San Diego County."
"The police are investigating whether a man charged this week in two brush fires may be connected to last week's wildfire near Palm Springs that killed five United States Forest Service firefighters. The man, Raymond L. Oyler, 37, of Beaumont, was arrested on Tuesday on charges of setting two brush fires in June in Banning Pass, close to the Esperanza fire started last week that burned 40,200 acres and destroyed 54 buildings, including 34 houses. It was brought under control on Monday evening. The Riverside County Sheriff's Department, which along with several other law enforcement agencies made the arrest, said Mr. Oyler ''is not a suspect in the Esperanza fire but is a person of interest.'' Before he was jailed on Tuesday, he was questioned on Friday and his home was searched on Monday, according to the sheriff's department. The district attorney's office said Mr. Oyler, who is being held on $25,000 bail, would be arraigned on Thursday. Sgt. Earl Quinata, a spokesman for the sheriff's department, said no further information was available on the investigation or the fires Mr. Oyler was accused of setting. Two other people were questioned and released on Monday in connection with last week's fire, The Associated Press reported. Relatives of Mr. Oyler did not respond to telephone messages left for them Wednesday. Mr. Oyler's arrest took place a couple of hours before the death of the fifth firefighter, Pablo Cerda, 23, of Fountain Valley, who had suffered severe burns over nearly his entire body. Mr. Cerda's injuries, despite surgeries and other treatment, left him with little hope of survival, and his family agreed to disconnect him from life support. ''They decided to let Pablo go,'' said Dr. Dev A. Gnanadev, medical director of the Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton, where Mr. Cerda was treated. The four other firefighters, part of a crew overwhelmed by wind-whipped flames shooting up a hillside as they tried to save a house, died Thursday. Mr. Cerda was one of two seasonal crew members in their second year of firefighting with the Forest Service; the other members had several years of experience. His death made the fire the deadliest for forest or brush firefighters since 14 were killed near Glenwood Springs, Colo., in July 1994. All evacuation orders were lifted Monday and residents have begun returning to their homes or assessing damage. Several government agencies are investigating the fire, including the inspector general of the United States Agriculture Department, which oversees the Forest Service. That investigation, mandated by a 2002 law, is required when Forest Service firefighters die trapped in flames or overrun by them. The law was enacted after investigations into the deaths of four Forest Service firefighters in Washington in 2001 determined that the agency had ignored most of its own safety standards in directing firefighters at the blaze. Federal and state officials said it appeared that the firefighters in the Esperanza fire had been following procedures and were simply caught off guard. Private funerals are planned. A public memorial service is scheduled for Sunday afternoon in Devore."
"A Californian already accused in two brush fires was charged on Thursday with murder and other crimes in connection with a wildfire last week that killed five United States Forest Service firefighters. The man, Raymond L. Oyler, who lives in Beaumont, near the origin of the fatal fire, pleaded not guilty to multiple counts of murder, arson and related crimes a week after the wildfire started, on Oct. 26. The five-day fire, called the Esperanza fire, blackened 40,200 acres and destroyed 34 houses. Because of the deaths and their stemming from arson, Mr. Oyler, who is being held without bail, is eligible for the death penalty. The Riverside County district attorney-elect, Rod Pacheco, said he would decide within 60 days whether to pursue it. Mr. Oyler's lawyer, Mark R. McDonald, said in an interview after the court hearing that the haste of Mr. Oyler's arrest ''raises eyebrows.'' In two days, Mr. McDonald said, Mr. Oyler went from being arrested as a suspect in unrelated fires and a ''person of interest'' in the deadly blaze to being accused of setting it. In the wake of the firefighters' deaths, Mr. McDonald said, ''emotion tends to drive everything, and they needed to find somebody.'' Mr. Oyler is terrified, he said, adding: ''He really just looks like he is in a fog. He is in shock. He has no clue why they picked him.'' Mr. Oyler has worked in an automotive oil-change store and has a girlfriend and a baby daughter who appears to be younger than 6 months old, the lawyer said. The criminal complaint charges Mr. Oyler with setting unrelated brush fires in the summer and fall. The police said they had found evidence linking him to the Esperanza fire but declined to give details. He used an unspecified incendiary device, the complaint says. In an interview on KCAL-TV, Neil Lingle, the Riverside County undersheriff, said that ''tips and outstanding police work'' had led to the arrest but that it had not been determined whether anyone would claim the $500,000 reward offered for information resulting in it. The five firefighters were killed by a burst of fire, fed by fierce winds, that blasted up a hill and overwhelmed them and the house they were trying to save, the authorities said. Three died at the scene, and two died later in a hospital. Janis Oyler, an aunt of Mr. Oyler, said in a brief telephone interview that the news of the arrest ''shocked me as a relative of his.'' ''I never knew him to be like that, in fires or anything,'' Ms. Oyler said, adding that she had lost touch with his side of the family in recent years. Jean Wade Evans, supervisor of the San Bernardino National Forest, where the firefighters worked, said in a statement that the Forest Service continued to grieve but that ''this arrest helps with some of the closure, the healing, we need in the Forest Service community and in the families.''"
"Thinning forests without also burning accumulated brush and deadwood may increase forest fire damage rather than reduce it, researchers at the Forest Service reported in two recent studies. The findings cast doubt on how effective some of the thinning done under President Bush's Healthy Forests Initiative will be at preventing fires if the forests are not also burned. The studies show that in forests that have been thinned but not treated with prescribed burning, tree mortality is much greater than in forests that have had thinning and burning and those that have been left alone. Another study, on Blacks Mountain Experimental Forest in Northern California, had similar findings. The studies, combined with other recent research showing that climate change is reducing snowpack and making the fire season longer and more intense, have prompted researchers to urge the Forest Service to use prescribed fire more. ''We need fire on the ground,'' said Dr. Ronald H. Wakimoto, a professor of forestry at the University of Montana who studies fire. ''The only thing that stops fires is previous fire or prescribed fire.'' A study of a 500,000-acre wildfire in Oregon in 2002, called the Biscuit fire, showed that the mortality rate of trees in forests that had neither thinning nor prescribed burns was a little more than half. The study, published in late 2005 in The Canadian Journal of Forest Research, found that 80 to 100 percent of the trees in forests that had only been thinned died in the blaze, while 5 percent of the trees died in forests that had been thinned and burned. A 2003 study of another large blaze, the Hayman fire in Colorado in 2002, published as a case study by the Forest Service, showed that fires killed 50 percent of the trees in a natural, unthinned forest but killed 90 percent in a thinned forest, because the fire on the ground was hotter. When thick stands of small trees are cleared and space is created between larger trees, it causes a mat of litter several inches thick, including pine needles, slash from thinning and other debris, to dry out. New growth of shrubs and grasses, stimulated by thinning, also adds to the fuel load. When a fire gets started, it burns hotter and moves faster than when it was slowed by thicker growth. ''The forest floor is hotter, drier and windier,'' Dr. Wakimoto said. ''When we thin, we're not getting the shade, and the vegetation doesn't slow the winds.'' He said thinning near urban areas was particularly worrisome. ''If they don't treat the fuels on the ground, the fire will get to the homes faster,'' he said. Thinning may create room to fight fires, he said, but it creates a false sense of security because serious fires can still happen. Thinning is often done to prevent crown fires, which move through treetops, but unless crowns are 20 feet apart, which is usually not the case, surface fires can still create crown fires. The most efficient way to decrease these fire risks is with prescribed fire, which can be difficult in areas with houses. So-called activity fuels, the debris left by thinning, were a big part of the problem in the Biscuit fire. ''Thinning needs to be done completely,'' said Crystal L. Raymond, a researcher at the College of Forest Resources at the University of Washington, ''including activity fuels, which can be done with prescribed burning.'' Forests around the West have adapted to frequent fires, which were set by lightning and for centuries by American Indians. But regular, minor fires have been thwarted because of increasing numbers of homes in grasslands and forests. When a fire does start, it feeds on accumulated fuel and is more damaging than smaller, recurring fires would have been. Federal officials say they understand the role of prescribed burns but have not used them widely. ''It's an issue of sequence,'' said Mark E. Rey, under secretary for natural resources and the environment at the Agriculture Department. ''We'll follow the thinning with prescribed burns.'' Thinning has been controversial, even when accompanied by prescribed burns, since the Healthy Forests Restoration Act was signed into law in 2003. A 1996 federal study, the Sierra Nevada Ecosystem Project, was conducted by a team led by Dr. Don C. Erman, emeritus professor of ecology at the University of California, Davis. Dr. Erman said thinning could be effective only if it was repeated as often as every two years, which would be prohibitively expensive. ''It's a treadmill you have to be on all the time,'' he said. Prescribed fire may extend the period between thinnings, he said, but not by much. Prescribed fire can also be controversial, though for a different reason. A 2000 blaze in New Mexico called the Cerro Grande fire that started as a prescribed fire burned more than 40,000 acres and 400 houses near Los Alamos. A report by the Office of the Inspector General at the Agriculture Department issued in March was critical of the Forest Service's management of the Healthy Forests Initiative, saying the program had no consistent analytical process to determine which areas were most at risk and did not set priorities for projects. Mr. Rey said those things had been addressed. ''They looked at early treatments,'' he said. ''Many of the things the inspector general found are things we are aware of and that we've moved on to correct.''"
"A surge in wildfires in the mountains of the West since the 1980's, particularly the northern Rockies, appears to have been caused mainly by the warming climate, a new study says. Researchers from several universities, writing in the online journal Scienceexpress.org, sifted records on forest fires and climate conditions and found that human activities like timber cutting were less important than factors like a shortening snow season and rising summer temperatures, particularly in forests more than a mile high. The scientists said further warming from the buildup of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide was likely to lengthen the Western fire season. ANDREW C. REVKIN (NYT)"
"Rain provided some relief yesterday for firefighters battling a blaze that has consumed nearly 85,000 acres in Southern California. Nearly a quarter of an inch of rain fell yesterday, with more expected today. ''It was the best kind of rain we could have,'' said Miguel Miller, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service. ''It wasn't heavy enough to drive firefighters out. The atmosphere is actually getting more moist.'' About 40 firefighters working on a ridge did, however, seek temporary shelter from lightning early yesterday morning. The fire, which stretches from the San Bernardino National Forest, east of Los Angeles, to a populated area of Yucca Valley, in a desert area 26 miles north of Palm Springs, was ignited last week by lightning strikes. Mr. Miller said the wet weather had diminished the chances of lightning starting another fire. More than 3,300 firefighters from as far away as Missouri have descended on the area to stop the inferno, which began as four fires in two locations. Pushed by the wind, the fires traveled 20 miles and merged on Friday. ''We have people here from across the U.S. because we can't deplete our local firefighting resources -- we'd have nothing left if another fire broke out,'' said Bill Sapp, an archaeologist with the federal Forest Service. Firefighters and prison work crews have dug trenches and cut back brush to contain the blaze. Rugged forest terrain has made combating the fire difficult, Dr. Sapp said, and many firefighters have had to drop in by helicopter. ''We can't drive people in there,'' he said. ''We're fighting it with shovels and picks. That's how we fight fires in the forest.'' Airplanes have also been dropping water and fire retardant, Dr. Sapp said. Despite the efforts, the fire in the forest is only 26 percent contained, Dr. Sapp said, partly because of an infestation of bark beetles that has left an abundance of dead trees. ''It's excellent food for the fire,'' he said. ''It burns really well.'' In contrast, the Yucca Valley area is flatter, with tumbleweeds, cactus and chaparral for fuel. One civilian has died and 15 firefighters have been injured, officials said. So far, the cost of fighting the fire has reached $17 million, Dr. Sapp said."
"THIS summer, construction crews are once again in a race with fire crews all over the West. Last year, more than eight million acres burned. So far this season, more than 60,000 wildfires have consumed four million acres. Yet those counties in Colorado and New Mexico afflicted in recent years by the worst wildfires are also among those with the greatest influx of new residents. Half of the nation's population growth is taking place in the 10 fastest-growing states; seven of those states rank in the top 10 in the percentage of their population at risk from wildfire. This land rush into the tinderbox makes no distinction between safe and unsafe neighborhoods or building materials. But then, neither does the federal government, which endorses indiscriminate acceptance of fire risk by subsidizing it indiscriminately. Taxpayers build roads and power lines into the firetraps and insure the mortgages of those who live there. When the fire closes in, we pay to rescue the victims. Thus we encourage construction while risking the lives of both homeowners and those who rescue them. This week, nearly 4,000 firefighters are working to control a blaze in Southern California that so far has claimed 110 square miles, dozens of homes and one life. It's unclear how many billions are wasted in this cruel fashion, largely because it's impossible to calculate the precise amount of the federally insured mortgages that underwrite construction in flame zones. But since 2000, suppression and clean up of this annual conflagration has cost more than $1 billion a year -- most of it almost certainly spent on contracts with private companies. A fire-industrial complex has grown up to take advantage of this big business. In hot, dry places with vegetation that burns, wise communities require fire-resistant construction. But according to a recent Government Accountability Office report, such ''firewise principles'' are frequently ignored. The current system, the G.A.O. said, provides little incentive ''to mitigate fire risks, such as requiring homeowners to use fire-resistant materials and landscaping.'' This is madness. The reinsurance industry knows precisely -- ZIP code by ZIP code, mailbox by mailbox -- where, and how severely, people are at risk in fire-prone states. The industry does not purposefully deny this information to the public, but few know where to find it. Efforts to reduce taxpayer subsidies that urge people into danger should begin with access to the facts. Few families would put their lives and possessions in firetraps if fully informed of the risks. Most migrants to the fire-prone West are told only that it's been hot and dry -- lately. We need a National Flame Zone Atlas detailing the country's relative exposure to fire. Based on that information, subsidies for homebuilding and infrastructure in specific locales should be granted or withheld. The mere existence of a National Flame Zone Atlas would drive home two truths: that wildfire is a fact of life and that the moral and political imperative before us is not just adapting to wildfire, but reducing the number of people going uninformed into danger. Fire, like flood, teaches political lessons about costly taxpayer subsidies that encourage building in danger zones. We need to stop encouraging people to build houses where houses don't belong.

"As Israel continues the bombing campaign that has turned parts of Lebanon into rubble, environmentalists are warning of widespread and lasting damage. Spilled and burning oil, along with forest fires, toxic waste flows and growing garbage heaps have gone from nuisances to threats to people and wildlife, they say, marring a country traditionally known for its clean air and scenic greenery. Many of Lebanon's once pristine beaches and much of its coastline have been coated with a thick sludge that threatens marine life. As smoke billowed overhead on Friday, turning day into dusk, Ali Saeed, a resident, recounted how war has changed this small industrial town about 15 miles south of Beirut. Most people have left, he said. It is virtually impossible to drive on the roads, and almost everyone hides behind sealed windows. ''There's nowhere to run,'' Mr. Saeed said, showing off the black speckles on his skin that have turned everything white here into gray. ''It's dripping fuel from the sky.'' A large oil spill and fire caused by Israeli bombing have sent an oil slick traveling up the coast of Lebanon to Syria, threatening to become the worst environmental disaster in the country's history and engulfing this town in smoke. ''The escalating Israeli attacks on Lebanon did not only kill its civilians and destroy its infrastructure, but they are also annihilating its environment,'' warned Green Line, a Lebanese environmental group, in a statement issued Thursday. ''This is one of the worst environmental crises in Lebanese history.'' The most significant damage has come from airstrikes on an oil storage depot at the edge of Jiyeh on July 13 and 15. Oil spewed into the Mediterranean Sea and a fire erupted that has been burning ever since. Four of the plant's six oil storage containers have burned completely, spilling at least 10,000 tons of thick fuel oil into the sea initially, and possibly up to 15,000 more in the weeks since. A fifth tank burst into flames on Thursday, residents said, adding to a smoke cloud that has spewed soot and debris miles away. The fire is so hot that it has melted rail cars into blobs and turned the sand below into glass. Engineers are concerned that a sixth tank still untouched by the fire could soon explode, making the situation even graver. The prevailing winds and currents have swept the oil northward up the coast of Lebanon, and on Friday it reached the coast of Syria, Environment Ministry officials said. ''You can't swim in the water anymore, it's all black,'' Mr. Saeed said. ''This is like the Exxon Valdez spill in America,'' he said, speaking of the environmental damage caused when a tanker ran aground and spilled about 40,000 tons of oil into Prince William Sound in Alaska in 1989. Lebanon's coast is an important nesting ground for the green sea turtle, an endangered species, as well as a spawning ground for some Mediterranean fish. Turtle eggs begin hatching in July, but with the oil slick coating most of the area, baby turtles will have a far smaller chance of making it to deeper waters and surviving, environmentalists say. The oil slick is also threatening bluefin tuna that migrate to the eastern Mediterranean this time of year. The Environment Ministry sent crews to various parts of the country this week to assess the damage and begin the cleanup, a spokeswoman said. But the oil slick has quickly proven beyond the government's limited capacity to deal with the problem. The ministry estimates cleanup alone will cost upwards of $200 million, a major sum in a country with a gross domestic product of around $21 billion, but experts warn the bill could run even higher. Jordan has offered to send experts to provide technical assistance, and Kuwait has pledged to send material and equipment to help clean up the spill. Brush fires in many parts of the country have been an equally pressing concern as they rage unabated. Firefighters and forestry workers cannot move around for fear of being targets, and resources are being used to help refugees. ''In Israel there are planes taking care of forest fires, but in Lebanon these fires are not being extinguished or even noticed because our priorities have shifted from the environment to relief and humanitarian work,'' said Mounir Abou Ghanem, director general of the Association for Forest Development and Conservation in Beirut. Much of the budget for environmental protection and development has been sacrificed for relief work, he said. The oil spills, he said, will eventually be cleaned up and solid waste will be collected and disposed of when the war is over, but the forests are irreplaceable. ''In the end, who cares if a forest is on fire when there are people dying, others are being displaced and their houses or factories are on fire?'' he said. Water pollution has become an issue, too, said Karim el-Jisr, senior associate at Ecodit, a nongovernmental environmental association. Wastewater and freshwater canals are very close together and the many bombs that have hit roads and other infrastructure have damaged them. As a result, Mr. Jisr said, wastewater is contaminating the freshwater supply, especially in rural areas, causing further environmental degradation. But experts warn that the real environmental impact of the war will not be clear until the fighting ends. ''This war will affect the soil and the air,'' said Hala Ashour, the director of Green Line, the environmental group. ''But it's still too early to assess the actual damage because we have to analyze samples and that can't be done before the war is over.'' In Jiyeh, Mr. Saeed and the few other remaining residents have begun learning to live with the pollution. Within the first few days of the oil fire, Mr. Saeed said, they wore masks to breathe; now, he said, they are used to it. Maher Ali, 24, a fisherman, said: ''When the winds blow north, it's bearable, but when it blows east, it's deadly. The soot lands on the food and furniture and makes everything dirty. You just can't leave a glass of water sitting around. It's no wonder most families have given up and left.'' HOSTILITIES IN THE MIDEAST: ENVIRONMENT"
"''Mudfire'' probably looked like a good thing on paper. Performed by eight members of the Carpetbag Brigade Physical Theater Company, a San Francisco-based stilt-walking troupe, the 45-minute piece was inspired by forest fires that swept through Arizona and other areas of the West in 2002 and tried to evoke the interplay between fire, gods and mortals. It all sounded promisingly mythic. But the Brigade, which performed on Tuesday night at Lincoln Center Out of Doors, never got past those stilts. It was hard to figure out what, exactly, was going on in the general back-and-forthing by an apparent god, a snorting apparent monster, five fire-people and an irritating non-stilt-walking sprite, her skin painted red. Jay Ruby, who founded the company and directs it with Kristen Greco, was a lovably comical monster. But only Anson Smith, a pale-skinned god with a Mohawk haircut, took the stilt-walking to an awesomely higher level, his body articulated and seemingly buoyed by air as he towered above the audience, a skyscraper in motion. Ms. Greco's choreography featured rises from backbends that were impressive in their physical control, at least the first few times. There were tentative battles. There were also splits, and splits, and splits. And the soundtrack meandered in this increasingly dull piece. ''I like opera,'' one young woman said to another as the crowd filed out of Lincoln Center Plaza at the end. DANCE REVIEW"
"During the wildfire season, John Kennedy works 16 hours a day fighting fires, often for 14 days straight in temperatures that sometimes exceed 120 degrees. He carries 50 pounds of gear over often-rugged terrain while coordinating ground crews, helicopters and slurry bombers. When his day is done, Mr. Kennedy returns to a base camp and does paperwork. Though he is constantly fighting mental and physical fatigue, he finds it hard to sleep. ''You're anticipating the next day,'' he said. ''When you're on assignment, it's hard to disengage and rest.'' Mr. Kennedy, a captain in the Reno, Nev., fire department, started out as a member of a federal ''hot shot'' firefighting crew 29 years ago, and is now a supervisor with the federal interagency team that fights wildfires across the West each season. The men and women who do such work come back year after year, often at pay scales that start under $10 an hour. In the off-season, some hold other jobs. While wild-land firefighters in decades past were overwhelmingly young, single and male, the face of firefighting has changed. Nowadays, women make up about 10 percent of the ranks, and their numbers are growing. Firefighters and supervisors must provide their own tents. Everything else is provided by an army of contractors who deliver the goods to fire scenes. The contractors supply portable toilets, portable showers, buses to transport crews from base camps to the fire lines, and food service. Firefighters get a guaranteed daily diet of 4,000 calories, about twice the daily recommendation for the average American. The work schedule leaves crews with little time to think about anything but fighting fires. ''I'm always asking what day it is,'' said Shari Maerz, 35, in her first season of fighting wildfires. ''There's no reason to keep track of days.'' Ms. Maerz, who works on an engine company for a private contractor that provides firefighters to the federal government, had been a hospital emergency room worker. It is not a job that fits well with married life. In the fire season, which runs from early spring till Nov. 1, the home lives of most firefighters are a series of brief encounters. Their work lives mirror those of oil-field workers, but at considerably less pay. ''We have the same problem as law enforcement,'' said Bill Bryant, who has been fighting wildfires since 1970. ''You're gone for long times. There is a fairly high divorce rate.'' The constants in a firefighter's routine are the road, fires and the 4,000-calorie days. And it is wearing. Mr. Kennedy, 48, recognizes that he cannot do this work indefinitely. He does not know when the job will prove too much, but he does know that he will miss it when he goes. ''The hardest profession to leave is firefighting,'' he said. ''You miss the camaraderie, the challenge, the adrenaline rush.'' ''I'm going to have regrets,'' he added. ''It's going to be tough to see a big timber fire and not help.''"
"Thousands of residents were evacuated on Tuesday as a fast-growing wildfire, ignited Monday by a lightning strike, threatened high-altitude homes and populous subdivisions. More than 8,000 acres had burned by early evening on Tuesday as the fire swept across Casper Mountain, a heavily forested peak of more than 8,000 feet just south of Casper. It is dotted with an estimated 800 homes, 150 of them year-round residences. The fire then swept down the mountain toward subdivisions west of the city, which has about 50,000 residents, officials said. One mountain home had burned as of late Tuesday afternoon, and more than 300 were threatened on the mountain's top and north slope. As the blaze grew, officials announced that a federal interagency team was being rushed to the city to take over management of the fire. Federal officials could call in additional firefighters and equipment, both in short supply because 40 large wildfires and many smaller ones were burning across the country. ''We need more aircraft and more people,'' said Rick Young, a spokesman for the Natrona County Fire Protection District, which is helping to coordinate more than 200 city and suburban firefighters who are battling the blaze. On Tuesday, two helicopters and two slurry bombers were assisting the firefighters, and any fire trucks that could be spared were rushed to the fire. Earth graders, bulldozers and old military vehicles were also pressed into service, as were large tank trucks that hauled water from hydrants at the base of the mountain to fire trucks on top. Evacuees were initially sent to a gymnasium at Casper College and from there to local hotels. Many left with few possessions, grabbed in haphazard fashion. ''You don't think about what you might need,'' said Barb Wrubel, whose dome-shaped home is at 8,200 feet. ''We had only one hour to prepare.'' She and her husband jammed items like clothes, chips, tuna, their bagpipes and their cat into a car and a recreational vehicle. They left behind their home, three pickup trucks, three snowmobiles, two all-terrain vehicles and most of their household goods. The fire threatenedthe city's radio and television towers, which are on top of Casper Mountain. It also threatened two of the state's largest winter nesting grounds for bald and golden eagles. The fire has been made worse by drought and by many decades of fire suppression, which has resulted in an enormous buildup of flammable material. The area includes miles of ponderosa and lodgepole pines as well as patches of oily sagebrush, which is particularly flammable. ''The timber is drier than what you get out of a lumber store,'' said Stacey Scott, who runs the Eagle Ridge Ranch with his three brothers. Roughly 2,000 of the burned acres lie on Mr. Scott's land. Without fire suppression, he said, the forest would have burned periodically and would not have had the same potential for a conflagration. His son, Joe, drove to view the fire on Monday night and described the scene: ''There was a line of fire nearly a mile long of burning sage with flames 7 to 15 feet high. I was a mile away, and we could hear the roar. At first we thought it was a helicopter. Then we realized we were listening to the fire.'' The mountain homes were of particular concern. The mountain has had settlements since a late-19th-century mining boom. But in recent years, people have built homes despite warnings that the mountain was overdue for a major fire. The mountain had not had a big fire for more than a century, officials said."
"The Hezbollah rocket fire that has kept Israelis in the north of the country in underground bomb shelters for weeks is also taking a toll on the environment there, igniting hundreds of fires in Israel's few forests, in the Galilee region. Officials estimated Monday that as much as 9,000 acres of land, including almost 3,000 acres of forest, has been damaged by fire in the nearly four weeks of cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. The conflict has brought daily barrages of rockets from Lebanon. ''There has never been a situation like this before,'' said Shimon Romach, 57, Israel's national fire and rescue commissioner, during a break late last week from reviewing the situation with his staff at the fire station in the town of Nahariya, one of the stations being used as an operations center during the crisis. Aerial and topographical maps of the region line the walls of their operations room. ''Lately there are more Katyushas, and so more land is being burned,'' Mr. Romach said. Many of the rockets, packed with tons of explosive material, have landed and detonated in the forests, vineyards, orchards and open fields of Galilee, which in more peaceful times has been celebrated for its green vistas and tranquillity. The greening of Israel, a largely arid country, has been a major part of the Zionist ethos. Many of the forests that are now under fire were planted by the Jewish National Fund in the 1950's, during the early years of the Israeli state. At least one major forest in northern Israel has lost up to 75 percent of its trees. Across the border in southern Lebanon, forest fires also rage, from Israeli bombs. In the dry heat of summer, the land is especially vulnerable. Mr. Romach has brought firefighters from other parts of the country to expand local forces. In normal times there are three shifts of 75 firefighters a day in northern Israel. These days there are more than 180 on each shift. He coordinates his operations with those of the Jewish National Fund. The fund, which predates the state of Israel and is supported by the government and private donations, is the official caretaker of the land, including the nation's forests. It has its own force of about 100 firefighters. Mr. Romach said that during the current crisis the firefighters had been working long days without sufficient staff or equipment. They are sent to as many as 100 fires a day, including those in residential and public buildings as well as forests and other open areas. Although many of them are not equipped with flak jackets, they sometimes they find themselves putting out fires even as Katyusha rockets fall nearby. Small planes, usually used in the north for crop-dusting, are being employed to help put out the fires. Pilots release tons of a red flame retardant to contain the fires. The flames in the most serious fires have reached as high as 130 feet. But Mr. Romach said he had run out of money from his regular budget to hire the planes. The Jewish National Fund has provided extra emergency money to cover operations for now, but it was not immediately clear when additional government financing would come through. The fund has been raising money abroad to buy additional safety equipment and trucks. Amir Levi, 33, the chief of operations for the Western Galilee fire department, surveyed the damage one recent day in a single-engine plane. He pointed out a swath of blackened earth on the border with Lebanon, the aftermath of a blaze that ignited when a Hezbollah rocket plunged into a forest of pine trees. ''As firefighters we, too, are taking part in this war,'' said Mr. Levi, who has not had a day off since the fighting -- and the fires -- began with a cross-border attack by Hezbollah on July 12. He sent his wife and two young daughters to a kibbutz in the southern part of the country for their protection. ''We are among those fighting on the home front,'' he said. The firefighting teams include Jews and Arabs. ''There is a type of coexistence under fire,'' said Dr. Omri Bonneh, the Jewish National Fund's director for Israel's northern region. ''They work together, shoulder to shoulder. The volunteers from nearby that come out to help are also both Arabs and Jews. They bring us food and water and encourage the firefighters.'' Mr. Romach expressed a more skeptical view. He said that there was evidence that some of the fires had been caused by arson and that there were suspicions that some local Arab residents might have set them to protest Israel's military action in Lebanon. No arrests have been made. There is great damage to the north's landscape, but it is unclear just how severe the long-term environmental damage will be. ''The ecological system is used to living with fires,'' said Raanan Boral, the head of the environmental protection division of the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel. ''It is part of life for the system. Some trees get burned, and so do some nests. Some animals don't have the time to flee, but the system can rehabilitate itself. It takes time and it is not nice to look at, but it is not an irreversible disaster.'' In Lebanon the environment has been hit harder. Most notably, Israeli airstrikes caused an oil spill that is devastating the country's coastline. Meanwhile, a group of volunteer firefighters from New York arrived last week to help reinforce their counterparts in Israel. ''We felt it was important we offer help in the north or help man depleted firefighting crews,'' said Nathan Rothschild, 49, from Rockland County, N.Y., who is helping to staff a Jerusalem firehouse, many of whose members have been called north. ''We feel if we can make a difference, we are happy to do that.'' HOSTILITIES IN THE MIDEAST: THE ENVIRONMENT"
"Bad wildfire years in the West have usually come with a giant, signature fire that resonates down the years through the lives lost or landscapes left scarred: Mann Gulch, 1949. Yellowstone, 1988. The Big Blowup, 1910. This year has been bad, firefighters and foresters say, partly for the very lack of that center. The fires of 2006 have been just about everywhere, from the plains of Texas and Nebraska to the high northern Rockies of Montana to the Nevada desert. The damage has been incremental and dispersed, but cumulatively no less devastating, with at least 7.1 million acres burned by late this week, more than in any comparable period in 10 years, federal figures indicate. ''It's kind of like we've got something here we can't get loose from,'' said Bobby Young, the state fire chief for the Texas Forest Service. Since late December 2005, about 1.4 million acres have burned in Texas alone, a mark not seen since at least the 1920's, Mr. Young said. The explanation for the year's fires is complex and diffuse. The intense heat waves that have blasted much of the country have played a central role. A 3,000-acre fire near Valentine, Neb., last month, for instance, broke out when the thermometer hovered at 113 degrees. The heat in July shattered 2,300 records across the country, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, from the most-ever days above 90 degrees in Helena, Mont., in July -- 23 out of 31 -- to the 117-degree record high in Cottonwood, S.D., on July 15. ''The signal is pretty hard to argue with,'' said Tom Wordell, a wildland fire analyst at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. Where there was heat, Mr. Wordell said, the grasses and trees dried up and became fuel. But the timing of that heat was just as important. Some areas of the northern Rocky Mountains that looked wet and relatively safe in the spring, with heavy snowpack, were struck by a heat wave in May and June that was intense enough to turn some of that snow directly into water vapor, a process called sublimation. With less liquid water runoff, scientists and firefighters said, the land dried quickly and was primed for the second punch of the season in July, as even hotter weather combined with a series of lightning-laced storms that sparked more fires. ''In 2004 and 2005 the fuels were there, ready to go, but the lightning patterns weren't correlating with the very hot periods,'' said Heath Hockenberry, the fire weather program manager for the National Weather Service. ''This year we had extended periods of hot weather exceeding 100 degrees and lightning peppered on top of that.'' The shifting meteorological consequences of the water temperature in the Pacific Ocean, which oscillates over time from slightly warmer than normal to slightly cooler to neutral, was another wild card. The year began with a mild La Niña pattern -- slightly cooler Pacific water than normal -- which is usually associated with dry conditions in the Southwest and the southern Plains. The pattern began to moderate around February, drifting toward neutral temperatures and raising hopes among meteorologists and firefighters that moister conditions might flow into some of the worst fire zones. It did not happen ''Those nice months of May and June just weren't as nice and green as they normally are,'' said Donald E. Westover, the fire program leader for the Nebraska Forest Service, where about 100,000 acres have burned this year, a record. Fewer houses have been lost to fire than in some of the worst years, like 2004, when 2,500 houses burned in one fire in Southern California, state and federal fire officials said. But again the losses have been incremental and mounting. The relatively small fire near Valentine, Neb., for example, destroyed 10 homes and damaged 10 others, Mr. Westover said. Some scientists said they saw indications that the Pacific could be shifting toward an El Niño condition -- water temperatures warmer than normal -- that has generally been associated with wetter conditions in the Southwest. But the trade-off in the past has been that El Niños have often meant even drier weather for states in the northern Rockies and the Pacific Northwest, where tens of thousands of acres are burning in already parched forests. Klaus Wolter, a climatologist at the University of Colorado in Boulder, said that until this year the central Plains had largely been spared by the record heat common since about 2000 elsewhere in the West. This year, Mr. Wolter said, there was a new weather wrinkle as the Midwest warmed up and dried out, and the volume of land lost to fire increased. ''This was the big ugly,'' he said."
"Firefighters have contained 30 percent of a wildfire that has destroyed four mountain cabins and threatened 600 seasonal and year-round homes. More than 400 federal and local firefighters are clearing a firebreak around the blaze, but Kathy-Jo Pollock, spokeswoman for the federal interagency firefighting effort, said it might take significant rain to extinguish it. The four-day-old blaze has seared more than 11,000 acres on the top and base of Casper Mountain. The fire briefly forced the closing of a major east-west state highway when flames raced down a canyon and jumped the roadway. DOUG McINNIS (NYT)"
"Scores of families remained in shelters or living with friends and relatives on Monday as firefighters worked to contain a large wildfire in south-central Montana, just north of Yellowstone National Park and the Wyoming state line. Officials ordered the evacuation of 265 people over the weekend in the fear that high winds would expand a stubborn 180,000-acre blaze burning in rugged mountain terrain. The fire, in timber and range land south of the tiny ranching town of Big Timber, is considered the country's top firefighting priority because of the difficulty of containing it and the risk to people and property. As of Monday the fire was just 20 percent contained. Twenty-six homes and 20 other buildings have been lost, most when a firestorm was created by high winds on Wednesday. No deaths or serious injuries have been attributed to the fire. Firefighters have been moving into the mountains to try to keep the blaze from spreading during the forecast high winds. ''The fuels are so dry, and with high winds expected it's going to be very difficult to try not to let it expand,'' said Dave Daniels, a fire information officer for the blaze, called the Derby fire. ''This weather is simply extraordinary.'' The moisture level in dead trees and other fuels is among the lowest in recorded history -- about twice as dry as kiln-dried lumber -- close to the conditions seen during the fires in Yellowstone in 1988. The homes that have been evacuated are a mix of family cabins and high-end second homes that have recently been built. Several celebrities, including the former ''NBC Nightly News'' anchor Tom Brokaw and the actor Michael Keaton, have homes in the area. Some evacuees are staying in a Red Cross shelter. Three large fires are also burning in the Gallatin Mountains west of Emigrant, Mont., leaving almost 18,000 acres charred. The fires have filled the sky across much of southern Montana with smoke, and ash is falling in some places. It has been a record year for fires in the West. The 10-year average for the number of fires is around 58,000 a year, and the average acreage burned is 4.7 million. So far this year there have been nearly 84,000 fires and more than eight million acres burned. ''We've had considerably more fires because of unusually high temperatures and a lot of lightning,'' said Randy Eardley, a spokesman for the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. ''It's been nonstop since January and February when fires broke out in Texas and Oklahoma.'' The high number of fires means that firefighting resources, including firefighters, helicopters and other equipment have been scarce. Nearly 800 firefighters are working on the Derby fire. The wildfire season in Montana is usually over by September but in extremely dry years can extend into November."
"THIS state, in recent years, has gained a new season, and it's not one we like very much. High summer and early autumn as Montanans used to know them -- bright, clean-edged and wild-yonder-blue -- have given way to the sooty skies, red moons and general unease of fire season. Runaway fire makes anyone edgy, even when you're not in its path or even very near by. And if you're in a neck-and-neck race for the United States Senate, you're not the soul of serenity to begin with. Witness the Republican incumbent, Conrad Burns, toward the beginning of fire season in late July, when he gave an impromptu tongue-lashing to a team of firefighters at the Billings airport who were on their way back home to Virginia after a week on a 92,000-acre fire in southern Montana. Senator Burns told them they had done a rotten job and later said that the crew ''didn't do a goddamned thing'' and that they just ''sit around.'' Not the most politic remarks he could have made as he began to defend himself in earnest against a stiff challenge for his seat from a Democrat, Jon Tester, whose mantra is that Mr. Burns has lost touch with ''Montana values,'' like defending the ordinary guy who's doing a hard, hot job. Senator Burns apologized for his maladroit remarks and said he should have gone to higher-ups with any beefs he or some of his rancher constituency had with the way the fire had been managed. And he later sponsored an amendment to a military spending bill that bolstered federal firefighting dollars. But the race heated up, and the incendiary remarks continued to fly. Mr. Burns lost the Montana cab-driver vote when he remarked that the country is up against a ''faceless'' enemy, terrorists who ''drive taxicabs in the daytime and kill at night.'' Nor has Mr. Tester kept foot out of mouth; in telling a reporter about the faith he has in his staff, he said, ''Nobody has done anything to make me think they're trying to tomahawk me,'' a verb that delighted the state Republican Party spokesman, who said it denigrated American Indians, the state's largest minority group. By the time the candidates convened for their second debate two weeks ago, even the audience seemed atypically fired-up for a Montana crowd that wasn't watching a sporting event in the strict sense of the term. The debate was held in Hamilton, in the Bitterroot Valley near the Idaho border, where forest fires had periodically been sending smoke hither and yon. As the candidates jousted, the crowd booed Mr. Burns and someone shouted ''psycho'' at him, and then a Burns supporter chastised the booers for rudeness. Mr. Burns, who received more money from the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff than any other member of Congress, accused Mr. Tester of being an unaccountable ''lawbreaker'' in his fund-raising practices. (He mentioned a $7,000 ''slush fund'' that Mr. Tester used for gas and meals on the campaign trail, and which the state's political practices' commissioner has said is legal.) The senator also accused Mr. Tester of failing to ''report'' a trade-mission trip he took to Taiwan as president of the State Senate. In turn, Mr. Tester reeled off a longish list of Senator Burns's trips, including 10 to Las Vegas, as well as the names of the multinational corporations from which the senator has taken money. And so on, and so forth. A good time was sort of had by some. After the debate Mr. Tester drove up to Missoula for a block party I also attended. The suggested donation was $35, which didn't do a lot to erase Mr. Tester's financial disadvantage. (Senator Burns had raised $7 million to the Tester campaign's $1.5 million as of June 30.) It's a margin that's going to play out on the airwaves. ''You're going to hear a lot of things that aren't true,'' he said with a weary grin. ''Of course, all our ads will be the truth.'' The crowd cheered. Smoke had cleared from the skies the day before, and September looked the way it was supposed to look if it wasn't fire season. But it still was. And everyone in both camps knew it was going to get a lot hotter, and a lot smokier, before it was over. Battlegrounds Deirdre McNamer is the author of the forthcoming novel ''Red Rover.''"
"The Boulder Valley, which bumps up against the wilderness north of Yellowstone National Park, is a quiet corner with an unusual mix of residents. They include celebrities, the merely wealthy, ranchers and others drawn to a place of quiet beauty. But nature has gone from serene to tempestuous of late. A fire that was detected on Aug. 22, started by lightning at Derby Mountain, has burned more than 185,000 acres. In the last two days, the blaze has turned this valley where ''The Horse Whisperer'' was filmed, into a raging caldron with flames sweeping through huge stands of trees and thick banks of smoke turning daytime into twilight and the sun into a glowing red ball. Montana is in an extended drought, fire officials say, and it is as dry as when fires swept through Yellowstone in 1988. The state is also battling a shortage of fire crews and equipment because so many fires are burning across the West. ''We're going as quick as we can, but people are fatigued,'' said Wally Bennett, the firefighting director. Though officials said the Derby fire was 45 percent contained, it jumped the first of two bulldozer lines on Wednesday in some places along the Boulder River. The lines had been hastily scraped around ranch houses and outbuildings, and the second line held, officials said. Firefighters spent Tuesday night dousing houses to protect them and setting backfires. A lack of wind has prevented a firestorm like one that erupted last week, but the forecast included a red-flag warning for high winds. Winds up to 60 miles an hour spread the fire rapidly east of here last week, near Absarokee, where it destroyed 26 houses. ''I'll never forget the sound when the fire came,'' said Janis Maclean, a waitress at the Grand Hotel in Big Timber who has a house near Bridger Creek. ''It sounded like the roar of jet engines.'' Ms. Maclean's house was spared, but it sits in a tiny island of green surrounded by burned forest as far as the eye can see. ''We did a little dance when the fire missed us,'' she said. ''But things have really changed.'' The fire is devastating to a region whose chief economic asset is its scenic beauty. Things have been tough at the McLeod Resort, which offers cabins and parking for campers near the post office and the lone store in town. ''We were full a couple of days ago,'' a resort owner, Courtney Rue, said from the back of his pickup cradling a beer and watching helicopters drop water on the flames. ''But everybody cleared out Sunday when the fire blew up.'' Keith and Marie Engle, who own the cattle ranch where ''The Horse Whisperer'' was filmed, said they were staying put despite an official evacuation order. ''There's no way we could leave and leave our livestock and buildings behind,'' Ms. Engle said. ''We have a big irrigating gun, and we're watering down our buildings, and I think we're in pretty good shape.'' Ranchers whose grazing land burned had heavy losses. ''Short term, it will be tough,'' said Sonny Todd, a real estate agent and rancher who lost 1,800 acres of range to the fire. ''We've lost all our grass for one year.'' Ranchers without grass may have to sell cattle, Mr. Todd said, though rangeland typically recovers after a year. His real estate business will take a hit, he said, adding: ''I had half a dozen ranch listings burned out. So they're on hold. The immediate effect will be that they probably cut the land value in half.'' Land has recently sold for $5,000 to $25,000 an acre. Martin Flanagan, who ranches with his father near Big Timber, said the fire forced his family to move cattle to a swamp. Mr. Flanagan said he worried about how the destruction of so much grass would affect elk and deer herds. ''It's going to be a tough winter for some of those critters,'' he said. Mr. Todd sounded optimistic. ''Maybe I sound too much like a Realtor,'' he said. ''But you'd be surprised how things come back. In five years, it's a nonimpact.'' The first order of business, though, is to put out the fire."
"Investigators inspected the wreckage of five oceanfront homes in Malibu on Tuesday trying to determine the cause of a fast-moving fire the night before that destroyed them and damaged several others. The actress Suzanne Somers, best known for her role as Chrissy in the 1970's sitcom ''Three's Company'' and as a promoter of health and exercise products on cable television, was among the people who lost their homes in the fire. ''I really think that we'll learn something great from this,'' Ms. Somers told reporters on a visit to the remains of her house on Tuesday morning. ''What else can you do with a tragedy, but look for the opportunity to grow spiritually and emotionally? And I know that we'll learn something great. It was a beautiful house. It was a beautiful place to live.'' She said she planned to rebuild. Ms. Somers and her husband and manager, Alan Hamel, were not home at the time of the fire, which began about 5 p.m. Monday in nearby Malibu Bluffs State Park, off Malibu Road. About 300 firefighters using 40 trucks and a few water-dropping helicopters brought it under control by 8 p.m. No one was seriously injured. The fire had spread quickly. It began as a relatively minor brush fire, but, whipped by winds gusting to more than 30 miles per hour, it consumed the houses and 20 acres within a half-hour. ''There was very little warning,'' said Ron Harelson, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. ''It was a miracle no other homes were lost or civilians were killed.'' Inspector Sam Padilla of the Fire Department said the cause had not been determined. Neighborhood residents, whose homes sit in close proximity to one another, dashed to save their property on Monday. The actress Victoria Principal was seen watering down her property with a garden hose. The identities of the owners of the destroyed houses and the six that were damaged were not released. Chief P. Michael Freeman of the Fire Department initially estimated damage at $60 million, but officials later said the figure was being reassessed. Malibu, where the rich and famous live along choice beaches and rugged hills, has periodic disastrous fires, floods and mudslides. A fire in November 1993 near the same area as Monday's killed three people and destroyed a few hundred homes."
"An unusually fast and furious brush fire destroyed four large seaside homes in Malibu Monday night and damaged at least two others, fire officials said. The fire began near a bluff-side park around 5 p.m. and raced down a hill toward the houses and the beach, burning 20 acres. Though tiny in comparison with Southern California wildfires that have burned areas the size of counties, the fire drew attention for its speed, consuming a number of homes within a half hour, and its burning in a community known as much for the rich and famous as disastrous fires, floods and mudslides. ''This was just on us immediately,'' Jeff Jennings, the mayor pro tem, told KNX-AM radio. Local television stations broadcast images of towering flames chewing through roofs and collapsing walls and fire trucks spraying blackened remnants that hinted at the elaborate architecture. In one image, a tower befitting a castle spewed flame from all sides and in another the frame of a large dome suddenly sunk into an inferno below. Billowing smoke wafted over lapping ocean waves. There were no reports of injuries. About 300 firefighters attacked the blaze, which was fed by wind gusts of 30 miles per hour and greater on an unusually warm evening. Firefighters quickly extinguished the burning brush but fought the flames in the houses well into the evening. The police shut down the Pacific Coast Highway, near the fire, blocking traffic for miles. There were no reports of deaths or injuries. It was not known who owned or lived in the homes, on or near Malibu Canyon Road, but news reports quoted real estate agents as saying they were worth several million dollars and that they offered commanding views of the ocean. Inspector Sam Padilla of the Los Angeles County Fire Department said it was fortunate the fire had begun close to the water, making it easier for firefighters to get to it and sparing homes in the rugged hills. ''If it keeps going it will burn into the sand,'' he said. A fire in November 1993 in Malibu near the same area killed three people and destroyed a few hundred homes."
"The steeply rising cost of preventing and suppressing wildfires, which burned more of the American landscape in 2006 than in any other year since at least 1960, is creating a rift between Washington and state and local governments over how the burden ought to be shouldered. A study issued in November by the inspector general's office of the United States Department of Agriculture, the parent agency of the Forest Service, said the nature of the wildfire threat was changing as private homes and communities pushed ever closer to the boundaries of once-remote public lands. Those communities and landowners, rather than federal taxpayers, should have to pay for more of their own fire protection, the report concluded. States and local governments are gearing up to fight back in Congress, arguing that decades of federal mismanagement of national forests and open spaces, not development, created the threat and that little communities with few resources are neither responsible for it nor equipped to make a difference. The pattern of wildfire distribution during the recently ended fire season, which charred more than 9.8 million acres, supports either side. According to federal statistics, more state, county and private lands burned than in any other year since 1997 -- about half the total 2006 losses -- primarily because of monstrous blazes in Oklahoma, in Texas and across the Upper Plains, regions where most property is privately owned. That finding, though also driven by broader factors like drought and heat that have little to do with residential development in fire-prone areas, supports the federal contention that the government has had to shift an increasingly large share of its resources from the task of protecting its own forests to firefighting elsewhere. In some places, though, the issue is more complex. In Stillwater County, Mont., north of Yellowstone National Park, for example, the small, long-established towns of Nye and Fishtail are bordered on two sides by national forest. In early July, the first of two huge fires erupted in the forest and roared into those communities, where 100,000 acres of mostly private land and 32 homes were burned. The blaze was the worst in the county's history, local officials say. ''The forest is very dry and primed for fires started by lightning, and when that occurs in a forest not managed as well as it could have been, it soon gets out of control and meets the community,'' said Ken Mesch, the Stillwater County disaster and emergency services coordinator. ''If the federal government started pulling back money for fire suppression, they would be hanging us out to dry.'' Federal land managers say protection of private land at the boundaries of public space -- called the wildland-urban interface -- is the fastest-growing component of the nation's firefighting budget. In 2003 and 2004, the inspector general's report estimated, the Forest Service spent at least half a billion dollars, and perhaps as much as a billion, protecting private property in such areas. The trend is similar at the Interior Department, which oversees hundreds of millions of acres of public lands in the West through the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Park Service. Fire prevention activities -- controlled fires or thinning of burnable vegetation -- have shifted there toward the interface lands, said Lynn Scarlett, deputy interior secretary. Ms. Scarlett said that almost half the 1.1 million acres treated by the Interior Department for fire-risk reduction in 2006 were in interface zones, about double the proportion as recently as 2002. She said her department, too, was considering that it demand increased cost-sharing by state and local governments, though she emphasized that any outcome would have to be collaborative. ''One of the last things you want in an emergency is people squabbling over who's going to pay,'' she said. The report from the Agriculture Department's inspector general said a major problem was simply the weight of accumulated assumptions: fire response in the West has long meant federal authorities' riding to the rescue, with no questions asked and no cost too great to bear. ''Public expectations and uncertainties about protection responsibilities,'' the report said, ''compel the Forest Service to suppress fires aggressively and at great expense when private property is at risk, even when fires pose little threat to National Forest system land.'' About 8.5 million homes were built at the wildland-urban interface within the interior West in the 1990s alone, according to the Forest Service. But state and local officials say they already pay their share to protect those communities and homeowners, partly because the residential growth has coincided with years of federal budget cuts. Arizona, for instance, now has 12 to 14 air tanker firefighting aircraft under contract, up from 2 to 4 in 2005, as a result of reduced federal spending on tankers, said Lori Faeth, a policy adviser to Gov. Janet Napolitano. ''Our forests are in the condition they are because of poor federal management,'' Ms. Faeth said. ''They've put us in this position, and they have the responsibility to pay for it.'' The Forest Service's director of fire and aviation management, Tom Harbour, said the agency would follow up on the inspector general's recommendations. ''We're not going to walk away,'' Mr. Harbour said, ''but we will engage in a vigorous debate with our partners about the right way to split the pie.'' Still, money is only part of the issue, he said. Communities and developers in the West should be thinking in new ways as well, he said, including the use of fire-wise construction techniques and preparedness plans that involve residents in their own defense even before fires start. Many land experts say hardly anyone is addressing the most tangled and emotional question raised by the debate: how much or how little voice federal land managers should have in land-use decisions. ''Thinking through in advance the fire implications of a new subdivision next to a national forest boundary -- that doesn't happen,'' said James L. Caswell, administrator of the Idaho Office of Species Conservation. Given the property rights issue and the tension between local governments and Washington that has shaped the West's culture for the last century, a system of planning that allows federal officials veto power would seem unlikely. Mr. Caswell said better planning must be part of the solution. ''A thousand houses next to a boundary could overwhelm all the other cost-control issues,'' he said. ''But,'' he added, ''that's a very emotional topic, so it's really hard to deal with.''"
"Australia's second-most-populous state, Victoria, is in the grip of one of the worst bush fire seasons in recorded history, and the state's government has issued warnings that with more hot weather on the way the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better. ''This is the worst bush fire conditions we have ever had in Victoria's history because it is going to go on, and it is going to get worse,'' the state's premier, Steve Bracks, said Wednesday, after cutting short his holiday to take control of the crisis. Almost 2.5 million acres of forest and farmland in the southeastern state have already been burned, and 200,000 people were without power on Tuesday after lines were bought down by the fires. Power was restored to most of them on Wednesday afternoon. Mr. Bracks warned that despite the 104-degree heat, people should continue to conserve electricity. ''We are bracing ourselves for some very, very tough conditions,'' he said. There have been no confirmed fatalities from the most recent fires, but eight houses have been destroyed. Seventy-five people died in Victoria and South Australia during the 1983 Ash Wednesday blazes. Mr. Bracks said the current conditions were ''the worst we have faced, but it's the best prepared we have been.'' Despite the efforts of about 3,000 firefighters, some using helicopters to water bomb the advancing lines of flames, the fires were spreading north on Wednesday, crossing the state border into New South Wales. Tourists and residents were being evacuated Wednesday from areas of the Snowy Mountains, including the resort town of Thredbo. Fire crews were using bulldozers to cut containment lines through the scrub and forest in an attempt to stop the advance of the fires, while aircraft were flying over the national park close to Thredbo to check for hikers and campers who might not have heard of the evacuation warning. Fire crews have been arriving from as far away as Canada, and a team from the United States was on its way. Firefighters are particularly concerned about the fire that caused the power failure, which is centered on Tatong in eastern Victoria. ''We are steering and managing the fire; we can't put it out,'' said Pauline Clancy, speaking for the Emergency Coordination Center at Victoria's Department of Sustainability and Environment. Some of the fires have been burning for more than a month, fueled by high temperatures following some of the driest conditions on record. Australia is in the grip of a drought that has desiccated huge areas of farmland and forest across the nation, creating perfect conditions for the major bush fires. Most of the fires are a result of lightning strikes on the dry scrub, but officials say that some may have been started by arsonists, including one that has combined with others to create the single largest fire, which covers almost two-thirds of the burned area and has been burning since Dec. 1. That fire already has a front almost 930 miles long. Critics say that the government has done too little to clear low scrub, which provides much of the fuel for the fires. Normally, the authorities set controlled fires in the winter so there is less fuel during the summer. The state government said that for large areas of Victoria, the winter was too dry to risk controlled burns. Fire crews say that even at night, when conditions usually ease, fires are racing from tree canopy to tree canopy, creating a situation that is almost impossible to control."
"Except for Bubba, there is not much life where the Fullards took up residence on this city's outskirts -- their mobile home razed by wildfires gnawing into 45,000 acres of South Georgia. And yet, despite the smoke-laden air and charred remains of cracked china and upside-down appliances, Bubba, the family's 6-year-old black labrador, keeps finding his way back here, resting in a ditch a few yards from where the front porch used to give him shelter. ''I don't think there's anything that can be saved,'' said Christy Fullard, 33, surveying her singed property. When Ms. Fullard fled the fire on Tuesday, she grabbed pictures off the shelves on her way out. Still, many treasures are gone -- her grandmother's matching vase and lamp and the deer heads claimed by her husband, Robin, 36. Around here, she said, ''you don't get a 10-point very often.'' Then there are the lost snapshots of their daughters' first accomplishments -- when Kalah crawled, Sarah rode a bike and Chelsea lost a tooth, said Ms. Fullard, who is pregnant and has shuttled between the homes of friends and relatives for shelter. ''It's these little things, but then you have to stay positive, because God's not going to put any more on you than you can handle,'' she said. Abiding faith and overwhelming community support have been the cornerstones of this area during the fires, which had encompassed 45,000 acres by Saturday. ''We're going to be here for quite some time,'' said Eric Mosley, public information officer of the Georgia Forestry Commission, who said he could not estimate how long it would take to quell the fire. More than 1,000 people have been evacuated over the course of the weeklong fires, which began with a tree falling across a power line, Mr. Mosley said. It has cost the state $1.7 million. Gov. Sonny Purdue, who was touring the area on Saturday, has asked for and received FEMA assistance, which will provide 70 percent of the money for firefighting and rebuilding the area. The state will carry the rest of the cost. But for its part, the local community has stressed its self-reliance. ''It's just amazing to see the community come together,'' said Carol Clarke, 48, who checked in firefighters and their equipment overnight on Friday at Ware County High School, where the parking lot has been converted into a meeting and resting spot for firefighters. ''I mean, everyone's talking about it.'' Organizations like the Chamber of Commerce have pitched in, sending e-mail messages about various needs that have been forwarded around town, Ms. Clarke said. Individuals have also pitched in. Sandra Kubik, owner of the Kickin K riding stable, has helped evacuate horses to her ranch for safekeeping and asked the local TV station to notify the public of her offer. At a community meeting on Friday night, Representative Jack Kingston acknowledged the volunteers. ''Instead of having turned to Washington for answers and solutions, y'all have turned to the person next to you,'' Mr. Kingston said. A range of public officers on hand gave details about the fires and evacuations at the meeting, but much of the talk came back to faith, fellowship and gratitude to the firefighters. More than one fire chief got choked up speaking about the courage of his colleagues. ''They were so filthy'' with ash they looked as if they rolled in dirt, said Fire Chief Jimmy Brown of Ware County. ''They was out there for a cause, for you and for your homes and for your timber,'' he said. ''Yes, we've lost a lot of timber, and I don't know what to say, but I know one thing. I know one thing for sure. We got a God in heaven. He's going to take care of us.''"
"Hundreds of firefighters from across the Southeast placed themselves between houses and wildfires in southern Georgia on Friday, trying to fend off blazes that have blackened 42,000 acres, destroyed 20 houses and forced hundreds of residents to evacuate. For the 10th day, gusting winds whipped flames through drought-stricken pine forests and fields, threatening houses in many of the rural communities that dot the Georgia-Florida border region. Forestry officials said they did not expect much relief in the days ahead from the dry conditions feeding the fires. Robert Armstrong, 36, a firefighter from Brunswick, said the huge blaze, named the Sweat Farm Road Fire, was among the worst that he had seen in 20 years. ''In the areas that are burnt,'' Firefighter Armstrong said, ''there's nothing.'' Gov. Sonny Perdue asked the federal government for assistance and announced that he would tour the area on Saturday. About 400 firefighters from at least four states tried to contain the blaze, which covers 58 square miles. Five aircraft, two helicopters and one United States Forest Service air tanker dumped retardant on the flames. Officials said they believed that the fire started on Monday when a tree toppled power lines. ''The wind is not helping,'' said Eric Mosely, public information officer for the Georgia Forestry Commission. ''Right now, we're looking at 35 percent containment, and we're trying to hold it there.'' Mr. Mosely said. About 1,000 residents of Ware County were removed earlier in the week, said Gordon Lowe, a site coordinator for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency who was working at a shelter at Ware County High School in Waycross, a city of 15,300 people on the northeastern edge of the burned area. ''If you were here yesterday, there were just ashes falling all over us,'' Mr. Lowe said. Rows of tents were set up in the school parking lot for firefighters who were exhausted after days of 13-hour shifts. Volunteers collected food for workers on the front lines. Joyce Rittenhouse, 58, of Waycross, who with her granddaughters staffed a food tent, said she made sure each that firefighter ate three bananas each day. ''You need potassium to fight fires,'' Ms. Rittenhouse said. Many Waycross residents returned to their houses after winds shifted on Friday and pushed the fire away from town. Forestry officials scrambled to get ahead of the blaze as it raced toward the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, a wetland sanctuary. Firefighters warned residents in tiny communities like Fargo, Manor and others to be prepared to flee. ''The smoke is rolling in,'' said John Corbitt, 65, a retiree in Manor who added that he could see flames over the tops of trees 8 to 10 miles from his house. ''We're sitting on red alert, ready.'' Mr. Corbitt, who had watched the winds and smoke shift around him for the last week, said he was not quite ready leave. ''If it jumps the railroad and the highway, I'm leaving,'' Mr. Corbitt said. His neighbor Edward Oliver, 45, a blueberry farmer who has lived in Manor for 14 years, chose to stand his ground to protect his house. ''I got a sprinkler on it right now,'' Mr. Oliver said. ''In case the ash will fall, you know.'' He also used a bulldozer to plow a four-foot-wide firebreak around his 10-acre property. ''It's all going to depend on the wind,'' he added. ''This is my whole life. I hope it don't burn.''"
"For a few days, it seemed as if Don Imus would somehow pull out of the death spiral. After all, once he came under fire, Mr. Imus said he was sorry for the racial insult, said he was sorry again and then began a week of penance, raising money on his own show for sick children and turning up at various other microphones to renew his apology. But even as he went through the ritual of public mortification, his backers began to see what he did not: the drumbeat was not going to stop. The controversy metastasized and by Monday, the media began to lock and load. Mr. Imus, who had shrugged off the initial criticism last week, was fighting for survival. ''All the elements were there,'' said James Carville, the political consultant who has appeared on the show and has seen a few stories blow up in his time. ''You had some dry brush, gasoline, high winds, no rain and low humidity and before you know it, man, it was a wildfire.'' The toxicity of Mr. Imus's remark, the innocence of his targets, and his refusal to put down the shovel -- he dug himself deeper just about every time he opened his mouth -- made last night's decision by CBS to end his show seem almost inevitable. Disparate media imperatives were at work, but they converged and whipsawed into a self-sustaining frenzy. OLD MEETS NEW -- Mr. Imus is an old-school radio guy caught in a very modern media paradigm. When he started 30 years ago, if he made the same kind of remark, it would have floated off into the ether -- the Federal Communications Commission, if it received complaints, might have taken notice, but few others. But radio is now visible -- Mr. Imus's show was simulcast on MSNBC, and more to the point, it is downloadable. By Friday, reporters and advocates could click up the remark on the Media Matters for America Web site, and later YouTube, and see a vicious racial insult that delighted him visibly as it rolled off his tongue. The ether now has a memory. IDLE HANDS -- An awareness of Mr. Imus's ''nappy-headed hos'' remark grew on Friday, just as editors and reporters in both print and broadcast were staring down Good Friday and Easter. Filling up post-holiday reports is always a chore and there stood Mr. Imus, backpedaling and apologizing to anyone who would listen. The media apparatus, at loose ends, kicked in with a vengeance. AN A-LIST MOMENT -- Most of the time when shock jocks step over the line, they are surrounded by a cadre of faceless enablers. Mr. Imus, because of his manifest interests, played host to the cream of journalism and politics. He may not have the biggest numbers in broadcasting, but his ability to book the likes of Senator John McCain and Tim Russert of NBC News means that he became a far worthier target. When most radio talkers go off the rails, the only question is whether advertisers will pull back. In this instance, his guests were implicated; whether they would return to the show became an issue of public moment. THE WRONG VICTIMS -- Speaking of targets, Mr. Imus chose poorly. ''Imus has a long history of saying far more negative, divisive things,'' said Robert M. Entman, a professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. ''In this case, he chose a college basketball team. College athletics is sacred in our culture in a way. We tell ourselves that it is a place that we have transcended race. This was an attack on the purity of sport, student athletes who are not paid to perform. In picking on a whole team, he chose the wrong noun to go with the adjectives.'' He also picked on the wrong coach. C. Vivian Stringer protects her posse; her eloquent, aggressive defense of the team -- and the obvious class of the players at the podium -- made for riveting television with a great deal of emotional content. The Rutgers institutional decision to treat the affair as a teachable moment put Mr. Imus in an even deeper hole. SHARPTON'S WHEELHOUSE -- Should Mr. Imus have stepped to the mouth of the lion on Monday and appeared on the Rev. Al Sharpton's radio show, which effectively became a cable television show broadcast everywhere? Probably not. Mr. Imus gave the story stout legs by seeming to lose his cool on the show by calling his interrogators ''you people,'' a hoary racial trope. What looked like an effort to build a ledge became another trapdoor. Mr. Imus might have learned by watching Michael Richards -- another public figure whose racial remarks hit the YouTube megaphone -- who went on the Rev. Jesse Jackson's show and was left in a steaming heap. By seeking absolution from people with their own political agenda, Mr. Imus lost custody of his apology. AN ARGUMENT WITHOUT END -- Sexism comes and goes on the Imus show, and all over the culture for that matter -- but a visceral debate over racism in America is always there, waiting. ''There is an insatiable appetite for race-related discourse in the country,'' said Edward Wasserman, a journalism professor at Washington and Lee University. ''Imus is just a barstool bigot, but there is such a river of anxiety about race in the culture that it doesn't take much to tap into it.'' CASTING -- News thrives on the same thing entertainment does: character and narrative. In this case, a barely repentant curmudgeon had effectively mugged Cinderella. ''It is a perfect story,'' said Martin Kaplan, a professor of media and entertainment at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California. ''You have a grizzled cowboy up against innocent victims.'' Mr. Jackson and Mr. Sharpton might have résumés at odds with their status as avatars of racial rectitude, but Essence Carson, a junior with a soft hand for both the piano and the jump shot, carried no such baggage when she suggested that Mr. Imus had some explaining to do. ''The Rutgers women's team this year will go down as one of the most famous teams in history, like the '71 Nebraska team,'' Mr. Carville said. After listening to Mr. Imus on the ''Today'' show, Al Roker, the weatherman who is the very picture of America's jolly uncle, made it plain in a post on his blog: ''CBS Radio and NBC News need to remove Don Imus from the airwaves.'' Who countered for Mr. Imus? The cadre of white, accomplished males who have been his running buddies for years. He may have black friends, but they don't show up on his show much and that broadcast apartheid left him without meaningful allies. Mr. Imus was alone and ineffective in his defense, after years of being surrounded by sycophancy that has left him reflexively entitled and ill-prepared for media opportunities in which he does not control the microphone. A SPANKING MACHINE WITH NO EXIT -- Time heals, time forgets, but Mr. Imus was seeking to shore up his career immediately. Mr. Imus never caught a breath because he was in the middle of a 24-hour news cycle that kept him in the cross hairs. It is the kind of media ceremony that generally ends in a human sacrifice. THE MEDIA EQUATION"
"The hills and palm trees have turned sepia, the winds crackle and the skin of many Angelenos, with the texture and appearance of unpeeled onions, needs a slathering of cream. The winter rainy season here has been the driest in well over a century. Much of Southern California and broad swaths of the West are also suffering -- and fearing next a season of virulent fires. Since last July, it has rained a mere 2.4 inches in downtown Los Angeles, far below the 15-inch average for the same period, the driest it has been since 1877. The already arid Antelope Valley just north of the city has had about 10 percent of its normal rainfall -- less than an inch -- and Burbank is barely better off. The state's overall snow pack is about 40 percent of its normal level, the lowest since 1988. Throughout the West, a dry winter has parched places like Phoenix and Reno, Nev., where roughly half the normal amount of rain has fallen. But the situation in Southern California is particularly egregious. Every morning brings another grim march toward the lawn sprinklers and twitchy glances toward the ever-flammable hills. ''Southern California has been really hard hit,'' said Elissa Lynn, a senior meteorologist at the California Department of Water Resources. Thanks to heavy rains last year, particularly in the north, Ms. Lynn said, the state's reservoirs remain in good shape and a serious drought is not in the offing. But the dry weather, compounded by dry vegetation left by an unusually harsh freeze over the winter and a very windy spring have raised the specter of frequent powerful fires throughout Southern California. ''You have very dry, very dead fuel out there,'' said Jamie Meier, a meteorologist with the Los Angeles office of the National Weather Service. ''It has the potential to be a difficult fire season.'' Brush fires, less common in the winter months, have been numerous this year. There have been more than a dozen in Ventura County alone. Last week, three homes burned in Beverly Hills, where flames were whipped by unseasonably high winds. Ventura County never ended the official fire season that began last spring and now is bracing for a tough summer. ''Fire season is a year-round event for us now,'' said Bob Roper, fire chief for Ventura County. ''Right now what we're seeing is that the fuel conditions are already at a critical level and Southern California has had a lot of wind conditions. All I can say is conditions are present to have a really bad season.'' The normal fire season in Southern California tends to begin at the end of May, but many local departments said they will start the official season at the end of this month. Firefighters will respond in greater numbers to calls around the state and monitor weather conditions closely. Near the Hollywood sign, where a brush fire burned nearby this spring, the dried brush and sand have combined to create a landscape more like the high desert's than like the postcard image of palm trees with dabs of green. Now, its hill is a tinderbox looming over the city. A lack of green plant life, which retards fire growth, raises further concerns among fire officials. ''Certainly looking at the numbers and looking at the vegetation, it looks July already out there,'' said John R. Todd, chief of the forestry division of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. ''Another building concern is that we had a huge rain year in 2005 and all that growth is available to become fuel.'' A lack of precipitation has crinkled plants, shortened ski seasons and withered the land in large sections of Arizona, Nevada, eastern regions in Oregon, and parts of northern Utah and southern Idaho, said Kelly T. Redmond, regional climatologist at the Western Regional Climate Center in Reno. Flagstaff, Ariz., for instance, has had almost half its usual 105 inches of snow this season. Only 2.2 inches of rain has fallen in Reno since Oct. 1, about 43 percent of normal levels. Two previous wet winters have kept the reservoirs along the Sierra Nevada amply supplied, enough to offset the effects of this dry season, Mr. Redmond said. ''A lot of the water interests are now looking ahead to next winter,'' Mr. Redmond added. ''If they get a second winter like this, they are going to be in a world of hurt.'' There are beneficiaries of the dry winter. Julia Sandoval, an aesthetician at the Ra Organic Spa in Burbank, has been living it up with creams containing alpha lipoic acid, an antioxidant. ''I have seen the dry season reflected on everyone's skin who comes in,'' Ms. Sandoval said."
"Recently, I flew from Denver to Ontario, Calif. The next-to-last leg of that flight is mostly over desert, and at night the desert floor means darkness. Then we came over the mountains, and in the distance I could see a dim line of lights slowly rising to fill the horizon, the leading edge of the luminosity that is Southern California at night. Before long we were descending, wheels down, over a district of low, flat buildings, enormous in scale, their parking lots and loading bays gleaming under mercury and sodium lamps. But what caught my eye just before we landed was another kind of light. It was the ragged edge of a wildfire off to the south, probably the Gypsum fire near Yorba Linda. It was dull orange, highly variable, often obscured by its own smoke and then flaring brightly once again. There was no geometry, no steadiness to it, and that lack of proportion and symmetry was as much a part of the fire's wildness as the fact that it had escaped from human control. Other wildfires have been burning around the region, too, in Griffith Park and on Catalina Island. These have been widely scattered burns, but they raise the fear of a different kind of fire -- the kind that begins in separate places with separate names but merges into a single conflagration and is best remembered by the year itself, the way 1988 is remembered in Yellowstone. This year may well bring that kind of fire to Southern California. It is the driest year in the last 120 years. The hills are just waiting to go up. The question is what else will go up with them. The sight of that wildfire has stuck in my mind. It took the form of a wavering, shallow V on a distant hillside, and, of course, it reminded me of other wildfires I have seen. But whatever that fire was in itself -- and it was contained by the next morning -- it also helped me visualize global warming in a more literal way than I ever have. I suddenly saw that there are fires everywhere, all around us all the time, but fires so wholly controlled that we no longer think of them as fire at all. I drove back to my college town that night along the San Bernardino Freeway. The traffic was light and lulling. But there were fires burning in the engines of every vehicle I saw. The lights in our quiet town were themselves a serene combustion, waypoints along a nearly infinite electrical grid that is itself a kind of wire-drawn fire. I got home and saw the porch light burning, its filament kindling in the darkness. The dull-orange haze of night in Los Angeles was the transposed heat of millions of domesticated fires. A picture came to mind -- the familiar sight of a gas flare at the top of the refinery stack in Laurel, Mont., a wavering flame of unwanted gas lighting up the night. I remembered a passage from the journals of John Cheever -- a paragraph from 1954 describing ''the winter fires of New York burning like the gnats in Benares,'' the incinerating of mattresses, wooden crates, cardboard cartons, uptown and down. It began to seem to me that we are a species of fire-starters, and that all of our imprisoned fires are just so many versions of yet another cook-fire on the edge of night in a land where fuel has grown scarce from all the cook-fires of all the people. I thought about this sudden vision for a couple of days. At first, it seemed almost overwhelming. I tried to picture all the combustions that are essential to the human ways of life in all their global diversity. I wondered what Earth would look like from our neighborhood in space if we could see all our incandescences, in all their forms, glowing at once. There would be only a faint corona of anthropogenic combustion, but it would be more than enough to have begun overwhelming the atmosphere, which is, after all, such a thin, faint halo around this planet. The image of the cook-fire kept coming back to mind -- the cook-fires I saw burning last June in a village in Tanzania, where every day the problem of fuel presented itself all over again. Sooner or later a wildfire burns itself out for lack of fuel. The question, I suppose, is whether our species will do the same. We will see what the summer brings in the way of wildfires in Southern California -- and, still worse, what October brings when the winds really begin to stir. The drought that afflicts the region probably has nothing to do with global warming. It may simply be part of the natural pattern of wet and dry cycles in the Southwest. If the hills do go up in smoke, they will add their carbon load to the atmosphere, and it will perhaps crystallize in our minds the effect of all our more domesticated flames. But, eventually, the wildfires will die down, and life will return to normal and that momentary vision will subside. Editorial Observer Correction: May 25, 2007, Friday In the May 23 Editorial Observer about fires in California: John Cheever's journal mentioned burning ghats, not burning gnats. Ghats are stairs from temples to the Ganges River in India, where Hindus traditionally construct funeral pyres. Gnats, of course, are tiny insects."
"A flare dropped by an F-16 fighter jet at a bombing range in southern New Jersey ignited a wildfire yesterday that burned thousands of acres of brush and pine forest, closed highways, forced thousands of residents to flee and damaged some homes, state officials said. By late last night, about 12,000 acres along the border of Ocean and Burlington Counties had burned, firefighters said, and only 10 percent of the fire had been contained. About 2,500 people had been forced from their houses, and three senior citizens' homes also had been evacuated, officials said. The blaze began shortly after 2 p.m. when an F-16 flying on a routine training mission from an air base in Atlantic City dropped a flare at the Warren Grove Gunnery Range in Ocean County, said Lt. Col. James Garcia, a spokesman for the New Jersey Air National Guard. The warplane was attached to the 177th Fighter Wing, based at the Atlantic City airport, and was practicing the use of a self-defense system in which flares are fired as decoys to mislead heat-seeking missiles, Colonel Garcia said. The flames spread quickly from the range to the surrounding pinelands, forcing the evacuations in Barnegat, Stafford, Woodland and Little Egg Harbor Townships. About 500 people were asked to spend the night in shelters set up at Southern Regional High School in Manahawkin and at a middle school in Barnegat, officials said. Fire officials said that about 1,000 local, state and federal firefighters were battling the blaze. One of their jobs was to set small fires that were intended to destroy flammable materials in the path of the flames. ''This is one of the larger fires we've had for quite a few years,'' said Maris Gabliks, chief of the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. Chief Gabliks said that warm temperatures, low humidity and high winds fueled the blaze. Brenda Schoeneberg, 46, of Warren Grove, said the authorities arrived at her house about 3 p.m. and told her she had 10 minutes to flee. She stuffed some photos, her medications and insurance papers in the car and drove away. By nightfall, she had returned. ''I panicked,'' she said. Late last night, Angela Kyme, 43, of Warren Grove, was still at home, where she stood staring at the tree line. She said she heard the fire alarms in town go off around 3 p.m. ''Then I went outside and looked up and saw the dark clouds,'' she said. ''It was pretty scary.'' New Jersey State Police officials said that Routes 72 and 539 were closed and that Exits 63, 67 and 69 on the Garden State Parkway were also shut down to help with the evacuation. Some of the roads might remain closed through this morning's rush, they said. Three years ago, another F-16 accidentally fired eight rounds from a high-powered 20-millimeter cannon through the roof of Little Egg Harbor Intermediate School, just three miles south of the range. The incident took place at night, and no one was hurt; the damage to the school was minor. In 2002, errant practice bombs at the range sparked a small fire that burned about 11,000 acres. Another fire that started at the range destroyed 1,600 acres of the pinelands in 1999."
"Two days after fleeing 20-foot flames that licked at their backyards here, residents began returning to their mobile homes Thursday, though some came back to piles of charred rubble where their homes once stood. Despite warnings that the wildfire was not fully contained, more than 5,000 residents were allowed to return home after Wednesday night's fast-moving rainstorm helped douse the flames. The fire has burned 14,000 acres of forest since Tuesday, and the authorities believe that it was touched off by a flare from a military jet on a training run. ''We still have some unburned pockets within our perimeters, and we need to make sure they don't pick up again,'' said the state fire warden, Maris Gabliks, noting that high winds threatened to reignite hot spots. Mr. Gabliks said that 70 percent of the fire was contained on Thursday, and that he expected it to be fully contained by Friday morning. Although half an inch of rain had helped in suppressing the fire -- which had as many as 1,000 people battling it at one point -- he said an additional two inches would finish the job. Mr. Gabliks added that heavy vegetation and logs could be masking smoldering coals, mostly in the developed swath between Routes 539 and 72. While residents were initially relieved to be returning, it was a bittersweet homecoming. At the Brighton at Barnegat and Pinewood Estates mobile home parks on Route 72, homeowners shared stories of their hurried evacuation as they took in the damage. ''I was afraid to come back,'' said Edith Podchaski, a 19-year resident of Brighton at Barnegat. ''They told us 15 homes were wiped out, but we didn't know which ones until we got back here.'' Mrs. Podchaski was relieved to find her mobile home unharmed, but a friend, Lester Balkie, was not as fortunate. Mr. Balkie, an 85-year-old Navy veteran, was struck nearly speechless by the burned rubble at 83 Brighton Road that had been his home. ''It's been a bad couple of years,'' said Mr. Balkie, whose wife died of cancer last fall. While Mr. Balkie sat in a beach chair nibbling on a cookie, his relatives dug through the black char, trying to find anything of value in the remains of his home of 23 years. By midday, they had recovered a Navy ring his wife had given him in 1942 and an antique Winchester rifle, part of a collection. Mr. Balkie said the rifle was worth $1,000 before it was burned. At the Pinewood Estates mobile home park next door, Joe and Ruth Miller were also shaken to find the back half of their trailer home melted away when they returned on Thursday. ''Coming down the road, it didn't look so bad. Then when we got closer, we were devastated,'' Mr. Miller said. While both mobile home parks cater to people 55 and older, most of the residents are significantly older, and in many cases, in poor health, and being ordered to evacuate in 10 minutes was a challenge. Helen Selwyn said she had just come back from having a cancer biopsy on Tuesday when she was told she had to leave. ''I was able to drive,'' Ms. Selwyn said. ''I knocked down some mailboxes, but I made it out.'' Three investigations are under way to determine the cause of the fire, which is believed to have started after a flare was dropped from an F-16 onto the Pinelands during a routine exercise at the Warren Grove Gunnery Range, a training ground for the New Jersey Air National Guard. Maj. Gen. Glenn K. Reith of the New Jersey Air National Guard announced on Thursday that the Air Force would provide initial emergency relief of up to $25,000 for those whose homes were damaged or destroyed. Mr. Gabliks said that residents were being asked to provide photographs of the damage in order to collect relief funds. If the investigations confirm that the errant flare caused the fire, he said, the Air National Guard would be responsible not only for the damage to the homes, but also for the cost of fighting the fire."
"The second major Southern California brushfire this week continued to burn Friday on the resort island of Santa Catalina. But Avalon, the island's major town, appeared to have been spared, and some of the thousands of people who had been evacuated began returning from the mainland. The fire, whose cause remains undetermined, broke out Thursday afternoon and for a time threatened Avalon, which has a population of about 3,300. But hundreds of firefighters, aided by dampening air, wind shifts and a swarm of helicopters and planes dropping water and fire retardant, beat back the blaze. By late Friday afternoon it was confined to the tinder-dry mountains of the island, about 25 miles off the coast. Only one house and a handful of small structures had burned, and no serious injuries were reported. A herd of bison, whose forebears were taken to Catalina decades ago for a movie shoot, were reported safe. So were four newly hatched eaglets, whose birth was a milestone for an eagle restoration program in the Channel Islands. Still, the fire has so far charred more than 4,200 acres of the narrow, 76-square-mile island, whose vast hilly parkland, abundant wildlife and winding cobblestone roads dotted with colorful bungalows make it a favorite getaway for Angelenos. In all, perhaps 3,800 people, including tourists, were evacuated overnight from Catalina and brought here to Long Beach aboard ferries. About 140 of them spent Thursday night at a high school here. While the evacuees were headed in this direction, a firefighting army was headed in the other. Military hovercraft had to be used to carry dozens of firetrucks and other apparatus to the island. More than 700 firefighters, 44 fire engines, 9 helicopters and 5 airplanes from state, federal and local agencies fought the blaze. Many of the evacuees were workers with family roots in the Mexican state of Jalisco, and representatives from the Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles arrived in Long Beach to assist them. One of them, Elsa Contreras, 33, who evacuated with her husband and their seven children, said, ''When we got on the boat, we were in a panic because we could feel the heat in the air.'' ''It was very stressful, getting all the children,'' Ms. Contreras said. ''I didn't want to leave separately without my husband and children.'' Rogelio Hernandez, 33, who evacuated with his wife and 2-year-old son, said the police had given residents of his apartment building five minutes to leave as flames approached Thursday. The fire was a testament to just how dry the region is, having received only two inches of rain since January. It broke out the same week as a blaze that burned a large part of 4,200-acre Griffith Park in Los Angeles, one of the biggest municipal parks in the country."
"WHILE television sets across the country were showing forests ablaze and firefighters frantically dousing flames during the weeklong inferno that burned more than 17,000 acres in the New Jersey Pinelands, a few more subtle events were happening far from the cameras' lenses. Pine snakes and corn snakes were burrowing deep into the loamy sands, huddling well below the fire and preserving themselves for its aftermath. Deer were leaping just ahead of the flames, the does trying to push along their fawns, some of whom were only days old. In the wake of the flames, the pygmy pines of the Warren Grove area, the one most affected by the fires, had their cones open up almost magically -- an adaptation to the frequent fires in the 1.1-million-acre Pine Barrens. The heat melted the resins holding the cones together, allowing them to burst and send out seeds to start the regeneration of the forests. ''Not that this was a wonderful natural event, but we will no doubt get to see the resiliency of the Pine Barrens forest ecology,'' said Dr. Richard G. Lathrop Jr., director of the Grant F. Walton Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis at the Rutgers School of Environmental and Biological Sciences, which studies the Pinelands area. ''The system bounces back. Fire has been a part of that area for a long time. There you find species that have adapted to frequent fires; otherwise they get outcompeted by species that can.'' This fire is believed to have started after a flare was dropped from an F-16 during a routine exercise at the Warren Grove Gunnery Range, a training ground for the New Jersey Air National Guard. Last Tuesday, Gov. Jon S. Corzine called for the range's closing. The fire was one of 760 to which the New Jersey Forest Fire Service said it had responded this year through last Monday. The most common causes were arson (40 percent), children (17 percent) and careless smoking (9 percent). While fire can be a problem for those living in or near the Pine Barrens, development in and of itself does not cause any substantial increase in fires, Dr. Lathrop said. Development there is regulated by the State Pinelands Commission's Comprehensive Management Plan. The last fire in the Pinelands comparable to the one this month was in 1995, when 19,500 acres burned, said John L. Hom, the regional deputy program manager for the United States Forest Service's Global Change Program, which monitors development and ecological matters in the Pinelands and other sensitive areas. That was nothing compared to the 190,000 acres that burned in the Pine Barrens in a 1963 fire. ''Fire is a natural part of the ecology and we should expect these kinds of big fires,'' Dr. Hom said. ''The vegetation is generally coniferous and the needles are highly flammable. The fire gets up into the canopies of these trees and spreads. In some ways, it is only strange that we have had so few big fires.'' Carleton Montgomery, the executive director of the Pinelands Preservation Alliance, a Southampton-based watchdog group, said he took several walks through burned areas and found it strangely exhilarating. He said he saw areas ''where everything was blackened'' -- trees, leaves and needles on the ground -- adjacent to areas that were untouched. ''You already see the mosaic effect of how fire sweeps through a forest,'' he said. ''There are young trees growing up next to mature stands, and with a fire like this, the situation can be quickly reversed, with burned old trees. It's exciting.'' Mr. Montgomery and Dr. Lathrop agreed that the Pine Barrens are susceptible to fires because of the original natural surroundings and the way the trees have adapted to fires. The generally sandy floor of the Pine Barrens does not easily hold water or organic material that would mitigate the spread of fire. Mr. Montgomery said that while the pitch pine, the dominant species in the area, has needles that are flammable, ''it also has the fire-resistant bark and that ability to resprout new growth from the root and trunk of the tree.'' Dr. Lathrop said that as early as summer, the trees will start sprouting buds and stems. Within a few years, there may well be thick, if short, stands of trees in what may now appear to be the most devastated areas of the pine forest. Dr. Hom said the Warren Grove area has generally been known as a forest of pygmy pines. It is unclear, he said, whether those pines do not naturally grow as tall as surrounding forests or have not had much chance to grow because the usual cycle of fires there is about 5 to 15 years. It may well be a combination, he said, that they have adapted to the fire cycle and have stopped growing taller as a result. In any case, Dr. Hom said, fire will continue to be a hazard. He said he hoped that with the continued pressure to build in or near the Pinelands, those who choose to build and live there are aware of that reality. ''Part of the problem in dealing with this fire is that firefighters had to worry about saving property near the blazes,'' he said. ''Each time, that took an engine or some men away from fighting the fire itself. If we want to preserve this area, we have to be careful about how we live near it.'' RECOVERY"
"As hundreds of firefighters battled for the second day to control a huge wildfire touched off by a flare at a military firing range on the edge of the Pine Barrens in southern New Jersey, some of those who live near the blaze questioned yesterday whether more safety precautions should be put in place. The fire -- which by last night had turned about 13,500 acres into a roaring inferno -- was the fourth time in the last eight years that military exercises in the area have left residents feeling as if they live in a war zone. ''I don't think they should be doing it,'' said Brenda Schoeneberg, 46, on Tuesday evening as she prepared to evacuate her sprawling neo-Colonial home in Warren Grove, N.J., where a stand of pine trees was silhouetted against the blaze 200 yards away. A live flare from an F-16 fighter jet on a training mission at the nearby Warren Grove Gunnery Range on Tuesday afternoon had sent Ms. Schoenberg and more than 2,500 others fleeing, including dozens of residents of nearby nursing homes. In 2004, another F-16 fired at least eight rounds from a high-powered 20-millimeter cannon through the roof of an elementary school in Little Egg Harbor Township, about three miles from the range. No one was hurt in that episode, which occurred at night, and damage to the school was minimal. In 2002, errant bombs touched off a fire that scorched about 11,000 acres, and in 1999 a fire at the range destroyed about 1,600 acres of the Pinelands. At the least, said Diane Lohr, 45, another resident of Warren Grove, a tiny community tucked on the southeast edge of the 1.1 million-acre Pine Barrens, the military should be more sensitive to risks of fire amid windy, dry conditions. The authorities said those two factors had caused the latest blaze to spread rapidly. Despite the risks, the military said that the accidental fire would not deter them from conducting future training missions and that it had no plans to move the firing range, which has been used by the military for more than 40 years. ''It's a vital function those marines are doing for our country,'' said Maj. Gen. Glenn Reith of the New Jersey Air National Guard. Two A-10 fighter jets from the Pennsylvania Air National Guard and two F-16s from New Jersey were conducting a practice mission when the fire started. A spokesman for the range, Kryn Westhoven, said that the base had held meetings with residents of towns near the range after the earlier episodes and had taken steps to address their concerns. ''I understand residents' concerns about the range,'' Mr. Westhoven said. ''We're proactive down here.'' Mr. Westhoven said that the military had a buffer zone around the range and said that the site had been chosen by the military because it was so isolated. ''It is in the Pinelands, in a pretty remote area,'' he said. The area near the range, about 25 miles north of Atlantic City, is far more developed than it was when the military began conducting training missions there in the early 1960s. Some here said that they knew the risks before choosing to settle in the area. Bob Wilson, 67, a tractor-trailer driver who grew up in the area and moved to Warren Grove in 1970, said the bombing range was something residents had just gotten used to. ''It's a fact of life,'' he said. ''We knew they wouldn't move the bombing range. It was here when we moved here.'' The blaze was slowly being brought under control yesterday by more than 1,000 firefighters and emergency workers from five counties. Fire officials said that 90 minutes of heavy rain last night helped douse many of the flames. The authorities said they had begun scaling back firefighting operations and had about 30 percent of the blaze under control. No one had been hurt in the fire, but about a dozen homes had been damaged or destroyed. Although annoyed by the evacuations, some in the area saw the threat of fire as another part of life in this rural swath of southern New Jersey. The Pine Barrens itself is a rare, heavily forested ecosystem spread over parts of Burlington, Ocean, Atlantic, Cape May and Cumberland Counties -- the largest piece of open space between Boston and Richmond, Va. -- with an uncommon variety of plant life. John Kertland, 43, a computer technician who has lived in Warren Grove for 10 years, said that although the bombing at the range ''kind of destroys the serenity around here,'' he tries not to think about that, or the fire danger. ''Wherever you live you're going to have something,'' Mr. Kertland said. ''Here it's fires, but I don't dwell on it.'' Despite the threat, Ms. Lohr said fires are rare and not bad enough to affect the quality of life in Warren Cove. ''For 364 days a year,'' she said, ''it's beautiful here.''"
"A stubborn brush fire burned nearly a fifth of Griffith Park, among the largest municipal parks in the country, before firefighters brought the blaze under control on Wednesday. Only one home was lightly damaged, and landmarks like the Los Angeles Zoo and the Griffith Observatory were spared, though the park, a 4,200-acre hilly getaway with ribbons of trails and breathtaking views, will remain closed through Thursday. Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa said the blaze heralded a severe fire season, with unusually dry weather raising the potential for more large fires. The park and nearby areas have had several fires in recent months, and officials said this fire, the largest in the park in many years, could have been catastrophic had winds been stronger. ''We face an extremely dangerous fire season,'' Mr. Villaraigosa said at a news conference in the park, where he was surrounded by still-smoldering hillsides. ''We must ask the public to be extremely vigilant.'' By midafternoon, the fire was under control, he said; it was later pronounced 75 percent contained, meaning firefighters were most of the way toward surrounding it with lines to block its spread. Several park trails were heavily damaged, and a popular garden, Dante's View, was destroyed, said Councilman Tom LaBonge, who represents the area. The cause of the fire was not known. A man injured in the fire near where it started on Tuesday was cited for smoking in a restricted area, but what role if any he played in setting it off had not been determined, Chief Douglas Barry of the Fire Department said. Chief Barry said the department took the unusual step of using water-dropping helicopters well into the night, stopping them only when fatigue made flights dangerous. He said he expected the fire to be fully contained sometime Thursday. The fire burned more than 800 acres, largely in the southeast corner of the park, which lies northwest of downtown Los Angeles between Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley. About 300 people in the nearby neighborhood of Los Feliz were evacuated overnight as flames advanced on hills near their parkside homes; most residents had returned by midday on Wednesday. Anthony Dominici, 37, a television producer whose family home in New Orleans was severely damaged in Hurricane Katrina, said he nervously watched the fire near his house until heeding police warnings to leave, making sure to pack photographs. ''We were re-rescuing things from Katrina, like family photos,'' Mr. Dominici said. ''From the Katrina experience, you realize that the most important things to try to rescue are photos of family, like a 1903 photo of my family from New Orleans.'' His wife, Georgia Archer, 43, added, ''Pretty much everything else can be replaced.'' About 25 people, mostly elderly, spent the night in a Red Cross shelter in the Los Feliz neighborhood. Rich Keller, a 14-year resident of Shannon Road, the only street still under evacuation orders, said he was eager to return home. Mr. Keller watched Tuesday afternoon as the fire seemed to die down and then flared up, forcing him and his wife to flee. This morning, he watched as the smoke died down and helicopters and planes swirled overhead, dumping water and fire retardant. ''I'm not too worried about the house now, but I would just like to get home,'' he said. The Fire Department deployed a few hundred firefighters and an array of equipment, fearing the fire would reach landmarks like the observatory, where tourists flock for views of the city and to see the bust of James Dean that commemorates ''Rebel Without a Cause,'' which was filmed there. The observatory reopened in November after a $93 million renovation and expansion. No zoo animals were harmed, and bird sanctuaries were spared. Griffith Park has occasionally experienced large brush fires. The city's deadliest fire, which killed 29 workers trying to put it out, occurred at the park in 1933."
"The Riverside County district attorney has decided to seek the death penalty against a man accused of starting a wildfire last year that killed five firefighters. Ingrid Wyatt, a spokeswoman for the district attorney, Rod Pacheco, said that he made the decision on Wednesday after meeting with family members of the firefighters, his assistants and law enforcement personnel involved in the investigation. Raymond L. Oyler has been charged with murder and 22 counts of arson for a series of fires including the fatal one, known as the Esperanza fire. He has pleaded not guilty and is expected to go on trial later this year or early next year. Ms. Wyatt said Mr. Pacheco weighed several factors, particularly the effect of the death of firefighters, who worked for the United States Forest Service, on their families and the large size of the fire, which burned 40,000 acres. ''You have five deaths, that's huge,'' she said. ''Then it's a huge impact on five different families, and also it's something that devastated the community here in Riverside County.'' Still, the decision did not come as a complete surprise. Riverside has one of the highest number of prisoners on death row of any California county, and Ms. Wyatt noted its ''conservative, law-and-order'' nature. The firefighters were killed when a sudden rush of flames overwhelmed them as they tried to save a house."
"Tuesday was a red-flag day in southeast Georgia, meaning that a continuing drought had turned low, scrubby underbrush into the ideal fuel for fires. The collective sense of humor had dried out, too. Along with signs that said ''Pray for rain'' and ''Thank you, firefighters,'' the residents of evacuation-weary Waycross, a town of 15,000 near the northern edge of a giant fire, asked via marquee, ''Are we done yet?'' The wildfire, the largest in Georgia history, broke out on April 16 and has scorched 18 houses and more than 101,000 acres. More than 900 firefighters from around the country were called in to help fight it, along with four others. ''My professional assessment is that I'm going to be here for a while,'' said Wayne Ichiyasu, a crew supervisor. ''This fuel is really volatile,'' Mr. Ichiyasu said, pointing to parched stands of trees. ''It doesn't take very much for it to light up and run.'' Mr. Ichiyasu, who has been lent by his home fire department in Boulder, Colo., is working to contain the eastern edge of the huge blaze, known as the Sweat Farm Road-Big Turnaround Fire, where it is already in Okefenokee Swamp; they are trying to keep it from jumping across Highway 1 into the community of Race Pond. ''We're not trying to put this fire out,'' said Kris A. Eriksen, manager of the Joint Fire Information Center in Waycross. ''We can't drop enough water on this fire to put this fire out,'' Ms. Eriksen said. ''We're just trying to steer it into the swamp.'' Moving the other parts of the fire into the swamp, and keeping it there, she added, would spare area communities further damage, while giving the swamp, parts of which have not burned in nearly 75 years, a house-cleaning. So far, the dry, windy weather -- with no rain in the forecast -- has not been helping. A storm expected to generate rain over the weekend produced lightning instead, igniting at least three blazes. The largest of those, the Bugaboo Island Fire, which started in the center of the swamp, was driven by wind out of the northeast and chewed through more than nine square miles of coastal pine forest on Monday at a pace of 95 feet per minute. By Tuesday morning, it had crossed into Florida, and officials there were forced to close Highway 2 and evacuate the town of Taylor. At least three more large fires were burning in Central Florida. The National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, said -- seven large fires were active in Florida, four in Georgia, two in Minnesota and two in North Carolina. In Los Angeles, a brush fire erupted in Griffith Park on Tuesday afternoon, forcing the evacuation of houses nearby and of landmarks in the park, including the newly refurbished Griffith Observatory, the Los Angeles Zoo and the Gene Autry Museum. Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa said at an afternoon news conference that about 200 firefighters were at the blaze, which had spread to about 150 acres of the 4,200-acre park, about six miles northwest of downtown. The fire seemed on its way to being contained in the early evening. But it flared anew after sunset as winds shifted, setting off scattered pockets of new fires and forcing the evacuation of scores of residents of the Los Feliz neighborhood south of the park, said Tom LaBonge, the councilman who represents the area. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power reported that more than 1,000 people had lost power. The fire department called in additional trucks and other equipment as crews scrambled to prevent the fire from reaching buildings in the park. Police officials said Tuesday evening that they were questioning a 20-year-old man in connection with the fire, adding that the man had been burned and was hospitalized. In Georgia, the Sweat Farm Road-Big Turnaround Fire remained the priority for crews because of its proximity to dozens of communities, major highways and rail lines along the Florida-Georgia border. Firefighters have used bulldozers to plough a perimeter around the western edge of the fire. Trees and bushes have been ripped out by the roots and pushed out of the way so that there is a line of dirt, maybe 20 feet across, to serve as a firebreak. Up and down the line, firefighters and water trucks were spaced every few feet. Men made small talk. Then the conversations stopped. Everybody was watching Glenn Hill, a firefighter from the Wildland Fire Service in Tallahassee, Fla., scramble to the base of an overturned tree. He sprayed the pine straw in front of him and then stood back, his eyes fixed and the nozzle of his hose extended. He looked like a hunting dog on point. ''No, you don't,'' Mr. Hill said to the fire. ''Not on my watch.''"
"After a Major Wildfire, It Seems, Some Forests Are Better Left Alone What to do with a forest after an extensive fire? The answer has often been to harvest the dead trees (in part to try to make up for economic losses caused by the fire) and plant seedlings to re-establish the forest. But there has been a growing debate as to whether salvage logging and replanting is the best post-fire approach. A study in southwestern Oregon suggests one reason it might not be: areas that are managed in this way tend to burn more severely the next time the forest catches fire. Jonathan R. Thompson of Oregon State University and colleagues studied an area in the Siskiyou Mountains near the coast. The area burned in 1987, and parts of it were logged and replanted with conifers. In August 2002 the area burned again in a huge blaze known as the Biscuit Fire. Using satellite images and forest management data, the researchers created a model to calculate the severity of fire in randomly selected plots. Their findings are published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In general, areas that burned severely in 1987 burned severely again 15 years later. But among these, the researchers found, areas that were left unmanaged had less devastation. Salvage logging leaves behind debris like treetops and branches that are a ready source of fuel, as are young conifer plantations, with their uniform growth. In unmanaged areas, the researchers say, regrowth is more diverse, and there are likely to be gaps that reduce fire severity. Froggy Went A-Raftin' From South America, Millions of Years Ago Scientists at Penn State have penciled in the branches of the evolutionary tree of a major group of frogs, the eleutherodactylines, in the process making a surprising discovery: the species dispersed from South America to Central America and the Caribbean over water, not land. There are roughly 800 species of eleutherodactylines, small frogs that, unlike many frogs found in temperate climates, lay their eggs on land. Scientists have not known how the species got from South America to the West Indies and Latin America and Mexico, but the prevailing theory was that they traveled across an ancient land mass between North and South America. Then about 70 or 80 million years ago this land mass moved eastward, taking some frogs with it (into what is now the Caribbean) and isolating the frogs to the north. But the new research, a genetic analysis of 300 species directed by S. Blair Hedges, a Penn State professor, shows that the Caribbean frogs diverged from a common South American ancestor much later than that -- in a single event 47 million to 29 million years ago. And the eleutherodactylines in Latin America and Mexico diverged from a South American ancestor 42 million to 31 million years ago. The findings, reported in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggest that in both cases frogs from South America traveled across the water, probably hitching a ride on floating vegetation. Warming in the Arctic? Blame the Snow. The Dirty Snow, That Is. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases get most of the blame for climate change. And rightly so, as they are by far the most dominant influence globally. But don't forget dirt. Building on research from earlier in the decade, scientists at the University of California, Irvine, have calculated the warming effect of soot falling on Arctic snow. And the result may come as a surprise: in the Arctic, dirty snow may be responsible for more warming than greenhouse gases. ''It turns out that nothing is more efficient at increasing the Earth's temperature than soot in snow,'' said Charles S. Zender, a professor of Earth system science at the university. Soot, from coal burning, inefficient cookstoves and forest and agricultural fires, falls in the Arctic, darkening snow. Dark colors absorb more sunlight than lighter colors and radiate more heat in return. Previous studies had looked at this basic effect and found that it contributed to regional warming. ''But they had probably underestimated the impact,'' Dr. Zender said. The new work, published in The Journal of Geophysical Research, takes a more detailed look at the effects of soot. Among other things, Dr. Zender said, it accelerates the ''aging'' of snow, as fine crystals turn into larger grains and the snow turns darker. (City dwellers are quite familiar with this phenomenon, as a bright white blanket turns to gray within days.) With this and other effects built into their model, the researchers found that over the past 200 years, dirty snow has been responsible for 0.5 to 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming in the Arctic. Over all, the region has warmed 1.6 degrees in that time. Dr. Zender said that several steps could be taken to reduce the impact. One is a matter of timing. If farmers must burn fields, for example, it's better to do it in the late summer and fall, when the impact on the snow cover will be less. More efficient cookstoves for villagers across Asia would also help. By burning cleaner, they would produce less soot. Conversely they would produce more carbon dioxide, ''but in this case emitting CO2 is the lesser of two evils,'' Dr. Zender said. Observatory Correction: June 14, 2007, Thursday An illustration with a short article in Science Times on Tuesday about the effect that soot in snow has on warming in the Arctic incorrectly included a penguin. Penguins do not live in the Arctic; the northernmost penguins are those on the Galápagos Islands, around the Equator."
"It is an understatement to say that the smoke jumpers from Redding, Calif., stuck out like a very green thumb in Central Park, scaling with the fluid motion of inch worms into the highest reaches of the maples, elms, ash, birch, willows, poplars and horse chestnuts in the park. Tethered to thick ropes and harnesses, they shinnied like monkeys from one branch to the next, carefully inspecting limbs. Leaves rustled in their wake. ''One police officer said, 'Now you're just part of the Central Park freak show,''' said one of the smoke jumpers, Adam Lauber, 34. On a recent afternoon, he carried an oversize slingshot to launch a throw line into the canopy of a 75-foot London plane at the south side of the Sheep Meadow. ''You get some people upset because we're in the trees,'' he said. Mr. Lauber is one of five smoke jumpers who are surveying the park as part of the federal government's program to eradicate the Asian long-horned beetle. Here the smoke jumpers will not need the global positioning systems and compasses that help them get their bearings when they parachute into remote wildernesses to fight fires in California, Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Montana. In New York, subway maps will do just fine. The smoke jumpers, who work for the United States Forest Service, were summoned east to help inspect the park's trees after the voracious beetle was discovered in trees at two Upper East Side locations that were considered too close for comfort to Manhattan's celebrated backyard. The smoke jumpers working in the park arrived this month, eager to take a break from repairing parachutes and sitting through classes on fire behavior during the downtime before the start of the fire season in the West. The Agriculture Department asked the Forest Service to take the job as part of a joint effort in place for several years to search for long-horned beetles in the New York area. Although Agriculture Department officials conduct ground inspections of trees in Central Park with binoculars, they need a closer scrutiny to declare trees beetle free. The smoke jumpers not only know the way around fires but also the way up and down trees. After surveying 1,150 trees, about 75 percent of the kinds of trees that the beetles like to devour, the smoke jumpers, on 12-hour shifts, found one infested with larvae. Yesterday the Agriculture Department confirmed that it was beetle larvae and said the infested tree, an elm at Fifth Avenue between 70th and 71st Streets, would be cut down and burned. ''We're making a difference,'' said John Casey, who leads a squad of the smoke jumpers. ''Tree climbing is the only true accurate way to know whether a tree is infested.'' His team will leave in mid-May when they have to head back home to fight forest fires. There are about 500 smoke jumpers scattered across the Western States on nine bases. Their busiest and most perilous time is from May to October. In Redding, where Mr. Casey's squad is based and where Mount Shasta soars just to the north, the men pass the time between fires fishing for salmon and trout or kayaking. On a recent afternoon in the park, the smoke jumpers, athletic men in their late 20's to mid-30's, seemed to be enjoying themselves, scooting up trees, hanging from branches and searching for the menacing beetle. It takes about a half-hour to inspect a tree, depending on its size. Some passers-by call out questions, trying to figure out what the men are doing. ''We'll tell them what we do, and they will tell us about the city and they're giving us the local knowledge,'' Mr. Casey said. ''It makes for good conversation.'' Some people do not notice them, while others treat the men like another New York attraction. ''A mass of people will come through and they don't even see us in the tree, or the people will see us and crowd around us,'' Mr. Casey said. ''We've become a part of the Central Park sightseeing.'' On this day, a group of youthful picnickers seemed oblivious to one smoke jumper, Don Graham, 27, who was directly over their heads in a London plane. One member of the group, Alida Ahmetaj, a 22-year-old Bronx resident, said he had noticed and thought the men were cutting down parts of the trees. One smoke jumper, Dylan Reeves, 31, has found that some New Yorkers have a paranoid side. ''Sometimes, people think we're installing cameras in the trees,'' he said. And it does not take much to push some New Yorkers' emotional buttons. Mr. Graham said he was screamed at by a man who accused him of killing a tree he was climbing. ''He said, 'What do you think you're doing?''' Mr. Graham said. When lunchtime rolled around, the smoke jumpers unloaded their gear in a park shed and cut across Broadway to the Time Warner Center. They took the escalator down to the Whole Foods market, fanning out among the multitude of salad bars and returning to the dining area with sushi and pizza. All five of them, who are staying at a Courtyard Marriott in Midtown, have visited New York at least once before. ''A lot of us are adventurous, and that applies to the city as well,'' said Mr. Casey, who is 35 and married to a personnel clerk in Redding. ''We look for adventure and finding different things that we aren't exposed to back home.'' Mr. Lauber, who is single, makes it clear that he would like some of that experience to include more women. He said he did meet Cameron Diaz at Whole Foods while buying a few slices of pizza. Even though scaling trees looking for bugs might not seem as dangerous as parachuting close to a raging fire, the men still take safety precautions. For this job, those measures reflect the urban setting. They place bright-orange safety cones so passers-by will know something is happening above and will steer a safe distance. They have gotten to know every species of dog in the park and know to grab their ground gear when the dogs come sniffing around. ''The dogs occasionally like to mark their territory on our cones,'' Mr. Casey said."
"Air Force officials made a final public plea on Saturday for their plan to overhaul more than two dozen Air National Guard units, warning that the squadrons would steadily become more ineffective and poorly equipped unless their proposal was approved. Testifying with other senior Pentagon officials at the last public hearing of the nine-member commission charged with assessing the Pentagon's base-closing plan, the Air Force chief of staff, Gen. John P. Jumper, warned that ''this round of closures and realignment represents the last opportunity we will have for a generation to reset our forces.'' The Air Force wants to retire aging aircraft from many Guard units, close or consolidate some of their bases and train some squadrons for new missions, like flying Predator drones, piloted by remote. But several commissioners suggested that the plan had become so politically controversial in states that would lose their aircraft that it might not survive intact when the commission begins voting on whether to accept the recommendations later this week. ''I've never seen so many governors united, whether Democrat or Republican, and angry about one particular item in my whole political career,'' said James H. Bilbray, a commission member from Nevada. Governors share authority with the president over the use of Air Guard units, which are frequently employed in fighting forest fires, recovering from hurricanes and responding to other natural disasters. Governors from states that would lose aircraft, along with state adjutants general who command the units, are arguing that the plan will degrade domestic security and leave them without enough aircraft nearby to respond to natural disasters. The commission is scheduled to begin voting Wednesday on accepting or rejecting each element of the Pentagon proposal, which would shut, consolidate or realign more than 800 military facilities in all 50 states. The panel, which includes retired military officers, former members of Congress and former cabinet members, has until Sept. 8 to submit its changes to President Bush. The president and Congress have until Nov. 7 to reject or accept the entire package. Several commissioners said they remained unconvinced by the Pentagon's claim that the plan would save nearly $50 billion over 20 years, an estimate that was challenged in a July report by the Government Accountability Office. But it was the Air National Guard portion of the plan that prompted the most debate. Anthony J. Principi, a former secretary of veterans affairs who is the commission's chairman, said the plan had opened a ''chasm'' between the Guard units slated to lose their aircraft and the Air Force leadership. That brought a sharp reply from General Jumper. ''We don't consider disagreements out there with a few adjutants general in the states to be a rift between the Air Force and the National Guard,'' he said."
"As Spain emerges from its worst summer of forest fires in a decade, the government has begun scolding the public for the careless and sometimes malicious behavior that specialists say causes the vast majority of fires here. Officials have been uncharacteristically blunt in recent weeks in emphasizing that more than 90 percent of the forest fires here are started by people, and that the problem will never be controlled until Spaniards begin to respect fire regulations. ''I am not going to apologize for saying that society is complicit in these fires,'' Cristina Narbona, the minister of environment, told reporters late last month. ''The ones that should apologize are the people that produce, tolerate and consent to these fires.'' About 23,000 forest fires had been recorded in Spain by last week, an increase of more than 25 percent over the same period last year, according to the Ministry of Environment. The flames have destroyed more than 370,000 acres of land, an increase of 20 percent, and killed 17 people. Spain endures the most destructive blazes in all of Europe, with nearly half the forest fires that occur each year in the European Union, according to a study by the Confederation of Workers' Commissions, a labor group that represents a large part of the government workers in the nation's forests. In part, that is a reflection of geography. Spain's dry climate and high temperatures make it vulnerable to fires. But only about 5 percent of the fires here stem from natural causes like lightning, the study found, with the rest caused by people. ''That is far higher than in other European countries,'' said Joaquín Nieto, the labor group's secretary for environment and worker health. ''Other than Portugal, which is similar to Spain, there is not as much human involvement in other countries.'' Portugal, which has the same dry weather as Spain, has lost about 4 percent of its woodlands to fires this year. The blazes have also killed at least 13 people there and destroyed scores of homes. It is not clear how many of the 45,000 forest fires throughout the European Union each year are caused by humans, although the number is estimated at more than half. Government officials in Spain have long been reluctant to assign blame, perhaps fearing a political backlash for pointing the finger at the public. But the unusually ferocious and deadly summer of fires has raised questions about whether the government is doing enough to address their causes. In July, 11 firefighters were killed by a blaze that was apparently started by a campfire in Guadalajara Province, east of Madrid. The government responded with tight restrictions on activities in public parks and woodlands, including a summer ban on smoking in forests. The government soon took more steps, which Ms. Narbona said were aimed at ''provoking a social debate'' on the role of the public in starting forest fires. She proposed staging plays to send messages about the importance of fire safety, called for school programs to teach children in rural areas about the danger of violating forest fire regulations and said new laws might also be necessary. But perhaps the central problems are the rampant disregard for safety regulations and the culture of complicity that keeps people from reporting violations, she said. ''It is fair to say that there is great impunity regarding forest fire crimes,'' the union study concludes, noting that only 1 percent of forest fires lead to an arrest. It calls for the appointment of environmental prosecutors who would specialize in the investigating forest fires. José Luis Herranz, the director for biodiversity at the Ministry of Environment, said arson accounted for only a small portion of the fires that are intentionally set. ''These fires are started mostly by farmers who are trying to remove brush and agricultural residues or by ranchers to regenerate pastures or drive away animals or to facilitate hunting,'' he said. ''They are also started to modify the use of the land,'' he said, referring to converting woodlands to pastures or clearing agricultural areas for urban use. ''The proliferation of fires in our country was serious as far back as the 13th century,'' he said. ''Fire has been a part of the culture of the Mediterranean since time immemorial.''"
"Fierce gusting winds transformed a small brush fire on Sunday into walls of flame that have destroyed 40 structures in this town in northern San Diego County and burned hundreds of acres at Camp Pendleton. The winds died down and the temperature fell today, and the fire was 50 percent contained by this evening. . Though still dangerous, it posed less of a threat to populated areas. Officials here said the fire was fanned out of control on Sunday by winds of more than 50 miles an hour, known as Santa Anas. Danny Hofshi, who works at the local fire department, said that making matters worse, the dry bed of the Santa Margarita River acted like a wind tunnel, accelerating the gusts. Fire officials said that more than 4,000 acres had burned and that about 200 families had been evacuated. Eleven civilians have been injured, none seriously. In addition to destroying the 40 structures -- expensive houses as well as farm buildings in avocado and orange groves -- the fire destroyed livestock and two fire trucks. Officials said weapons and munitions stored at Camp Pendleton, the 125,000-acre Marine Corps training base along the coast, were secure. Jordon Malarough, a fire inspector at Camp Pendleton, said the fire was moving away from storage areas and was burning open training fields.The nearby San Onofre nuclear power plant did not appear to be threatened. The swift violence of the fire was underscored by the experience of Richard and Sue Burke, who lived in what they called their dream house in the western part of Fallbrook, about 40 miles north of San Diego. Mrs. Burke was not home at the time. But Mr. Burke, a retired aerospace engineer who had just finished building the house two months ago, said he saw fire coming over a ridge around midday Sunday. ''It looked like it was going to pass us by, but then it came right back,'' he said. ''We went inside the house, but we heard sparks banging up against the windows, and that's when we decided we had to try to leave.'' Mr. Burke and a friend started to drive away but were blinded by smoke and returned to a dirt patch nearby to wait out the fire. Within minutes, the Burkes' home and most of their possessions were gone. Greg Liles, a farmer who moved to a 30-acre property in De Luz Canyon, north of Fallbrook, from Mississippi last October, lost some of his lime, lemon and eucalyptus trees to the fire. The flames also damaged a well, destroyed a pump house and melted power lines, irrigation lines and water pipes. ''It was spitting and snorting,'' he said. ''The fire came roaring out of the canyon, and it burned right up to about 30 feet from the house.'' Mr. Liles said his precious avocado trees were protected by firefighters from the California Department of Forestry. ''They saved our bacon,'' he said. In Fallbrook today, helicopters trailing large buckets of water could be seen crisscrossing the sky. About 700 firefighters have been mustered against the fire. Rick Mann, a spokesman for the Fallbrook fire department, said that the weather this afternoon had calmed, giving firefighters hope that the fire might be better contained by Tuesday morning. Winds had died down, Mr. Mann said, and the fire was burning toward the ocean. ''Everything depends on the weather at this point,'' he said."
"State water regulators bowed to the concerns of pool owners today and revised their drought rules to allow empty pools to be refilled for the summer. Under the drought water restrictions announced on Monday by Bradley M. Campbell, commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, pools that had been emptied for the winter could not be refilled from municipal water supplies, although owners could contract with water carriers to truck water to them. However, the cost for that option is very high, amounting to thousands of dollars for the average pool. The ban on filling empty pools was the only blanket regulation in a list of rules that allowed for filling newly built pools and pools emptied for repairs, or topping off pools that had been partially drained for the winter. The operators of large public and private pools had complained that the ban on refilling would force them to close for the summer, while pool builders had contended that confusion over the rules was hurting their businesses just as the warm months were approaching. In addition, Mr. Campbell asked all water companies serving populations greater than 10,000 to report how much water they are able to deliver through their current systems of pumps and pipes. He issued a general ban on open burning as a measure to prevent brush and forest fires. The rule does not apply to barbecues."
"There is nothing newfangled about Gayle Kaste. For 25 consecutive summers, despite two hip replacement operations and cataract surgery on both eyes, she has been working on a wooden tower here in the heavily forested northeast corner of Washington State. ''I call in every little smoke I see,'' said Mrs. Kaste, 74, known among local firefighters for spotting fires fast and locating them precisely. ''Heavens, I don't go anywhere without my field glasses.'' Mrs. Kaste is a fire lookout, practitioner of a craft that this summer is celebrating its 100th anniversary, having been invented in Bertha Hill, Idaho, when a timber camp cook was ordered to sit in a hilltop tree and look for smoke. Until recently, Mrs. Kaste's lonely calling had been steadily passing into history. Federal and state forestry agencies, seduced by the mobility of fire-spotting aircraft and the cost-effectiveness of satellites and electronic sensors, stopped staffing most of the more than 8,200 lookouts scattered across the United States. Some especially scenic lookouts were rented to tourists, but many others were abandoned, vandalized or burned down. The decades-old demise of the fire lookout, however, has been put on hold. As suburban-style homes are built ever deeper into the forests, fire experts are beginning to realize that people like Mrs. Kaste, in her Flagstaff Lookout, can be the cheapest and most reliable way to prevent exurbanites from burning up the woods, their houses and themselves. Many fire lookout stations go into operation across the country this Memorial Day weekend. ''We have been getting back to using some lookouts,'' said Buck Latapie, assistant director for fire and aviation management at United States Forest Service headquarters in Washington. ''In parts of the country where there is an increasing amount of human-caused fires, fire towers are better than regularly scheduled aerial surveillance.'' The Forest Service has no national numbers on how many federal and state lookouts have been refurbished and restaffed. But it says the trend, with some exceptions, is most pronounced in regions where increasing numbers of people are living in and around large forests, including the Far West, the Northeast and some Rocky Mountain states. Oregon appears to have had the sharpest reversal of fortune. After nearly 40 years of decline, the number of staffed fire lookouts in the state increased about 10 percent in the past decade, to more than 100, said Ray Kresek, author of ''Fire Lookouts of the Northwest,'' a book that chronicles the fate of all 3,133 lookouts in the region. Thanks to increased federal spending on fire prevention in Oregon, the number of fire lookouts on Forest Service land increased nearly 30 percent in the past year, to 66 from 51, a Forest Service spokesman in Portland said. ''There are so many people moving from the cities to rural wooded areas in Oregon,'' Mr. Kresek said. ''Both the Forest Service and the state realized that fire detection by aircraft wasn't really cutting it. The reports were not early enough and they resulted in larger fires.'' The urbanizing forests of Southern California are typical of the long fall and recent rise of the fire lookout. There, as in many of the reborn lookouts across the country, the work is done by volunteers. Many of them spend long days in towers where they can see their own neighborhoods. ''I got started in a tower where I could see my cabin,'' said George Morey, 63, who installs windows and screens in new houses. ''I think we have proven that we can do a better job of protecting our home than satellites or airplanes.'' Mr. Morey volunteered in the San Bernardino National Forest. Located about 60 miles east of Los Angeles, it is one of the country's most heavily populated national forests. Because of the hot summer winds that rake across a ridge of mountains, the forest is also a major fire risk. Starting this weekend and running until the first snows of late fall, that risk will be monitored by 260 volunteers who staff seven lookouts inside the forest. The volunteer program has also spread to two lookouts in the nearby Angeles National Forest. For many years, human eyes were not all that useful in Southern California lookout towers. They could not distinguish forest-fire smoke from the pall of smog that drifted west from Los Angeles. In the past decade, though, stricter rules on automobile emissions have significantly cleared the air. ''Now that we can see better from the towers, we can do a much better job of spotting fires,'' said Angie Moebius, a coordinator for the San Bernardino National Forest Association, a nonprofit group that manages the fire lookouts. The lookout program began in the early 1990's, she said, as a way of restoring abandoned towers and teaching Californians to appreciate the ecology of the forest. As the years went by, however, lookouts often spotted fires before air surveillance planes. ''Now we are up in the towers primarily for fire detection,'' Ms. Moebius said. In parts of the Northeast, staffed towers are making a comeback, as forests and suburbs meet. ''We have the most problems with fire in what we call the wild land-urban interface,'' said Bob Wolff, a fire warden in northern New Jersey for the state Forest Fire Service. ''People love having pine limbs brush up against their house, which is a beautiful thing -- until that forest catches on fire.'' New Jersey, where about 2,000 forest fires burn nearly 10,000 acres every year, is one of a few states that never turned away from fire lookouts. It has 21 towers, which afford lookouts a view of every major forest in the entire state. They are staffed throughout the fire season with full-time state employees. Because of drought in New Jersey over the past year, Mr. Wolff said, the fire season extended throughout the winter. Leaving fire spotting primarily to aircraft has always been a bad idea, said Mr. Kresek, who lives in Spokane, Wash. ''There is no comparison between a good lookout and an airplane,'' he said. ''A good lookout will see smoke at dawn, long before people who live next to a fire.'' The comeback of fire towers, especially in Oregon and California, has been gratifying, said Mr. Kresek, a retired firefighter. But he describes himself as ''extremely disappointed'' in the State of Washington for continuing to take lookouts out of service. ''I expect Washington to be putting lookouts back up once they get them all torn down,'' he said. As this summer begins, the Washington State Department of Natural Resources plans to have only one full-time staffed lookout in the state, he said. Located in the Colville Forest about seven miles south of the Canadian border, it is where Gayle Kaste continues to do what she has been doing for a quarter-century. ''I don't read books up here,'' she said, prowling the catwalk that surrounds the glassed-in cabin of her 40-foot lookout. ''I read magazines. That way I can look around every 10 minutes.'' Jim Updike works as a warden down in the forest that Mrs. Kaste guards from her mountaintop perch. By spotting fires early and directing firefighters to the precise location where they are burning, he said, she certainly earned her keep. She makes about $1,700 a summer. ''We are really lucky to have her watching over us,'' he said."
"Rain and snow, rare visitors to drought-stricken Colorado, tamed a scorching wildfire today in the Pike National Forest, but did little to quell apprehension about the effects of severe drought here and in many parts of the West this summer. ''Something like this helps, but it's a drop in the bucket,'' said Makoto Moore, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service who was assigned to the team managing the firefighting here in the depths of the million-acre forest. ''We need a prolonged period of cool and wet weather.'' If the past few months are any indication, such relief does not seem likely soon. What little snow there was on the state's many mountain peaks melted this winter two months ahead of schedule, leaving reservoirs and waterways -- including the Colorado River -- at depths far lower than usual. Coupled with an almost total lack of rain, the shortfall has forced cities, counties and communities to restrict water use, worried whether their reserves will hold out. With water for irrigation at a premium, ranchers have begun to auction off livestock to owners of more bountiful pasturelands elsewhere. Recreational fishing, a bastion of Colorado's economy, is headed for a severe downturn as aquatic habitats become gradually sparser. At least 35 of Colorado's 64 counties have issued outdoor fire bans, in what may be the state's worst drought in 60 years. Elsewhere, the situation is no better. Wyoming, California, Utah and Montana, as well as Colorado, need more than seven inches of rain to end the drought, experts estimate. The lack of rain has drastically affected wheat-growing areas of Kansas and Nebraska, and there is none in the forecast. Dust storms that caused the deaths of two motorists in Lincoln, Neb., on Wednesday prompted officials there to advise drivers to stay off highways on windy days. On Thursday, livestock farmers urged the Senate Agriculture Committee to provide $500 million in disaster assistance to drought-stricken areas. In New Mexico, a forest fire that has burned more than 4,000 acres in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains north of Santa Fe continued to rage today. Major fires have also hit Arizona. ''The effects of the drought have been more drastic than I originally thought,'' said Ned Williams, utilities director for Boulder. Its City Council on Tuesday ordered, among other things, that lawns be watered no more than twice a week, and no more than 15 minutes in one spot. Violators face fines or jail. One of the city's public pools will remain closed for the summer. ''The drought is real and the quantity of our water supply is fixed and limited, and has never been at this low a level,'' Mr. Williams told the council. In Lafayette, 10 miles east of Boulder, residents may not use a hose to wash cars, and pools may be filled only with the city's permission. In the 31 parks of the Denver Mountain Parks system, officials have banned everything that produces an open flame, like smoking, campfires, fireworks and welding torches. In Denver itself, officials have recommended limits on water use but have not made them mandatory. It is in the threat of fires that the drought reveals its greatest impact. Even as the Pike forest fire here, 60 miles southwest of Denver, weakened this morning, two new wildfires sprang to life west of Colorado Springs -- one of them caused by a power line felled by snow and wind. ''The moisture that we've gotten hasn't been around long enough to relieve the fire danger,'' said Richard Homann, fire division supervisor for the Colorado Forest Service. ''We're seeing much more fire activity than in previous years. It's even ahead of the 2000 fire season, which was bad throughout the West. If we keep on the same pace, it will be one of the top five fire seasons in Colorado.'' Colorado's fire season, which usually begins in mid-June, sprang to life on April 23, when the so-called Snaking Fire burned 3,000 acres northwest of Bailey. On May 5, the Black Mountain Fire near Evergreen forced the evacuation of 1,700 homes. This week, two major fires erupted near Nucla and Durango. Even the relatively dense rainfall here overnight -- and snowfall at higher elevations -- failed to satisfy fire officials, who ordered more than 600 firefighters from a half-dozen states back to work this morning on the steep slopes of the Pike Forest. The fire, which officials said they believed was sparked by lightning, flared up on Tuesday near Schoonover Gulch and within hours forced the evacuation of at least 60 people, including a group of youngsters at a Y.M.C.A. camp at which several buildings were later destroyed. Altogether, about a dozen structures burned by Thursday afternoon, when the fire had cut across some 4,000 acres. The flames came to within one-third of a mile of Deckers, an unincorporated town made up of a handful of buildings surrounded by Ponderosa pines, Douglas firs and juniper trees. In the wake of the fire, whole hills lay in a ghostly gray haze, the ground and the trees stripped of color and life. Along Highway 67, closed to normal traffic, the Horse Creek Cafe and Saloon survived, unlike the hills beyond it. On a dirt road leading to the Y.M.C.A. camp, all that remained of two burned vacation houses were their chimneys. At the camp, Shady Brook Ranch, a garage and two cabins were obliterated. Nearby, a crew of firefighters marched toward the hills, while a tanker truck pumped water from a pond where the children's canoes bobbed by a dock. ''It was pretty touch-and-go there for a while,'' said Bill Krausser, a contractor whose property at Trail Creek, 15 miles south of Deckers, was within sight of the fire on Wednesday night. Mr. Krausser said he got his two horses ready for loading into a trailer, and waited for the worst. As he watched, a black bear came thundering through the property, southbound. ''He was beating feet, heading away from the fire,'' Mr. Krausser recalled. ''Animals are smarter than people, sometimes.''"
"FIREFIGHTERS, particularly those who take on forest fires, are longtime users of Geographic Information Systems programs that marry database information with digital maps. So it was not a tremendous leap two years ago when several agencies with responsibilities related to forest fires got together to consolidate their GIS data and make it available to each other through the Internet. What they did not anticipate, however, was that a Web site conceived as a professional tool would become even more popular with the public. ''The intent was to make it for firefighting planners,'' said Liz Lile, a cartographer and the United States Geological Survey's project coordinator for the Web site. ''But it quickly became evident back then that the public was going to use it as well.'' That has especially been the case in recent weeks as forest fires have swept through large areas of Arizona and Colorado. The Web site, www.geomac.gov, logged 4.3 million requests for page views last month. Jeff Baranyi, an adviser to the project from ESRI, a maker of GIS software, said that the overwhelming majority of visitors used domain names associated with consumer Internet service providers. ''It's very much a public Internet site,'' he said. Unlike the professionals, such visitors were not concerned with issues like how to deploy firefighting equipment. Ms. Lile and Mr. Baranyi said that e-mail messages to the site indicated that people were instead using it as a tool to determine whether their homes or those of relatives were in the path of a spreading blaze. ''What they really want to know is, 'Where am I in relation to a fire and am I in danger?' '' Mr. Baranyi said. The dense smoke from forest fires prevents the site from displaying satellite images of individual houses in or near fire zones. What it does offer users are maps displaying the boundaries of all major fires that are active in the continental states and Alaska. The boundary maps are created, for the most part, by observers who fly around the perimeters of blazes. Online visitors can overlay simple road maps and insert a relief map background. In theory, it is possible to zoom in on very small areas on the maps. But Ms. Lile, whose agency hosts the Web site, said that the accuracy of the maps declined once a certain zoom level was passed. By design, the background relief map turns into a pattern of blocky pixels when users try to push the system beyond its limits. Because the system combines data from several agencies -- in addition to the Geological Survey, the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service and the Forest Service -- and was designed for use by people without access to GIS software, its maps are always somewhat behind the times. The GIS data is gathered at regular intervals -- in some cases every hour -- and transferred to a large database operated by the Geological Survey. Web server software then responds to requests from visitors and, using the database, generates the maps. The system's next feature may be one solely designed for visitors who are not experts. Ms. Lile said it should be technically feasible to introduce a variation on the online map services offered by companies like MapQuest. Users could type in their addresses and see a map indicating their proximity and vulnerability to the nearest forest fire. Such a feature would be popular, Mr. Baranyi said. ''Already we've had people sitting in high school gymnasiums trying to figure if their house has burned or not.''"
"A woman was arrested today after law enforcement officials concluded that she was the person who announced in a convenience store on Sunday that she had just set a wildfire that threatens some of the world's oldest trees. ''It's taken them three days to find her,'' said Jim Paxon, a spokesman for the Forest Service's incident command team that is in charge of battling the fire. The blaze, called the McNalley fire, grew to more than 85 square miles today and was within striking distance of at least two groves of giant sequoias near Johnsondale, a hamlet on the western flank of the fire. It was also expanding to the north, east and south and was just 5 percent contained. ''The people in the store were kind of shell shocked,'' Mr. Paxon said in an interview, recalling the reaction to the woman's confession. ''A lady walked in, said she'd had a fight with her boyfriend and that she'd started a fire -- and walked out.'' The woman, whose name has not been released, was being held in Bakersfield, and it was expected that she would be transferred to Fresno on Thursday. More than 1,500 firefighters, aided by 11 helicopters, 7 air tankers and about 20 bulldozers, continued to battle the flames, which swept across parched forested hillsides this afternoon within sight of Johnsondale, which lies at 4,720 feet in the southern, mountainous reaches of the Sequoia National Forest. The two sequoia groves most threatened, known as Packsaddle and Cunningham, both filled with towering trees hundreds of years old, were safe for the time being this afternoon, but fire officials emphasized that everything depended on the vagaries of the wind, and the good fortune of the firefighters. ''This fire is still expanding in all four directions,'' Mr. Paxon said at the command center in Kernville, 27 miles south of here. ''You really have to see what Mother Nature does.'' Still, Mr. Paxon, who gained a certain fame with television audiences during the Rodeo-Chediski fire last month in Arizona for his careful, somewhat folksy explanations of the science of fighting fires, said he was encouraged that the McNalley fire's rate of expansion seemed to have slowed. The fire began on Sunday afternoon in a camping area by the Kern River and quickly plowed through the nearby Road's End Lodge and three houses. ''Within 45 minutes it was in Johnsondale, five miles away,'' said Danny Randall, a Bureau of Land Management employee who was assigned to the McNalley command team from his post at Tent Rocks National Monument in New Mexico. At least three of the most devastating fires so far this year -- the Hayman blaze in Colorado, the Rodeo-Chediski fire in Arizona and this one -- were apparently started by humans and not by lightning or other natural causes. The person charged with starting the Colorado fire worked in fire prevention for the Forest Service. Officials said the Rodeo fire was set by an out-of-work firefighter who wanted to insure that he got a jobs, and the Chediski fire, with later merged with the Rodeo one, was sparked by a lost hiker trying to get the attention of a helicopter pilot. Here in California, an escorted drive through the fire area showed now-customary scenes of abandoned towns, trailers and houses, and ash-filled moonscape hillsides that had once been filled with verdant, if dry, brush and swaying trees. Rounding a curve in the road from Kernville, a wall of fire was clearly visible on a ridge. It moved swiftly up the hillside in the 95-degree afternoon, scorching the brush, pines and firs it touched. A little farther, thick columns of smoke poured from vegetation on a steep mountainside and spiraled into the sky. The danger of more fire continued. ''There's a monsoonal influence that's bringing the possibility of thunderstorms, which could bring dry lightning,'' said Karen Guillemin, a fire prevention specialist with the California Department of Forestry. The fire, fueled by wind blowing through the Kern River Canyon, could still move around, catching firefighters unaware, Ms. Guillemin said. ''The wind always blows up the canyon during the day, and at night in the other direction,'' she said. ''With a thunder cell over it, it could be very dangerous.'' Here in Johnsondale, a handful of employees of a lakeside resort were permitted to return today, three days after their evacuation, to make sure the place was safe and sound. It was. ''I pretty much grabbed what I could and high-tailed it out,'' said Michael Stefan, 21, a security guard who has lived in a trailer for one and a half years. ''The fire missed my trailer by about 60 feet.''"
"When the heat broke late last week in the Northeast, it did so with a stiff wind out of the north. At first, pure white clouds brushed across a deep blue sky, the very epitome of summer's fair weather. But as the hours passed, that same southward current of air began to carry with it the smoke from dozens of lightning-started forest fires in northern Quebec, a part of Canada that has recently suffered extremely high temperatures. By the weekend, much of the Northeast was living in the sepia light of a smoke-dimmed sun. It took some getting used to, that shorn sun. Its heat remained, but without the blinding light. The difference between full sun and full shade became mostly a matter of temperature rather than light intensity. Sunset was like watching a somehow demoted star, stripped of its brilliance, reduced to a perfect red disk riding low in the sky. That disk seemed preposterously near, and yet it demonstrated how huge a region of the sky the summer sun dominates on a cloudless, smokeless day. This was the strange light of a partial eclipse, but stranger still because it hung on so long and because it carried, in many places, the scent of wood smoke from some 800 miles away. This was just a taste of what much of the American West is living with this summer, a summer of acrid brown skies and a diluted sun. By yesterday the Quebec plume had drifted away from the major metropolitan areas of the Northeast, though it could well return if the wind shifts again. But much of the West is going to be living under a pall like this for most of the rest of the summer. This smoke was a novelty to most of us, and not even an unpleasing one at that. That's partly because it blew down from so far away, from a place most of us haven't seen and can't easily imagine. In the West, however, the smoke blows in from the next state, the next county, sometimes even the next ridge. There is no forgetting, for an instant, what it means."
"The fires that continued to roar today near hundreds of giant sequoias, the towering trademarks of the area around this central California town, have renewed an argument over how best to manage the Sequoia National Forest's resources while preventing the woodland's destruction. Mirrored in similar cases across the country but particularly acute in the vast forests of the West, the debate pits the competing interests of preservation and business against each other and leads to drawn swords every time a fire makes ash of the landscape. ''You know who's getting all the blame for this?'' asked David Priest, who runs a bait-and-tackle shop in Lake Isabella, a town 10 miles south of here that has been afflicted by three wildfires in the two months. ''Clinton,'' he replied to his own question, referring to the former president. Mr. Clinton established the Giant Sequoia National Monument during his last year in office, protecting a 328,000-acre piece of the forest from culling, logging and most clearing that involves heavy equipment. Many people here say that protection has added fuel to the fires. ''If you can't go in there and bulldoze, how do you clean things out so that they don't explode?'' said Linda Meadors, a bank employee who has lived in Kernville for 27 years and said she used to enjoy hunting deer and game birds like quail and pheasant in the area of the monument, activities banned under the new designation. ''It doesn't make sense that you can't fight fire because of laws and special interest groups. There's a lot of resentment here over that.'' Regardless, the latest fire, which began on Sunday when a campfire ran out of control near a lodge on the Kern River named McNally's, was being fought today on all fronts. A Bakersfield woman, Peri Van Brunt, 45, was arrested on Wednesday in connection with the fire, although officials said they did not believe she had set it deliberately. Fire officials seemed hopeful that they could have some measure of control over the blaze in two or three days if favorable wind and weather conditions persisted. But if the winds shift and blow the 58,500-acre fire more intensely toward the sequoia groves to the west and north, firefighters would have a hard time stopping it from entering the Trail of 100 Giants, the most spectacular of the old sequoia groves, where trees 2,000 years old stand 200 feet tall. In all, 11 sequoia groves were threatened by the McNally fire today, with at least one less than a mile from the flames. Many of the trees in the area have survived countless fires in the past, but the brush around many of them is unusually thick and could flare up to unmanageable levels, fire officials said. ''In some of this country, it's been 100 years since we had fire in it,'' Jim Paxon, a Forest Service spokesman, said this morning. ''But things are looking up. As long as we don't get a major burst of thunderstorms with downdrafts, we'll be in good shape.'' Sean Cosgrove, a forest policy specialist with The Sierra Club, said that because the Forest Service generates revenue from timber sales, the economic incentive to promote logging might interfere with the agency's mandate to protect wildlife and old-growth trees. ''We don't sue or litigate to stop controlled burns,'' Mr. Cosgrove said. ''We sue over fire reduction projects that are packaged as bad timber sale projects.'' Loggers say that the battle by environmentalist groups to ban old-growth timber cuts have curtailed the tree-thinning needed to prevent large fires. ''These fires are due to the reductions in logging,'' said Glen Duysen, founder of Sierra Forest Products, a 35-year-old timber company in Terra Bella, eight miles from here, that runs just one of the eight mills it once had. ''There are just too many trees per acre.'' But Art Gaffrey, a Forest Service supervisor here, said that each year 6,000 to 8,000 acres of the Sequoia Forest are thinned using prescribed burns and timber cuts. ''Proposed projects have been questioned and there have been delays and changes,'' Mr. Gaffrey said. ''But in my seven years here I do not remember a project being stopped.'' Forestry officials acknowledge that overly aggressive fire-suppression policies in place since early last century have left forests vulnerable to much larger fires because the natural order, which counts on fires to clear land and promote new growth, has been upset. ''Smokey Bear did too good a job,'' said Matt Mathes, a Forest Service spokesman. ''It was a well-meaning policy with unintentional consequences.''"
"About 45 forest fires burning simultaneously in northern Quebec, fanned from winds out of the north, have spread a milky haze across New England and New York State, meteorologists said yesterday. Satellite tracking showed clouds of smoke stretching even as far south as Washington, said John Quinlan, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Albany, N.Y. ''Many people have actually begun to smell the smoke in faraway places, indicating that the particles are getting thicker,'' Mr. Quinlan said. Health officials have advised people with respiratory problems or cardiovascular disease to stay inside with their windows closed and suggested that everyone curtail strenuous outdoor exercise. The haze could clear as early as today, Mr. Quinlan said, as winds begin to shift to the south and southwest, carrying the smoke far off the Eastern Seaboard. The fires, most of which started Tuesday during a lightning storm, have consumed more than 100,000 acres of forest around James Bay, said Charlotte Leger, a spokeswoman for Sopfeu, a fire protection agency in Quebec. About 10 of the fires, about 500 miles north of Montreal, continued to burn out of control yesterday, she said. One blaze forced the evacuation last week of Nemaska, a village of 500 Cree Indians, Ms. Leger said, and power was briefly cut to 500,000 customers on Friday when another fire threatened electric transmission lines. No one has been seriously injured in the fires. The winds first shifted on Friday, Mr. Quinlan said, pushing the smoke across the northeastern United States. The smoke caused spotty delays in commercial airline traffic in the Northeast as air traffic controllers extended the spacing between planes on takeoff and landing. Jeff Awalt, a spokesman for Continental Airlines, said its flights were delayed up to 20 minutes at the airports in Baltimore, Washington and Newark. ''Flights have been spaced out a little more due to reduced visibility, causing some additional holding times,'' Mr. Awalt said. But he said that there was ''no significant impact on operations'' and that 93 percent of Continental flights in the Northeast were on time yesterday, a percentage slightly worse than on a normal Sunday."
"While favorable conditions appear to have slowed the mammoth blaze in California's Sequoia National Forest that has been threatening some of the world's biggest and oldest trees, there has been no stopping efforts by the timber industry and opportunistic politicians to exploit Western wildfires for commercial and ideological gain. The latest and most cynical manifestation of this impulse is a proposal by several Republican senators from Western states to suspend basic environmental laws in order to accelerate logging on up to 24 million acres of national forest land. The senators describe this as necessary to prevent further fires. Conservationists, quite rightly, see the proposal as an excuse to engage in widespread commercial harvesting in remote areas where wildfires pose no threat to people or property but where the opportunities for profit are substantial. Two years ago, in what amounted to a summit meeting on forest fires, the Clinton administration and six Western governors agreed on a fresh approach to firefighting. The strategy consisted of controlled burns -- that is, fires deliberately set to prevent even larger blazes -- plus an aggressive program of ''thinning.'' Thinning, it was generally agreed, meant removing underbrush and small-diameter trees near at-risk populated areas. The biggest and most fire-resistant trees would be spared, as would more remote areas of the national forests. The governors held another conference last year, attended by both environmentalists and Bush administration officials, that ratified exactly the same strategy. Nevertheless, the timber industry and its Congressional retainers continue to argue that to be effective, the policy must also embrace ''thinning'' of big, commercially valuable trees in remote areas. That of course is nonsense. No fire strategy in the world can protect all parts of the national forest. Indeed, fires are an inevitable and healthy part of the natural cycle. But thinning overgrown, fuel-laden forests around inhabited areas is well within government's reach. And the environmentalists have made it clear that they have no objections to such a strategy. Maybe what's needed now is another meeting, at which all sides would agree to stop the political maneuvering and get on with a sensible, well-targeted firefighting program. Given what appears to be an unyielding drought throughout much of the West, this could be the worst fire season in decades. It is no time for posturing."
"With conditions relentlessly dry and the weather growing hotter, firefighters today battled 34 significant fires in eight Western states, the most dramatic of which creeped menacingly toward the giant, centuries-old trees of Sequoia National Forest. Across the nation, about 350 new wildfires were reported on Monday, although only four of those escaped initial attacks by firefighters to become larger fires. ''The West is really where we're seeing the most of the large fire activity,'' said Janelle Smith, a spokeswoman for the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, which is tracking 14 fires in Oregon alone. In Kernville, Calif., about 150 miles north of here, an out-of-control blaze threatened the Sequoia National Forest, where the largest redwood trees in existence have, for the most part, survived countless fires over the years. About 1,000 firefighters have been summoned to the blaze officials are calling the McNalley Fire, which has burned almost 38,000 acres of wildland and smaller trees. If uncontained, the blaze could be headed for about 200 structures in and near the forest. Winds today began blowing the flames away from the Trail of a Hundred Giants, where the tallest and oldest trees stand about two miles from the front of the fire, officials said. The blaze was only 20 percent contained and remained highly unpredictable. The Trail of a Hundred Giants was not in immediate danger, a spokeswoman said. A spokesman for the United States Forest Service, Jim Paxon, said that anything could happen with conditions so volatile. ''If fire does get in the Trail of a Hundred Giants, we won't be putting firefighters in there to try to stop it,'' The Associated Press reported Mr. Paxon as saying. ''It will be a climax of 300- or 400-foot flames.'' Firefighters were carefully watching the fire's proximity to the forest's Packsaddle and Freeman Creek groves, where some underbrush had been removed before the current blaze. ''Fire is going to go through those other groves if it gets there,'' Mr. Paxon said, ''but because they've had some treatment, the fire may be on the ground and not destroy those groves.'' About 400 Boy Scouts were evacuated from a camp near the forest, as were several hundred people in nearby towns. At least 10 structures in the area were destroyed. In south-central Oregon, the 34,400-acre Winter Fire joined in one area with the 63,012 Tool Box Fire, and each was about 40 percent contained today, said Chris Friend, a spokesman for the Oregon Department of Forestry. The Winter Fire ''is still giving us fits now and then,'' said Mr. Friend, who described how a team of firefighters were moved out of an area of dead and highly flammable trees on Monday when a downdraught from a thunderstorm ''scattered the wind in all directions.'' The Monument Fire in Oregon grew today to 24,700 acres, and was threatening about 75 homes, Ms. Smith said. The blaze, near Unity, a small town in northeast Oregon, was nowhere near containment, she said. Also in Oregon, the Eyerly Fire was being managed under one command, near Camp Sherman. The resulting 23,777-acre fire was 75 percent contained today. In Idaho and Utah, firefighters were chasing about 25 new fires. ''At this point, they're initial attacks -- in other words, the first response,'' Ms. Smith said. ''That's when they try to contain or put it out in the first attack. That's been our strategy. When things have been as extreme as they are, we try to catch those fires with initial attacks before they become large.'' This year, 3.7 million acres of wildland have burned in the United States; the average for the year to date is normally 1.7 million acres. ''Keep in mind that it's just been an extreme fire season, and we're only approaching the peak of season about now,'' Ms. Smith said. ''What really sets this year apart is that really extreme drought conditions existed in many states. The fire behavior that they were seeing was a month earlier than what they usually see.'' In Colorado, a light rain helped firefighters battling a 4,100-acre blaze near Rocky Mountain National Park. About 225 homes near Lyons, Colo., were evacuated and occupants of 400 to 500 more houses were told today to be ready to leave. Firefighters were concerned about predictions of wind and lightning today as they dug firebreaks around the Deer Point Fire, a 23,700-acre blaze near Lake Chelan, Wash. Evacuation warnings remained in effect for about 200 homes there and the fire was 30 percent contained."
"The fires came early this year to the West, chasing people out of valleys in Colorado, rousting animals from late slumber in Alaska, choking the sky with smoke in Arizona woods that have so little moisture they seem kiln-dried. The price of holding back nature has come home, fire officials say. A century-long policy of knocking down all fires has created fuel-filled forests that burn hotter and faster than ever. The era of big fires -- and with it, the need for big government to contain them -- is at hand, many firefighters say. Already, with 1.9 million acres burned by the first day of summer, wildfires across the West are burning twice the acreage of the 10-year average for this time of year. A convergence of events -- drier forests, higher temperatures, a yearslong drought and more people living in places where fire has long made a home -- is likely to keep armies of yellow-shirted firefighters busier than ever, at a cost to taxpayers of $2 billion a year. ''We've got the equivalent of the perfect storm,'' said Stephen J. Pyne, an Arizona State University fire historian who has written many books on the subject. Forest Service officials say 73 million acres, about 40 percent of all Forest Service land, are at risk of severe fires in coming years. Since four firefighters choked to death on superheated gas in this Eastern Washington valley last year, government strategy for fighting fires has changed, with new rules that will slow response in the woods. Smoke jumpers will not always be in Westerners' backyards at a moment's notice. ''Some citizens may resent any delay when they know there is a fire burning in the forest,'' said Sonny J. O'Neal, supervisor of the Okanogan and Wenatchee National Forests. In Arizona tonight, two major fires that have been burning all week were about to connect, and officials told residents of the area's largest town, Show Low, to evacuate. ''We're at the mercy of Mother Nature right now,'' said Larry Humphrey, incident commander of the Rodeo fire, Arizona's largest. ''There's not a whole lot we can do.'' Some say the fires are a harbinger. ''These catastrophic fire seasons are going to become the norm,'' said Bruce Babbitt, the former Interior secretary and Arizona governor. ''The question is, what are we going to do about it? Can we learn to live in the woods, when in most of these areas there aren't even building codes?'' One central question is whether the government should be more willing to start controlled fires, to burn off built-up fuels. But the policy is vexed, in part because some of the biggest recent fires were government-started blazes that got out of control -- and because growing numbers of people and homes are in harm's way if controlled burns jump the rails. The fires this time are also prompting calls to enact a new social contract. People living in fire zones would have to do preventive maintenance to expect government help when the woods catch fire. The insurance industry, which has forced a change among home developers by making it more costly to live in flood zones, is considering similar rules for fire areas. In Alaska, where a half-million acres have burned this year and the fire season came earlier than anyone can remember, insurers have already stopped offering policies to homeowners who refuse to remove fire hazards from their houses in areas where dead spruce trees are likely to burn. But changing fire policy is slow, subject to partisan fluctuations and interest-group pressure and fraught with technical questions. ''Reinstating fire is like reinstating a lost species,'' Dr. Pyne said. Republicans blame environmentalists, arguing that stepped-up logging is the answer, to clear the forests of the trees most likely to burn. Democrats argue that the timber industry is using fire as an excuse to cut down trees. The Bush administration has no plans to change fire policy, said Mark E. Rey, who oversees the Forest Service. It will try to reduce the ''process paralysis'' that has kept land agencies from taking big new steps to clear out fuel in the forests, he said, and to encourage people in fire zones to be aware of the constant threat. On the fire front lines in Colorado and Arizona, the message is starting to get through. But for many, it is too late. The Battleground On the Front Lines, The Urban Interface After deciding to leave Las Vegas, Nancy and Steve Smith looked at nearly 40 houses before finding the 3,200-square-foot home they bought last March in the Colorado Rockies. ''We knew this was the house we had been looking for,'' Mrs. Smith said. ''It was on top of a wooded ridge overlooking a valley with horse ranches. To the west we had beautiful views of Thunder Butte. Our property bordered Pike National Forest on one side.'' They came to the mountains, like most urban exiles, seeking clean air, solitude, a closeness to nature. ''I had no idea until mid-April that we were in an area that was considered high risk for fire,'' Mrs. Smith said. ''When we moved in, there was snow on the ground. And it snowed every week for a month.'' On May 19, barely a few weeks after that last snow, the Smith family was told to evacuate because of a growing wildfire. Then came the Hayman wildfire, Colorado's biggest blaze, which the authorities say was started by a seasonal Forest Service worker. In days, the fire covered 20 miles, spreading to within five miles of the Smiths' house. Last Monday, the Smiths had two hours to retrieve more possessions. On Wednesday, their dream house was destroyed. Whether the fire was natural or not will be debated for years. But the Smiths' story is more common across the West as more people move into what used to be wilderness. Experts call the zone where homes meet forest the ''urban-wildland interface.'' That is where most fires are being fought. Ten times as many homes are now in areas prone to wildfire as there were 25 years ago, said Don Smurthwaite, a spokesman for the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. In Colorado, the number of people living in areas at risk of fire increased 30 percent during the 1990's, said James E. Hubbard, the state forester. Nearly a million people in Colorado now live in the fire zone, state and federal demographers said. Demography and nature collided in Colorado this spring when wildfires broke out in the Rockies, where a drought meant there was little snowpack to provide moisture. ''Usually, the fires don't start until June in this part of the world,'' said Gordon Koenig, a pilot who has been dumping fire retardant on Colorado six days a week since April. Mr. Koenig said the season had doubled in length in the 13 years he has been fighting fires. A half-century ago, the strategy of fighting nearly every fire was easier. But the era when smoke jumpers would drop into uninhabited valleys is gone, Forest Service officials say. Its end is complicated because the new generation of Westerners has not learned how to live in the red zone safely. ''While Westerners are getting more educated about fire, there is still a kind of dangerous independence, one that resists all zoning and regulation, that exists among people who live in the fire zone,'' said Pat Williams, a former Montana congressman. Others agree. ''I think the public has accepted the fact that fire has a natural place,'' said Dr. Pyne, the Arizona State fire historian. ''People are starting to get it. But it will take another 10 years or so to work out. Unfortunately, that means the peak of wildfires and homes destroyed will be in the next five years.'' The Policy When to Fight And What to Risk Smokey Bear came of age in an era that was haunted by a single summer, 1910, a year that still hangs over all Forest Service decisions about fire. In that year, it seemed as if all of the West was on fire. Three million acres burned in Montana and Idaho alone, and 87 people died. ''Thousands of people thought the world was coming to an end,'' wrote Norman Maclean, the author of ''Young Men and Fire,'' a story of one of the worst calamities in firefighting history. The deaths, and the apocalyptic images of valleys where daylight had turned to darkness, prompted the fledgling group of government foresters to adopt a new policy. From then on, every fire would be fought, quickly. But even by midcentury, some foresters were beginning to argue that the policy was misguided and that by snuffing out all fires, the Forest Service was only delaying the inevitable big fires. A 1999 report by the General Accounting Office blamed a century of putting out all fires for ''an increasing number of large, intense, uncontrollable and catastrophically destructive wildfires.'' The agency said forests in the West would be at risk of big fires through 2015. The government has made various attempts to change its policy. One of its most notable experiments was in 1988, when some natural fires that consumed more than half of Yellowstone National Park were allowed to burn. Though the policy angered some Western senators at the time, the now-green park seems to vindicate the National Park Service's decision. But the issue of allowing fires to burn becomes infinitely more complex when the fire is raging not in a park or a wilderness but near a neighborhood. ''People will simply not tolerate that,'' Mr. Babbitt said. The government's ability to make the case for controlled burns has also been severely hampered by its own missteps. In 2000, for example, a fire started by the Park Service in New Mexico raged out of control and destroyed hundreds of houses and thousands of acres, ultimately costing the government far more than it ever would have paid to fight a natural fire in the area. Fires become politicized, too. In 1988, some people blamed the Reagan administration for letting Yellowstone burn. In 2000, George W. Bush implied that President Bill Clinton's policies were to blame for Montana fires. ''The only thing that burns hotter than a wildfire in the West is the demagoguery of some politicians trying to take advantage of it,'' said Mr. Williams, the former Montana congressman. The Clinton and Bush administrations have pushed for some logging of dead or dying forests in particularly vulnerable areas, but have been stymied by lawsuits and protests from environmental groups. Last week, in testimony before Congress, Dale Bosworth, the chief of the Forest Service, said ''analysis paralysis'' from lawsuits and second-guessing by the land agencies had prevented the government from burning or logging some fire-prone areas. But even in areas that have been logged, laced with roads or cleaned of excess brush, firestorms have raced through. In 2000, when eight million acres burned, fires scorched the Bitterroot Valley in Montana, taking out ancient trees on one side of the mountains and homes and orchards on the other. The other policy debate centers on firefighters and how much risk they should take to save property. When the Mann Gulch fire killed 12 young men in 1949, the Forest Service vowed to never repeat its mistakes. But in 1994 in Colorado, 14 firefighters died in the South Canyon fire. The circumstances were hauntingly similar, except this time they were fighting to save houses in the urban interface. The Forest Service partly blamed gung-ho firefighters for the deaths. Last year, after Congress met the call for more firefighters in response to the huge fires of 2000, four people died in the Thirty Mile Fire in the valley just north of here, trapped in fire shelters after a flame storm overwhelmed them. An investigation said numerous safety rules had been violated. Some people also blamed the rush to throw firefighters, some poorly trained, at fires. All these deaths have had a humbling effect on the men and women who fight fires. As Mr. O'Neal, the forest supervisor, said in announcing new guidelines this week, firefighters are not going to die to save property. ''We will continue to attack and control fires that threaten life, property or important natural resources,'' Mr. O'Neal said. ''But in every case, safety comes first.'' The Science Calculating Danger And Predicting Relief No matter how many loads of retardant are dumped and fire lines cut, the threat to the Rockies will be eased only by moisture -- in amounts vastly greater than can be carried in the bellies of airplanes. The prime ingredients for conflagration remain abundant across much of the West, fire experts say: dry weather, frequent winds, sunken water tables and desiccated, fuel-laden stands of trees and brush, which one New Mexico wilderness expert called ''dog-hair forest'' because they are so overgrown. As a result, when there is a source of ignition, whether a burning letter or a lightning strike, fires spring up explosively. The Hayman fire and the Missionary Ridge fire near Durango were so broad and fierce last week that gusts of oven-hot air rising at superhighway speeds spawned thunderstorms and ''fire whirls,'' short-lived little cousins of tornados generated by clashing hot and cool air. ''A fire whirl can sustain itself and hop right over fire lines,'' said Larry Van Bussum, the staff meteorologist at the National Interagency Fire Center. ''They're carrying fire and debris and embers and are throwing them all over the place. You start seeing those on the fire line and you know things are getting pretty ugly.'' In the mountains east of Santa Fe, N.M., one fire that burned 2,000 acres by Wednesday had tripled in size by Friday morning and was advancing at its peak through a mile of forest an hour, officials said. Salvation, in the form of great pools of moist air, sits hundreds of miles away, over the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico. That air, heavy with water vapor, will be drawn toward the country's scorched interior only when high pressure builds over Texas, as it does each summer, creating an atmospheric carousel. Federal meteorologists say that moist air flow should begin in a few more weeks. Satellites have already measured some wisps filtering over Mexico. That would bring some relief to the southern Rockies, but it would do nothing to help the Pacific Northwest, which usually goes into a drought every summer until October. Even after showers and downpours arrive in the Southwest, however, the fire threat will remain high, said John E. Jones Jr., deputy director of the National Weather Service. This is the case, Mr. Jones said, even though federal meteorologists predict above-normal rainfall for Colorado and eastern Utah this summer. Part of the problem, he said, is that temperatures across the West are expected to be higher than normal through September. Meanwhile, across broad stretches of the region where the worst drought in memory remains entrenched, farmers and homeowners kick at powdery soil and watch smoke rise. In Santa Fe, where the reservoir is little more than a damp bowl, the community is trying to adapt to the longstanding absence of water. At Plaza Resolana, a conference center there, managers have placed a bucket in each shower stall and asked guests to collect the first cold gush before the hot water kicks in. Guests tote the water into the gardens to keep a few favorite shrubs alive. A pile of smoke from a 6,000-acre fire just over the bristly ridge east of town settles at night, then rises again each morning as winds energize the flames. The Lessons A Community Learns To Live With Nature After a recent helicopter tour of wildfires across his state, Gov. Bill Owens declared, ''It looks as if all of Colorado is burning.'' He was exaggerating, of course. But the nine major wildfires crunching across Colorado made for an extraordinary start to a fire season. Wildfires have consumed almost 300,000 acres there, driving thousands of people from their homes. Like other Western states where dry conditions and dense underbrush are fueling blazes, Colorado is learning a hard lesson. It was a lesson residents of Malibu, Calif., learned in 1993, when a firestorm wiped out more than 350 homes. After the blaze, wholesale changes were made in building codes, and even in the rules governing landscaping, to reduce the spread of fire. The changes are among the most stringent in the country. Kathy and John Haag, who lost their house in 1993, have had to build their new home using an entirely different set of rules. ''I even had to move the footprint of the house on the lot and build a retaining wall in a hillside for the driveway to accommodate fire trucks,'' said Mr. Haag, a lawyer. The Haags can use only certain kinds of treated wood and fire-retardant materials, and they get constant reminders from the fire department to clear brush, or pay fines. It makes a difference. Though fire officials are expecting one of the worst fire seasons ever in Southern California because of a drought and a heavy accumulation of brush, they also say that the lessons of 1993 have helped to reduce the risks. P. Michael Freeman, the chief of the Los Angeles County Fire Department, said that a task force created after the 1993 fire eventually made 39 recommendations, virtually all of which have been put in place. ''The changes in the building code and our brush clearance I would characterize as almost radical,'' Chief Freeman said. Among the most important, he said, were vigilance on brush clearance and an emphasis on attacking fires quickly from the air. The Haags said they had just finished a two-year renovation of their home when the 1993 fire roared through. They escaped with only a few things thrown into the back of a car. Seeking to expand their home later, they ran into an array of tough new standards. They have to leave a five-foot space around the house clear for access. Grass has to be mowed to three inches or less, and ground cover, which can start 20 feet from the house, must be 18 inches or lower. Trees must be 30 feet apart. Eaves must be covered, with few ventilation openings, to prevent embers from lodging there in a fire. New houses must have sprinkler systems. Ann Stalcup, a schoolteacher, said she and her husband effectively replaced their wooden home, destroyed in the fire, with a stone house. The new roof is covered with terra cotta tiles, the wooden deck that juts out over the hillside is tiled in ceramic and the walls of the house are stucco. A sprinkler system has been installed, and, Ms. Stalcup said, she endures frequent visits from the fire department to ensure that the brush is cleared. Ken Chiate, a lawyer, lost two adjacent houses. One was rented to a family that still had the moving van out front when the fire came. Mr. Chiate rebuilt using the new materials and even had to include stronger walls, without windows. Asked why he stayed in a dangerous area, he said without hesitation: ''You get coyote wandering in the yard, roadrunners across your driveway, deer eating the roses. My wife feeds about a hundred quail. It's what we like, and we accept the risk.'' The Outlook Efforts to Change Yield Mixed Results It remains to be seen whether communities in Colorado and throughout the West, not all as rich as Malibu, will follow its example. Some experts are not optimistic. ''We call ourselves a nation of pragmatists,'' said Dr. Pyne, the fire historian, who spends much of the year living in the fire-prone woods near Alpine, Ariz. ''But you wouldn't know it by the way we deal with fire.'' So far, there is little talk of requiring people who live in areas vulnerable to fire to do much differently. Governor Owens of Colorado said in an interview that while state government could encourage people to take precautions against fire, changes in zoning laws and building codes are best left to local governments. But local efforts seem to have yielded mixed results. Under a national fire plan put in place at the end of the Clinton administration, counties in high-risk areas are required to develop fire plans. They are also supposed to issue rules for construction, seeing to it that roads are wide enough to accommodate firefighting equipment, that buildings are made of fire-resistant materials and that buildings are a fixed distance from trees. But meeting the requirements is daunting for many counties, and just 33 of Colorado's 64 counties have completed the task, said Larry Kallenberger, executive director of Colorado Counties Inc. Mr. Williams, the former congressman, said the federal government should have a role, using a carrot-and-stick approach to the millions of people moving into the fire zone. ''I think you ought to be able to build anywhere you want in these mountains, but don't expect taxpayer-financed firefighters to bail you out unless you take certain preventive steps,'' he said. Mr. Rey of the Forest Service said the Bush administration had no plans to require more fire prevention as a condition of government help. But he added, ''People need to develop a better understanding of the risks associated with building in these areas.'' That understanding includes acknowledging the costs. ''The question is when do you want to pay,'' said Roger A. Pielke Jr., a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder. ''You can pay through government disaster assistance and higher insurance premiums after the fact, or pay in advance through changing land-use and forest-management policies.'' But the latter option is not something an elected official will find very palatable, Professor Pielke said. ''Would you rather be looked at as a hero, bringing in aid after a disaster,'' he asked, ''or a bad guy who doesn't allow you to build in the way you want and place you want?'' The question no official -- in Colorado or elsewhere -- can answer is whether even a succession of devastating fire seasons is enough to persuade people to live differently. Mr. Hubbard, the Colorado forester, said big fires get people's attention -- but only for so long. ''After the flames have gone away and the fire season is only a memory, the sense of urgency wanes,'' he said. He added that good intentions were often overrun by Western individualism, which is especially common in people who choose to live in remote settings, apart from crowded subdivisions. ''You begin to see more resistance,'' Mr. Hubbard said. Some people, though, are having second thoughts. Patricia and Charles Thomas moved from the earthquake country of California into the fire zones of the Colorado Rockies, thinking they were safer in the mountains. Their development, called Tranquil Acres, has proved to be anything but. They have fled their house and are living hour by hour, waiting to see what happens as the Hayman fire bears down. ''It's a feeling in your gut like you're in war,'' Mrs. Thomas said. She would like to move back to California, but her husband prefers Colorado. ''We'll probably stay here and rebuild,'' she said. ''It's either that or I leave my husband.'' The Burning Season"
"When Terry Lynn Barton, wearing the uniform of a Forest Service seasonal employee, struck matches and started the Hayman fire, the largest in Colorado's history, she also struck a blow against everyone who fights wildland fire. Things were tough enough for wildland firefighters without the spectacle of someone charged as a Forest Service arsonist. The social compact under which the firefighters work and sometimes die is strained as never before. Firefighters are the nation's heroes, never more so than since Sept. 11. But not necessarily in fire country. Individual firefighters generally enjoy public goodwill along with their low pay. But fatal errors and mishaps, and a fundamental shift in objectives, have stretched the bond that unites the federal agencies that fight fire -- mainly the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management -- with those they protect. Today's wildland firefighters are being held to account as never before for how and when they fight fires, and for firefighter safety. The immediate cause of the problems is the need for more fire, not less, after nearly a century of ill-considered fire suppression. At the same time, people by the millions are moving into the red zones of the wildland-urban interface, the term for homes built in previously wild country. In Colorado, where Ms. Barton worked, a million more people are expected to move into rural areas by 2020. The same thing is happening from Florida to Washington. More fire plus more people guarantees conflict. The first big example drew a national audience when the National Park Service let the Yellowstone fire of 1988 burn unchecked. It has taken years for the realization to sink in that the jewel in the crown of the national park system was improved and not destroyed by that fire. Yellowstone came back green, as firefighters say. Quickly following was the debacle of the Cerro Grande fire in 2000, when a fire deliberately set to clear unwanted vegetation escaped control and destroyed over 200 homes in Los Alamos, N.M. The federal government footed the bill, an estimated $1 billion in property damage, and the prescribed fire program survived. The source of the trouble goes back nearly a century to the ''big blowup'' of 1910, the time the woods roared. No fire before or since has done as much to influence the way wildland fire is fought. Unexpected winds of near-hurricane strength struck the panhandle of Idaho and northwestern Montana in August of that year; three million acres burned and no fewer than 85 people were killed. From then on, the Forest Service determined to suppress fire on sight, giving rise to the famous ''10 a.m. policy,'' under which every fire was to be controlled the morning after it was sighted. The war was on, and everybody flocked to the same side. By midcentury, however, the death toll had risen to unacceptable levels. In 1957, the Forest Service convened a group of fire veterans to take lessons from the most deadly fires. They studied five major tragedy fires, each involving more than 10 deaths. The 1957 task force produced the 10 standard orders for fire safety in use today. The number of fire deaths dropped, but as the century drew to a close, history repeated itself. On July 6, 1994, 14 firefighters were killed in the South Canyon fire on Storm King Mountain in west-central Colorado. The fire was a mirror image of the Mann Gulch fire of 1949, which killed 13 smoke jumpers, one of the tragedy fires studied by the task force. The lessons of the past had been forgotten, with catastrophic consequences. The South Canyon fire was a wake-up call. Why engage in a heroic struggle with fire, as the firefighters on Storm King Mountain did, if not all fires were worth fighting? By 1994, many fires were being allowed to burn themselves out. Deliberate or prescribed burning was on the rise; the federal government today has a program to burn 20 million acres in the present decade to restore forest health. One of the biggest fires in Colorado this weekend is the Coal Seam fire, which is burning on and near the site of the South Canyon fire. The Coal Seam fire so far has destroyed 29 homes and 14 other structures, scorched more than 12,000 acres, six times the amount of the South Canyon fire, and cost more than $2.3 million. But no one has died fighting it. The lesson from the South Canyon fire being applied to the Coal Seam fire is to pull back when the going gets too hot. The ''yellow book,'' the pocket bible of firefighting, this year for the first time has a page titled ''How to Properly Refuse Risk,'' a direct consequence of the South Canyon fire. Storm King taught another lesson, that supervisors must be held more to account for firefighter safety. This month, a Forest Service report recommended disciplinary action for 11 Forest Service employees involved in the Thirty Mile fire, which killed four firefighters last summer in Washington. The recommended punishments, while late in coming, range from letters of reprimand to firing. If carried out, they will be unprecedented. Wildland firefighters have weathered the Yellowstone, Cerro Grande and South Canyon fires. They are a hardy breed. Tomorrow morning they will roll out and carry on, and just about every one will be a credit to the uniform. Firefighting: A Memo John N. Maclean is the author of ''Fire on the Mountain,'' the story of the fire on Storm King Mountain in Colorado that killed 14 firefighters in 1994."
"Crackling fire threatened another Arizona community today, drawing hundreds of firefighters who started an intense effort to save some 700 homes. The blaze, part of the huge Rodeo-Chediski fire, was on the verge of barreling through canyons south of Forest Lakes, an unincorporated area about 40 miles west of here. Firefighters were concerned that it might streak up a heavily wooded, 2,000-foot incline toward the plateau on which the town stands. The blaze jumped a fire line and was less than three miles from the town, which has been evacuated. ''We should say a prayer for the people of Forest Lakes,'' said Kate Klein, the United States Forest Service ranger in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests' Black Mesa district, in which the town lies. ''They certainly need God on their side.'' The fire has already destroyed about 270 buildings in the twin communities of Heber-Overgaard and still menaces that area, 20 miles west of Forest Lakes. ''If this fire gets away, we could be in a lot of trouble,'' said Mell Epps, fire chief in Heber-Overgaard, whose 3,500 residents were evacuated a week ago. Tim Grier, a spokesman for the Forest Service who lives in Forest Lakes, said, ''This may be the defining day.''"
"Everett Massey sold off five head of skinny cattle the other day and got a bad price. The man from the slaughterhouse knew what everyone knows around here. Cattlemen are desperate and that means they either accept a bad price or burn their dead animals. So Mr. Massey, a third-generation Apache rancher sold a $600 bull for $400 and the four dry cows for $75 a head. ''It's no good,'' said Mr. Massey, 45, a part-time Lutheran. ''I pray for rain every day.'' It seems that nearly everyone is praying for rain on this desiccated 1.6 million-acre reservation, 20 percent of which is in flames. But beyond the inferno over the Canyon Day range there is a silent, prolonged crisis, a strangling seven-year drought that has led to the siphoning off the aquifer, the blackening of the grazing grasses and the starving of animals to the point of hide, bone and sinew. Of all the dried-out West, no area has been harder hit than here in northern Arizona. Rain and snowfall have been a third of their normal levels, and though the rainy season is around the corner, few believe it will bring enough to matter. The traditional Apaches have been singing and dancing the ancient prayers since Saturday, when the fires grew out of control. And men like Mr. Massey, who turned their backs on those old ways, will willingly return to them if it means enough rain will fall. ''Grandma told me this river went dry in the 30's during the Dust Bowl days,'' Mr. Massey said as he stood ankle deep in the once-mighty White River that cuts through his ranch. The river has been reduced to a muddy creek and the water is so low, it is said that people at its headwaters are catching fish with their hands. ''It was a bad time for the people then,'' he said. ''A lot of Apache people left home and never came back. Home is one of those things that makes you Indian.'' The bad times have returned. The aquifer from which the Apaches pull their drinking water has only enough water to last four years. The drought can also be measured in other ways. The grasses are as dry as matchsticks and any good grass is being devoured by horses and deer that are coming out of the mountains because they, too, are starving. Mr. Massey, a large man with a good attitude about his crumbling fortunes, manages 250 head of cattle with the help of a man whom he pays $25 a day. He had others but had to lay them off since the slaughterhouse man has him over a barrel. ''I'm ashamed to say I pay him that little because a man cannot live on $150 a week,'' he said. ''But the truth is I'm not making anything.'' There are eight other cattle ranches in Apache territory and about 4,000 cattle. They share the communal grazing grounds, and there are still some green grasses in the mountains. But the expense of driving the cattle that high is prohibitive. ''It's hardly worth it anyway,'' Mr. Massey said. ''The mountains lions will eat your animals before you know it.'' The law of the market suggests that men like Mr. Massey should leave the business. But tradition many times trumps market considerations. His grandfather was a cattleman, as was his father, and he was taught the trade as a boy. It is not as though Mr. Massey has no other skills. He is an electrician at the lumber mill in White River, but the mill shut down after the forest caught fire. Mr. Massey said he was too old to re-enlist in the Marines or to take up rodeo again. It is enough to drive a man back to church on Sundays. ''Thing is, I don't got time for church,'' he said. ''Suppose I should make some. My wife would like that since I spend all our savings on these animals.'' Looking out into the dry distance, the grass stalks snapping in his fingers like twigs, he told an excellent story about the coyote and five dogs and even made himself laugh a little. Then he fell silent and considered his fortunes ''I don't know what I'm doing, this is all I know how to do,'' he said. ''But I'm just going to pray that it gets better.'' And then as though the heavens were listening, a few drops of rain fell and stained the cowboy's shirt."
"It was not an easy sell when the Forest Service came to people living among the crowded trees of the Rockies last summer and said it wanted to set the woods on fire. What the men in green had in mind was not just a little burn, but a big blaze, 8,000 acres of national forest land bordering some very expensive new houses. Homeowners were incensed. Suburban communities said the smoke would hurt people's health. Colorado politicians, from the governor to legislators, tried to stop it and other planned fires, citing fears of flames getting out of control. But this week, the biggest wildfire in Colorado history, the Hayman fire, dropped dead in its tracks when it met the boundary of the fire set deliberately by the Forest Service last year. ''That would scare anyone to death when the government says, 'I'm here to burn down the forest, trust me,' '' said Bob Foster, who owns the Lost Valley Guest Ranch near here, surrounded by Pike National Forest. ''I have a little different take on it now,'' Mr. Foster said, crediting the controlled burn of last year with helping to save his ranch. Convincing people in the West that the only way to save the forest around them is to let the government burn it is perhaps the biggest challenge facing the Forest Service as it tries to reverse a century-old policy of fighting every fire. Western politicians question the government's ability to control burns with surgical skill, citing a fire in New Mexico that was set by the National Park Service near Los Alamos but got out of control and destroyed more than 200 homes two years ago. They also say that there are less risky ways to make forests safe, like logging, but that environmentalists have obstructed government efforts to thin trees. Gov. Jane Dee Hull of Arizona said it was ''policies from the East Coast'' that kept the Forest Service from pruning overgrown forests. Gov. Judy Martz of Montana said environmental groups ''played a great role in the fires,'' by blocking some efforts to log trees. But this summer's blazes show that controlled burns can be crucial in fire prevention. Forest Service officials note that these intentional blazes -- one in Colorado and the other in Arizona -- almost did not happen because of opposition from homeowners and politicians. The Polhemus burn, which edged up to this little town on the South Platte River, 50 miles from Denver, is an example of a government-set fire that worked, the Forest Service said. Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado imposed a summer-long moratorium on planned burns last year, but lifted it in time for the Polhemus burn in October. Governor Owens had said he feared a deliberate fire would get out of control and that the smoke would harm air quality. It is likely that the blaze saved hundreds of homes this month, Forest Service officials said. Even firefighters were surprised at its effectiveness in stopping the Hayman, which consumed 137,000 acres and destroyed 133 homes. ''The fire was racing through here with great intensity but when it hit this controlled burn area, it just laid down and died,'' said Buck Nelson, a Smokejumper supervisor. Had the fire jumped a ridge to the east, it could have hit thousands of homes. As Mr. Nelson and other Forest Service officials walked the boundary of the Hayman fire and the planned burn, they were struck by how well the line held. A cluster of newer homes, surrounded by thick trees, in a village called Rainbow Falls was spared. On one side, the Hayman burned the forest floor and blackened virtually every tree. On the other side, where the Polhemus burned last year, a wider-spaced stand of trees stood, barely touched. The controlled burn consumed brush, low-lying branches and smaller trees, taking away the fuel for a larger fire. Still, in the coming fall, when the Forest Service tries to resume burns, it expects opposition again as memory the Hayman fire fades. The forests in this region have up to 10 times as many trees as they did when fires were allowed to burn a century ago, according to a 1999 federal government report. ''It's not like there's been an overwhelming change of heart,'' said Alan Barbian of the Forest Service. Bruce Beardsley, who was evacuated from his 4,800-square foot home at the southern edge of the Hayman fire, is taking a wait-and-see attitude. ''Controlled burns, if controlled, are probably a good thing,'' said Mr. Beardsley, who is retired and has two homes in Colorado. ''But stupidity sometimes overwhelms reason.'' Homeowners in Arizona have expressed similar reservations, though the Forest Service believes a small, planned burn near Show Low from several years ago was an important firebreak this week. ''There's been a lot of opposition,'' said Rob Emmett, the co-city manager of Show Low, which was evacuated as the biggest fire in Arizona history raced toward it last week. Near Heber-Overgaard, a community now threatened by wildfire, the Forest Service had planned to burn 20,000 acres, after two years of contentious public hearings, but it was destroyed by last week's wildfire. Complaints from just a handful of homeowners about thick smoke can shut down a controlled fire, even after it has started, said Kate Klein, a forest ranger in Arizona. In recent days, some of the political leaders in the West have backed off statements blaming environmentalists for obstructing Forest Service plans to thin and burn. ''The governor would agree that homeowners play a big role in preventing fires, and there is more than enough blame to go around,'' said Francie Noyes, a spokeswoman for Governor Hull of Arizona. Colorado opposed controlled burns last year because of air quality and safety concerns, said Sean Duffy, a spokesman for Governor Owens. ''The governor's view is that prescribed burns have a place,'' Mr. Duffy said. ''But you need to be extremely cautious.'' After becoming a target, environmental groups have pointed to a General Accounting Office report that found that of 1,671 fuel-reduction projects in fiscal year 2001, only one percent were appealed, and none had been litigated. ''They're trying to turn the environmental community into a scapegoat,'' said Bruce Driver, executive director of the Land and Water Fund of the Rockies. Mr. Driver's group opposed some plans to thin trees in a roadless area in the heart of the South Platte watershed. Those objections were dropped when the Forest Service modified the plan. The Forest Service had yet to begin work on the thinning project when the Hayman fire came through this month. Mark Rey, who oversees the Forest Service for the Bush administration, said the General Accounting Office report did not tell the whole story of how much time and energy the government has to spend responding to environmental challenges. Mr. Rey has ordered a new study, which will most likely be completed in the fall, he said. Money to burn and thin forests here and elsewhere in the West is part of the National Fire Plan. Congress has financed about $2 billion for the project, and it has the strong support of the Republican-dominated Western Governors Conference. But in many places of the West -- either because the terrain is too rugged, or the trees too thin to make logging economically viable -- burning is the only way to reduce the density of small, dry trees and brush, foresters say. As the firefighters withdraw from this valley, some people remain skeptical that the government can help them. Outside a home lost to fire, where discarded tires gave further fuel to the Hayman fire, a sign remains: ''No Trespassing -- and this applies to government agents acting under color of law.'' But a more dominant sentiment is expressed in the hundreds of hand-painted signs at homes that border the national forest, thanking firefighters and calling them heroes. ''This is by far, the biggest outpouring of appreciation I've ever seen on a fire,'' said Mr. Nelson, the Smokejumper. ''People are cheering us. Asking us if they can buy us dinner. It makes you feel good.''"
"A third dry summer in a row has brought another wave of forest fires to the American West. With two million acres already gone and summer just begun, it would seem logical for everyone to set differences aside and pursue the sound firefighting strategy devised by the Clinton administration and ratified by President Bush last year. Yet as Pat Williams, a former Montana congressman, observed, ''The only thing that burns hotter than a wildfire in the West is the demagoguery of some politicians trying to take advantage of it.'' This demagoguery comes largely from the right, which is always looking for ways to make environmentalists look bad. The leaders of the pack this year are Jane Dee Hull and Judy Martz, the governors of Arizona and Montana. Their mantra, minus the subtleties, is this: Log the trees, and they won't burn. The man generally blamed for the present crisis is Bill Clinton. To his critics, he is a political naïf who was suckered by radical ''ecosystem management'' notions that reduced the commercial timber harvest and left the woods vulnerable to fire. That is, of course, a preposterous reading of nature and history, not to mention of Mr. Clinton. Ecosystem management -- managing the forests to protect watersheds and the wildlife and humans who depend on them, rather than commercial interests alone -- took root in the first Bush administration. That is also when logging began to decline, largely as a result of Judge William Dwyer's landmark decision to protect huge swaths of spotted owl habitat in the Pacific Northwest from clear-cutting. The notion that environmental lawsuits have hindered fire-prevention projects is equally absurd. According to a federal study last summer, fewer than 1 percent of 1,671 fire-prevention projects had been appealed. A greater obstacle to fire prevention may have been the governors themselves, some of whom have resisted the Forest Service's proven strategy of preventing larger fires with smaller, controlled burns. Fortunately, reasonable people on both sides, including cooler heads in the current Bush administration, agree on what the problem is and how to approach it. The basic cause of the problem is a now-discredited Forest Service strategy of suppressing all fires as quickly as possible. The policy took hold after the aptly named Big Burn in Idaho and Montana in 1910 and by 1947 had a popular mascot, Smokey Bear. By disrupting the natural cycle of fires, however, this strategy left the forests choked with dry fuel -- small trees and bushes -- that turned modest fires into roaring infernos. Excessive logging had the same effect because it removed the biggest and most fire-resistant trees and left behind a tinderbox of ''slash'' and young trees. The Smokey line of thinking gradually fell from favor. In 2000, in the midst of roaring fires that eventually consumed 8.4 million acres, the Clinton administration and six Western governors agreed on a fresh approach. It consisted essentially of controlled burns plus an aggressive program to thin the underbrush, especially in vulnerable areas known as the ''wildland/urban interface,'' where an increasing number of people have built homes near the forests. Congress liked the plan and opened its pocketbook: $1.7 billion in new money in 2001 and $1.2 billion for the present fiscal year. Some legislators have complained that the money is not flowing fast enough to underwrite the local thinning programs at the heart of the strategy. The administration has pledged to step things up. Others want the administration to require local communities to change their building codes as a condition of future government help. In Colorado, despite a statewide campaign to get everyone to take precautionary steps, only 33 of the state's 64 counties have voluntarily developed fire plans, which in most cases require the use of fire-retardant building materials. Meanwhile, a truce is required in the ideological wars. The environmentalists must not erect unreasonable legal barriers to fire-suppression projects adjacent to populated areas. For its part, the administration must not use ''thinning'' as a cover for commercial logging or as an excuse to invade remote roadless areas of the national forests, which are not particularly prone to fires anyway. This is no time for partisan sniping."
"''Pray for rain,'' say the signs posted along the Fort Apache Indian Reservation roads. The springs are drying up here, and the forest is an angry inferno. The monsoons are supposed to arrive next week but there are no signs that they will get here soon. The medicine man has called for a rain ceremony tonight, the first in years. While national attention is focused on the threat Arizona's wildfires pose to Show Low, the resort town 40 miles northeast of here, the blaze has already brought widespread and lasting economic damage to Apache country. Questions over the origin of the fire have also rekindled longstanding tensions between the white and the Indian communities. Consider that both the Rodeo and Chediski fires started here last week on the White Mountain Apache territory, home to 13,500 people. The fires have merged, sending anvil-like clouds high into the sky and casting flames across the vista. Sixty percent of the fire is on Indian land. Of the 350,000 acres of timber already destroyed, more than 200,000 are here on this 1.6 million-acre reservation. The tribal economy is devastated. This is the time when the trees are supposed to be harvested but that will not happen. More than $300 million worth of timber has been turned to ash. The sawmills have shut down and 300 people are out of work. ''No water and it hurts,'' said Johnny Endfield, vice chairman of the White Mountain Apache, who had just toured the southern flank of the Chediski fire, which was caused by a hiker lost in the woods. ''That timber has been here since before our time,'' Mr. Endfield said. ''And in less than 30 minutes it's all gone. Gone for us and gone for our unborn.'' While 5 percent of the fire is under control, officials said, it seems to be sprawling in every direction. ''It's still going to be a long time -- several days -- before we get the upper hand on this fire,'' Jim Paxon, a spokesman for the United States Forest Service, said. Flames spun by the wind continued to move northwest near Heber-Overgaard, where 10 homes were destroyed on Monday. ''It's nothing but a wall of smoke and we can't see nothing,'' said Richardson Antonio, an Apache firefighter and division supervisor in the area, speaking by cellphone from near Heber-Overgaard. ''We got to get the hell out of here,'' he said. ''It looks like it took out houses down by the stand of ponderosa trees.'' To the south, spot fires regained momentum as the winds continued to gust at 20 miles per hour. The area is covered in a thick, white ash, making it look like an Ansel Adams winterscape. Normally nocturnal coyote, elk and rabbits skittered across the bulldozed roads in the middle of the day, a bad sign, the Apaches said. About 1,500 firefighters are battling the blaze on the southern and western flanks, about 2,500 north and east around the towns of Show Low, Heber-Overgaard and Pinedale, officials said. They are Indians and white people, college students and full-time, professional firefighters. Linton Ethelbah, a firefighter with Fort Apache Engine 407, and his four-man crew were battling the flames with a pumper truck on Tuesday. Life here cannot exist without trees, he explained. Without their shade, people are naked and exposed. A fire-starting thunderbolt, a camp fire, a flare can be a cataclysm because a man cannot survive longer than his shadow. ''This is the strangest fire I ever seen,'' said Mr. Ethelbah, who explained how the Chediski fire had chased him and his crew up a bluff last week. ''It's just tremendous; half the size of Rhode Island they tell me.'' Tim Rash, a white man and a firefighter with the Bureau of Land Management, was clearing underbrush near the Apache crew as trees exploded like popcorn kernels. He does the job for thrills. ''I saw a fire like this once in 1988 in Yosemite,'' Mr. Rash said. ''You know what we did? We let it burn until the snows came.'' Although the Yosemite decision proved wise, as the national park is green and thriving again, letting their forests burn is not an option for the Apache people. To let the forest burn will mean economic ruin. The Hon Dah Resort and Casino, the second-largest employer in the White Mountain region after the county government, brings in more than $130 million a year, and is now closed for what is normally its busiest season. The tribe also operates Sun Rise Ski Resort. ''We sell our beautiful lakes and streams to tourists,'' Roger Leslie, the general manager of the resort, said. ''We don't know what we'll have until the smoke clears.'' Other potential losses of income come from the damage to wildlife. The tribe sold about 65 permits to hunt elk on the reservation last year at an average price of $15,000. There are also bear and mountain lion hunts. The hunting grounds are in the area of the Chediski fire, along with a sacred lake, burial grounds and archeological sites. There is an undertone of ill will running throughout the region. Indians feel sorry about the fire, the bigger one started north of the Red Dust Rodeo Grounds here, and word on the reservation is that it was set by a teenager from the Cibecue community. While authorities continue to investigate the fire's origin, resentment is growing among white people in some northern towns. Threatening messages have been left on the answering machine of Dallas Massey, the tribal chairman, laying blame for the fire at the feet of the Apache. Off-handed racial slurs have been tossed at the Indians shopping in the discount stores in the area, accusing them of intellectual inferiority. These people seem to forget that the Chediski fire was started by a white woman, lost in the wilderness, who lighted an illegal fire to attract the attention of a news helicopter. Few reporters have come to the reservation. Little emergency aid has been sent to White River, the seat of tribal government, though 1,500 Apaches have been evacuated from their homes. Some are staying at the Chief Alchesay Activity Center, some with relatives on the reservation, some in tent cities near the trickling rivers. President Bush did not set foot here on his visit on Tuesday although dozens of Indians stood in the afternoon sun along Highway 60 at the rumor that he might drive through. ''We've done all we could,'' said Herbert Tate, a board member of the Fort Apache Timber Company, explaining that the Apache forests are not clearcut, but are thinned and managed year round. ''We were burning out underbrush last year until residents of Phoenix complained that the smoke was drifting into the city and making their air quality poor,'' Mr. Tate said. ''The problem is not management. The problem is a lack of water.'' So now the region's air is thick with smoke from the early summer's fires. Despite the drought, sprinklers continued to feed the suburban lawns in Phoenix last night. Meanwhile back at the fire camp, the men stretched out on the roofs of their trucks, staring at the 300-foot flames devouring the timber line along the ridges. Lightning was predicted for the morning, they were told."
"Bedraggled and blackened, firefighters on the front lines of Arizona's most devastating fire seemed resigned today, eight days after being summoned here, to a long battle against the flames. Warily watching the sky for dry lightning, the kind of phenomenon that habitually sparks blazes in bone-dry woodlands like those around this evacuated town, firefighters pressed their efforts to suppress the Rodeo-Chediski fire's northeastern flank, barely a mile from here. ''It's still going to be a long time -- several days -- before we get the upper hand on this fire,'' a Forest Service spokesman, Jim Paxon, said this morning. ''Mother Nature still has a major role to play. She can still throw us some curve balls.'' The Rodeo-Chediski fire is enlarging on several fronts, including an approach to Cibecue on the southern rim of the fire and the entire western flank of the fire. Fire officials, who put the size of the blaze at about 640 square miles, were concerned with wind gusts this afternoon, which made the job of holding the Show Low line more difficult. The fire has so far cost $7.8 million to fight. There was a flurry here when officials announced that a man had been arrested on suspicion of starting the Rodeo fire. He was a resident of Show Low, a town of 8,000 residents, and was wandering the streets in violation of the evacuation order. He ran, heightening the suspicion of the police. They arrested him, but he will not be charged in relation to the fire, officials said. The Forest Service came under criticism today from residents of Pinedale and Heber-Overgaard, towns west of here that sustained fire damage to a number of houses. Some residents quoted by The Arizona Republic said firefighters under orders from Forest Service incident command teams pulled out of Pinedale prematurely late last week, allowing some 17 houses to burn, and failed to use adequate resources to battle the fire when it touched Heber-Overgaard, where about 250 structures were lost. ''It's really hard to please everybody,'' Jim Clawson, a law enforcement coordinator with the Forest Service, said in an interview. ''That fire came into that community at a roar. We had to move our folks out because we could have killed somebody.'' Mr. Clawson said the firefighters were confronted by flames of 200 to 300 feet high in Pinedale. ''You don't put somebody in front of that,'' he said. ''As soon as that fire came through our folks went back in, and they tried to save as many homes as they could. We saved more homes by far than we lost.'' A tour today of the Pinedale area, about nine miles northwest of here, showed several burned houses, including one owned by Mark Killian, a former speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives and currently director of the state's Department of Revenue. Other houses survived the scorching of the woods around them, thanks in part, it appeared, to fire lines dug by bulldozers. ''Nature is really interesting, which houses it chooses to burn and which it doesn't,'' said Danny Randall, a ranger with the Bureau of Land Management, based in New Mexico. He pointed to a large, intact wood cabin with a sign over the driveway with the legend, ''Bare Necessities Ranch.'' ''That's one lucky resident,'' he said. ''There's plenty of fuel there. You'd think this house would have burned, but it didn't.'' At least 10 firefighters have been injured on the Rodeo-Chediski blaze, none seriously, but more than 800 have visited medical units, many of them for respiratory problems. About 2,875 firefighters and support workers are at the fire, which was just 5 percent contained today. ''I've got blisters on both feet, man,'' said Mario Chacon, a 19-year-old firefighter from Ontario, Oregon, who stood in a long line at the only store open for business here, Kmart, buying spam, potato chips and other essentials. He looked tired, his face lined with soot, after being here for eight days. ''I can't remember the last time I took a shower,'' he said. ''Sometimes we go for weeks like this.''"
"The Forest Service employee charged with starting the largest wildfire in Colorado history was indicted today by a federal grand jury on four counts that could bring up to 40 years in prison. The grand jury acted three days after the employee, Terry Lynn Barton, was arrested. She is scheduled to appear on Thursday in federal District Court for a bail hearing. The United States attorney for Colorado, John W. Suthers, said the indictment, which supersedes a three-count complaint, ''reflects the government's contention that the Hayman fire was deliberately set.'' Ms. Barton, 38, now faces charges that she purposely set federal lands on fire, that the fire destroyed federal property and that it injured at least one firefighter. A fourth charge, that she used fire to commit the three previous counts, would add 10 years to any guilty verdict. The indictment differs from the original complaint. It suggests that firefighters had been injured in their work, the most serious of the four counts. The indictment does not include an earlier charge that Ms. Barton lied to investigators. The fire began on June 8 in the Pike National Forest. Mr. Suthers said it had grown, to 135,000 acres, and was 40 percent contained. Officials said Ms. Barton first said that she had come upon the fire and called for help and that she changed her account to say she accidentally started the blaze when she burned a letter by her estranged husband."
"As firefighters reported modest progress in Colorado's two largest wildfires, a fast-growing blaze in eastern Arizona was pummeling small towns today as it became the largest fire in state history. The Arizona blaze, known as the Rodeo fire, began on Tuesday and has grown to about 200 square miles, forcing 8,000 people to flee a line of communities west of the town of Show Low. More than 10,000 other people have been told to be prepared to evacuate. The fire has destroyed at least 35 buildings. As a measure of its ferocity, the fire grew to 120,000 by early today from 1,200 acres on Wednesday. But firefighters were focused not only on trying to keep it from burning more of the parched Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. They were also concerned that it could connect with the smaller but fast-growing Chediski fire nine miles to the west. Jim Paxon, a spokesman for the United States Forest Service in Show Low, said fire experts were worrying that the two fires could converge by Sunday, making a fire that is more dangerous than each of its parts. ''It's quite a phenomenon,'' Mr. Paxon said. ''Together, they would run harder and burn hotter and create much more velocity.'' He also said that the fires could easily burn for three more weeks, basing his prediction on weather forecasts that say Arizona's annual heavy rains, which usually start in early July, are expected a week later this year. ''If they're that late,'' he said, ''the fires are going to be here.'' The Chediski fire was set off by a hiker who lost his way and signaled for help by starting a fire. The origin of the Rodeo is uncertain. The Arizona fires have pushed national firefighting efforts to an unusual level for June. With 18 large fires burning in eight states -- Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming -- the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, declared the country at Level 5, the earliest that has ever been reached. It means that fires are raging in more than two geographical areas, and that they have the potential to exhaust all available federal firefighters and fire equipment. Typically, Level 5 alerts are issued late in the summer fire season, in July or August. But already this year, 1.99 million acres have burned, according to the fire center, more than twice the 10-year average for the entire year. The Rodeo fire was commanding the most concern. In some places, the fire grew so hot that fire crews were pulled off the lines. Plumes of dark smoke rose several hundred feet and were visible as far away as Phoenix, 125 miles to the west. ''It was the eeriest thing I ever saw,'' said Jill Stobel, whose family was forced on Wednesday to evacuate their remote house in Linden. Mrs. Stobel and her husband, Steve, their three children and two dogs have been living in Round Valley High School in Eagar since then. ''We feel like we're on a roller coaster,'' Mrs. Stobel said. ''One minute it looks like the fire is going away. The next, it's getting closer. It's so unpredictable.'' For a second day, crews working on the Hayman fire, the largest in Colorado history, reported making progress, if progress can be considered stalling its appetite for ponderosa pine trees. ''We've held our lines for the last two days,'' said Gordon Warren, a spokesman for the Forest Service. Even so, the fire has destroyed at least 79 homes and kept 8,100 evacuees from returning. Tonight, a van carrying firefighters to the fire crashed near Parachute, killing four passengers, The Associated Press reported. The seven others in the van, which was being driven from La Grande, Ore., were taken to a hospital, officials said. A trial date was set today for the Forest Service worker who is accused of starting the fire, Terry Lynn Barton. Jury selection will begin on Aug. 26 in Federal District Court in Denver before Judge Richard P. Matsch. The other major blaze in Colorado, the Mission Ridge fire burning near Durango, also slowed today, growing only 1,000 acres -- compared with 4,100 on Thursday -- for a total of 60,000 burned."
"For more than 150 years, people raised within sight of the giant sequoias that tower over the eastern horizon here have looked to the forest for their livelihood. Beyond pursuits like logging and catering to tourists, many sought work in taming the wildfires that any woodland must endure. With their lives dedicated to preserving the trees, they are all the more astounded that one of their own, Terry Lynn Barton, 38, who grew up here and who went into forestry when she was 20, has been charged with sparking the largest forest fire in Colorado's history. The notion that a local woman could be an arsonist runs counter to every principle of logic, and has reverberated through people's conversations here in Dunlap, an unincorporated town with no center and all the signs of a withered economy. ''Most of the families that live here are connected with forestry in some regard,'' said Connie Work, 49, a longtime friend who employed Ms. Barton for several years as a baby sitter for her five children. ''If you love it, you want to protect it.'' Ms. Barton, a mother of two teenage girls whose job with the United States Forest Service included fire prevention, has admitted causing the Hayman Fire, which has grown to more than 136,000 acres since it began on June 8 in the Pike National Forest south of Denver. The people of Dunlap, in the foothills between the San Joaquin Valley and the Sierra Nevada, 30 miles east of Fresno, are unaccustomed to the kind of attention the Barton case has brought. With about 6,000 people spread over a wide, hilly area that includes Dunlap, Miramonte, Pinehurst and Squaw Valley, the region is notable for what it lacks, like shopping malls, commercial strips and other signs of urban sprawl. Dunlap's landmarks are a Baptist church, a community center, a post office and a middle school with a softball field. A sign in the grass across the road promises that a high school will be built, but people are not sure when. Aside from the San Joaquin Valley's fruit farms and ranches, much of the area's focus is on the looming woodlands, divided into the Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks, the Giant Sequoia National Monument and the Sequoia National Forest. A sign on Dunlap Road, put up by local fire officials, offers a $10,000 reward for ''arson information.'' Another sign, on Highway 180 as it leads into town from the west, says, ''Californians Can't Afford Wildfires.'' Saving the forests is a serious mission, and kids here grow up with it as a guiding principle. ''That's about all there is up here -- forestry,'' said Janette Regedal, the daughter of a forest service worker, who returned to live in Dunlap six years ago after she tried living in other towns in the San Joaquin Valley. ''You get a feel for it here and you can't stay away.'' Ms. Regedal spoke as she waited tables at the only restaurant in Dunlap, Clingan's Junction. On its walls, photographs taken here in the late 19th and early 20th centuries show stagecoaches and gold miners, loggers and their ox teams pulling trees out of the woods to make houses and build cities. Ms. Barton, who moved to Colorado five years ago with her husband and two daughters and continued working for the forest service, told arson investigators that she started the fire by accident while ridding herself of a letter from her estranged husband, John. In a four-count indictment, she has been charged with setting the blaze deliberately. People here do not believe that. Her friends and relatives acknowledged that she may have been careless, but they refused to accept any suggestion of malice. ''There's no way she would have done it on purpose,'' said Ms. Barton's mother, Wanda Haddock. ''She loves that job.'' As a young girl, Ms. Barton, who has two siblings, Carla and Bill Jr., watched relatives, friends and neighbors go into forest work. ''Even as a teenager that was always her interest,'' said Ms. Work, who recalls hiring 12-year-old Terry as a baby sitter and general helper at a campground she owned, Dunlap Valley Lakes. ''She would work in any capacity -- cleaning the showers, the laundromat,'' Ms. Work said. The business evolved into a hand-glider operation, attracting fliers from all over the country. ''It definitely broadened her horizons,'' said Ms. Work, whose father was a logger. ''But even with her horizons broadened, the choices here were still limited pretty much to forestry.'' Until her arrest on Sunday, Ms. Barton was a forestry technician, a job that entails patrolling for, among other things, illegal campfires. It is paradoxical, people here say, that someone entrusted with fire prevention had sparked a huge conflagration. ''I'd compare it to a plumber with screwed-up plumbing or a mechanic whose car doesn't run,'' said Tammy Ahumada, a volunteer firefighter with the Mountain Valley Fire Department here, which covers 200 square miles west of the Sequoia and Kings Canyon national forests. Helen Clingan, the doyenne of the area's long-established families and the author of a book on its history, lamented the situation. ''She has to have been very disturbed by the letter to have done something like that, because she would have been trained not to,'' Mrs. Clingan said. Les Chappel, owner of the L & L Mountain Feed and Hay store, said he has known Ms. Barton for more years than he remembers. ''She's not one to draw attention to herself -- never has been,'' he said. ''She was just in a lousy marriage to John. That's why they moved to Colorado, so they could start again.''"
"A wildfire near here has burned more than 500 square miles, and it and other fires burning now in the West will have swept over hundreds more before they are put out or burn themselves out. America is fighting the fires -- as it fights Western forest fires every year -- as if it were conducting military campaigns. Helicopters circle overhead, airplanes drop heavy loads of firefighting chemicals, uniformed firefighters march to the front and lines of refugees stream out of burning towns. There is a way out of the vicious spiral that replays these scenes, sometimes with this year's degree of severity, sometimes with less. But it requires that we rethink fire management in ways that demand adjustments in much of American society, not simply at its fire agencies. Fires flourish in the American West partly because much of the landscape is inherently fire-prone. It undergoes rhythms of moisture, producing trees and brush in wetter years that will fuel forest fires in the dry ones. And it is subject to dry lightning -- electrical storms without rain. It is natural for such a place to burn, and the species that live naturally in these areas are adapted to periodic fires. Within nature's economy, fire is an agent of creative destruction. But people have enhanced this natural susceptibility to fire. They kindle fires. They have changed public wild lands in ways that increase their flammability. And for many decades they actively sought to abolish fire, disrupting historic rhythms and making the inevitable fires more ferocious. There are three strategies for dealing with the fire-prone West: convert the land to something less combustible, do the burning ourselves or rely on suppression. The United States needs to use all three options -- and in innovative mixes. Converting combustible land works best where fire is dangerous and damaging -- in areas around houses, for example. What many areas need is a kind of woody weeding, which removes woody vegetation that has replaced natural grasses -- but not logging, because the debris or slash left from clear-cutting is among the most hazardous fuels imaginable. By allowing some landscapes to become overgrown with small woody plants, we have created a living equivalent to slash. Yet limited controlled fires do not necessarily reduce the overall fire hazards. Putting fire back into the landscape is not the simple reverse of taking it out -- it is more like reintroducing a lost species. The fire will behave according to its habitat. The fires we introduce deliberately must be set where we have readied the landscape for them, by clearing thickets and brush, for example, and restoring some natural grasses. As for suppressing fire, it is at best a temporary act. It deprives a fire-prone land of the good fires it needs -- small and contained, in areas where fuels have grown up naturally -- and encourages large fires that can savage it. We can improve each of these strategies. We need to agree that some places need grasses restored, and we ought to devise better ways to do it without either scalping the land or allowing growth to clog landscapes. We need to invent better techniques for burning. Presently our burns are most successful in blocks of uniform fuel like slash or prairie. We need to learn to initiate burns in complex forests, and this will require new techniques. In the United States, technology has rarely been used as a substitute for manpower in fighting fires. We conduct our military-style campaigns, using thousands of firefighters, when we ought to find ways to combine fewer, better trained special forces with high technology. We also need to create rural fire brigades as a kind of volunteer fire militia that can assist in firefighting, particularly when housing developments are threatened, as an alternative to blanket evacuations that empty towns of any force that could stand against the flames. All of this will not eliminate fire, but it can limit the devastating fires and help promote ecologically benign ones. Although every summer seems to bring another analysis of the ''fire problem,'' America does not have one fire problem. It has many fire problems. Some, like the construction of houses along the forest fringe, are amenable to technical solutions, like zoning laws and fire codes that would abolish wooden roofs, for example. Some, like the need to accept fire in wilderness, must be dealt with politically. Others require site-by-site assessments and site-specific practices. We must shun the fire fundamentalists: those who would abolish fire or accept only natural fire in the wilderness, and their sympathizers who seek to exploit fire only to animate some other agenda -- like logging or opposition to it. We, as a species, hold a monopoly over the manipulation of fire, and it's time we accepted the responsibility that comes with that power. Stephen J. Pyne is a professor in the biology department of Arizona State University and author of ''Year of the Fires: The Story of the Great Fires of 1910.''"
"This is a town that was named for a stroke of luck, so maybe the fact it was still standing today is not so surprising. Working overnight and all day, fire crews cut lines to the south today and ''back burned'' an area between the town and the fire, a strategy to protect the largest area of population under siege by the worst forest fire in Arizona history and the biggest in the nation this year. ''This has been some of the most climactic fire behavior in the United States in the last 50 years,'' said Jim Paxon, a spokesman for the Fire Service, describing a ferocious blaze that has crunched through more than 330,000 acres of northern Arizona in the last seven days. ''But we slammed the door on it with a major frontal assault on the back side,'' Mr. Paxon added, and that provided many people here a glimmer of hope for the first time in days -- strange as that seemed in such a surreal atmosphere. Today, the sky here was orange- gray in spots, purple in others, as if some psychedelic smog had rolled in. Air was heavy with the taste and smell of smoke. Ashes fell like snowflakes, and apart from the steady buzz of activity at the fire command center, Show Low was silent. The town's 8,000 residents had been evacuated, along with 17,000 others from neighboring communities, and streets were deserted. Businesses were shuttered. The only traffic came from fire trucks and law enforcement vehicles. But with new teams of firefighters arriving by the hour and the march of the fire slowing a bit, officials expressed optimism that the town could be saved, although they conceded that small ''spot fires,'' caused by falling cinders, could damage or destroy homes. ''A lot of ash is falling,'' said Jim Clawson, law enforcement liaison for local governments, ''but I'm hoping in a couple of days we can get a bottle of Champagne to pop the cork.'' Time will tell. What fire officials feared most was that the blaze -- now known as Rodeo-Chediski fire, after separate fires converged on Sunday -- would hook around the fire lines, charge through the back burn and head to town. Fire lines are wide troughs dug by bulldozers and work crews to clear out trees, shrubs and underbrush. Sunday night, crews ignited the material between a new five-mile line in Cottonwood Canyon, south of town, at a time when the blaze was not moving that way. By doing that, a crucial defensive tactic, a shift of wind would not provide the fire fuel needed to roar toward Show Low. Through much of today, the strategy was working. Slowed by softer winds, the fire grew by 39,050 acres on Sunday, compared with 103,450 the day before. It was enough of a stall to allow area residents for the first time in days to start thinking about what they might return to after the fire has passed. For many, it was not an altogether pleasant thought. ''This hits you right in the heart,'' said Charles Sprung, a plumbing contractor and the son of a fire chief who worked the lines on Sunday and awaited the return today of his two sons, J. R. and Josh, who were working the lines today. The Sprungs have lived in Show Low for 26 years. ''This has hurt us,'' Mr. Sprung said. ''How many people don't know what they're coming back to? They're going to be devastated. They don't have a clue what this is going to do to our little economy.'' Two groups, especially, are certain to be hurt by the fires -- residents of the Show Low area and the 13,000 White Mountain Apaches who live on the reservation to the southwest. So far, the reservation has absorbed about 55 percent of the fire; the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, which includes the White Mountains, the rest. Show Low was named by a local rancher who won a hand of cards in 1876, when his opponent said, ''Show low, and you win.'' The rancher, Croyden E. Cooley, drew a 2 of clubs and, by agreement, won his opponent's ranch and the right to name the town. The main street here is called Deuce of Clubs Drive. Like generations who followed, Cooley was drawn to the majestic beauty of the place. In recent decades, it has become a strong magnet for tourists, second-home owners and retirees. Revenues from tourism keep the town alive. Timber mills provide the Apache with much of their revenue. Chief Dallas Massey said today the fire had burned away 160 million board-feet of trees, and that the two mills are closed -- crushing blows to the tribal economy. ''That's major by terms of the effects it will have on us,'' he said. ''We'll be feeling that for years to come now.'' For the most part, the Apache and other area residents live in harmony. But not always. Chief Massey said tribe members were preparing last fall to conduct prescribed burns, as they have in the past, in Hop Canyon, an area southwest of Show Low. Neighbors complained because they did not want to smell smoke, he said. So plans were canceled. When the fire roared through Hop Canyon over the weekend, officials began fearing the worst for Show Low. The fears turned to a mass mobilization of personnel and equipment to save the town, which meant more assets at the southeastern flank to coax the fire into other directions and, today, structural firefighters were assigned to patrol Show Low streets to respond to spot fires. They became part of a firefighting force that today grew to 2,233 fighters on 60 crews, 52 bulldozers, 108 fire engines, 22 water-carrying vehicles, 8 helicopters and 3 tanker planes. And more help was on the way. Several crews arrived today, including the Lewis and Clark Hotshots from Great Falls, Mont. A team of 20 members drove for two days to get here, parked their truck and awaited instructions. For one team member, Matt Stott, 19, this was just his second fire. He pronounced himself ''excited, but at the same time a little nervous because this is such a big fire.'' Montanans are used to big fires. The biggest ever in American history burned 4 million acres of Montana and Idaho in 1910. Ever since, firefighting has been an especially honorable vocation. And now, Mr. Stott said, more so. He would never put himself in the same category as ''city firefighters,'' he insisted, particularly those who responded to the World Trade Center attacks last September. ''They have a lot tougher job.'' But they did him and his co-workers a favor, he said. ''After 9/11, people seem to be more open-minded toward us, more appreciative,'' Mr. Stott said. ''I think they realize that we're out there, putting our necks on the line for them. That's our job.''"
"Federal investigators have concluded that the Forest Service employee charged with starting a fire that has burned more than 100,000 acres in central Colorado set the blaze deliberately and lied when she said she had done so accidentally by burning a letter inside a campfire ring, a senior Forest Service official said today. The official said investigators had found burned underbrush positioned in such a way outside the ring, set up to prevent campfires from spreading beyond a contained area, to suggest that the employee, Terry Lynn Barton, intended to start a fire and that burning the letter might have had nothing to do with the blaze, the largest in Colorado history. The investigators, he said, are not even certain that she burned anything inside the ring. ''They knew immediately that the fire was set,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''They found enough material to know that it was more than two sheets of paper burned that caused the fire.'' Ms. Barton, a seasonal employee of the Forest Service for 18 years who lives in Florissant, Colo., and is the mother of two teenage girls, is scheduled to appear in Federal District Court on Thursday, when the government will present its case, much of it based on an investigation that points to the underbrush as the point of origin. Prosecutors are expected to argue that there is enough evidence that a crime has been committed and that Ms. Barton is a flight risk who should not be released on bail before a trial. If the judge agrees, prosecutors will take Ms. Barton before a federal grand jury to seek an indictment. Ms. Barton's federal public defender, Warren Williamson, declined to discuss any aspect of the case other than to acknowledge the time and place of the hearing and to predict that they could take several days. His client faces up to 20 years in prison and fines of up to $750,000 on federal charges that she set fire to federal lands, caused damage in excess of $1,000 and knowingly misled investigators. Today, Colorado's attorney general, Ken Salazar, met with the United States attorney for Colorado, John W. Suthers, and prosecutors from four counties affected by the fire to discuss whether state charges should also be filed. A decision is not expected for a few days, Mr. Salazar said. Investigators have not determined why Ms. Barton would have ignited a fire at a time when a ban against open fires was in effect because of persistent warm and dry weather. The cause of any large wildfire is routinely investigated by the Forest Service, and Ms. Barton drew the immediate attention of the investigators when she was the first person to summon help after she said she spotted a fire in the Pike National Forest in a routine patrol on June 8. After interviews on June 10 and 13, according to the criminal complaint, investigators said they found that her explanation of where she was when she said she smelled smoke was inconsistent with wind conditions and other factors. In a third interview, on June 15,, investigators confronted Ms. Barton with the anomalies. She then said she had not discovered a fire at all but had become angry over a letter from her estranged husband, John Barton, and had set it afire in a campfire ring. Ms. Barton told the investigators that she waited until the flames had extinguished, but after circling back to the campsite discovered a fire growing out of control in grass and pine trees. She said she called for help and tried to extinguish the fire. She was arrested on Sunday. The Forest Service official said even that version of events made little sense to investigators when compared with evidence they found at the campsite, a conclusion reflected in the complaint, which said ''the fire was deliberately set and had been staged to look like an escaped campfire.'' The complaint provided no details, but the official said investigators were persuaded by the amount of underbrush placed in a way that appeared that it had been used to set a fire. Jeff Dorschner, a spokesman for the United States attorney for Colorado, said the charges against Ms. Barton, for now, only referred to starting ''a fire,'' wording that avoids the determination whether the fire was a campfire or forest fire. Mr. Williamson, Ms. Barton's lawyer, would not say where his client was being held, and there was no response to telephone messages left at the Barton home. A Justice Department official said members of Ms. Barton's family had been interviewed. Neither that official nor the Forest Service one knew whether the investigators had met with her husband to ask if he had actually sent his wife a letter that could have upset her. The couple have been separated about a year. The blaze, known as the Hayman wildfire, meanwhile, grew again today. Fueled by swirling winds and temperatures in the mid-90's, it reached nearly 120,000 acres as it bore down on Woodland Park, northwest of Colorado Springs. It remains less than half contained. The fire has forced at least 5,500 people from their homes. At least 25 houses have burned, officials said. -------------------- Firefighting Planes Grounded (By The Associated Press) The nation's C-130A air tankers, the workhorse of the firefighting fleet, were grounded yesterday amid what could become one of the worst fire seasons in history after a plane lost its wings on Monday and nose-dived in Northern California, killing all three people aboard. The five C-130A tankers are only a fraction of the National Interagency Fire Center's fleet of 43 contract planes. Nancy Lull, a spokeswoman for the fire center in Boise, Idaho, said the tankers would be grounded for at least two days while their safety was evaluated. The tanker that crashed on Monday was fighting a 10,000-acre blaze north of Yosemite National Park. The plane's owner, Hawkins & Powers Aviation of Greybull, Wyo., notified the Federal Aviation Administration in April 1998 that an inspection had found two inchlong cracks in the surface of one of the plane's wings, according to an F.A.A. document obtained by The A.P. The damage was repaired, and no subsequent problems were reported, a company employee said last night."
"Fire is a mysterious force, both protector and destroyer. Even when it's burning snugly in the hearth, we can sense its power, and when it gets out of control, all our instincts tell us to run the other way. Firefighters run toward the heat, and that is the source of their mystique, the aura of heroism that hangs over even the sleepiest of firehouses. In pyromaniacs, all these primal emotions get twisted up. But the scenario authorities are building around the Colorado forest fires sounds even more perverse. A longtime Forest Service employee, Terry Lynn Barton, has been charged with deliberately setting the biggest fire in the state's history. Ms. Barton's job was to warn campers not to start fires in the woods, which are bone dry from summer heat and drought. She was the first to report the fire, which has consumed more than 136,000 acres of Colorado woodland and is still raging. At first she told authorities she smelled the smoke and went to investigate. Then she acknowledged that she had done the exact thing she was paid to prevent. In her admission, she spread some of the blame to her estranged husband, who she said sent her a letter so upsetting she felt compelled to burn it. Now authorities say neither of those stories is true, and that Ms. Barton -- whose family said she was so dedicated a Forest Service worker that she talked of nothing else -- deliberately started the blaze and attempted to disguise the arson as a campfire gone out of control. It's possible that Ms. Barton was hungry for the glory that the public naturally bestows on firefighters. Volunteer firemen in small towns have occasionally been charged with starting small blazes and then leading the charge to put them out. Like the volunteers, Forest Service workers are supposed to be on the lookout all the time, but rarely see the real thing. Perhaps Ms. Barton, tired of waiting, created a threat so she could then play the hero. If so, she undervalued her own profession. One of the hard things about firefighting is that most of it involves doing little but waiting and watching. On its edges, in jobs like Ms. Barton's, it requires a mixture of alertness and restraint, an acceptance of the fact that simply being there, and being ready, is point enough."
"A federal judge ruled today that the United States Forest Service worker accused of setting Colorado's largest wildfire could spend the weeks before trial in a halfway house, rather than in jail as government prosecutors had requested. The decision came after testimony in which the government offered a rough outline of its case against the worker, Terry Lynn Barton, and the defense provided clues as to what might have led her to set off a fire that has now consumed more than 136,000 acres. Ms. Barton, who has worked 18 years for the Forest Service, pleaded not guilty to the four criminal counts against her even though she confessed to investigators before her arrest on Sunday that she set off a fire on June 8 inside the Pike National Forest while a ban was in effect against fires of any kind inside the forest. She faces a minimum of 17 years in prison and fines of $1 million if convicted on the charges. Today, in the arguments over whether she should be held before trial, a Forest Service investigator testified to the acts that led to the charges against Ms. Barton, and seven defense witnesses told the court she was of exemplary character. Through all that, however, two mysteries remained: How she set off the fire and why. Under questioning from an assistant United States attorney, William L. Taylor, the investigator, Brenda Schultz, said Ms. Barton's version of events was inconsistent with evidence. Ms. Schultz said Ms. Barton's assertion that she set off the fire by lighting a two-page letter from her estranged husband that made her angry was not supported by the evidence. Ms. Schultz said investigators at the scene, a campfire ring, did not believe that the ashes found inside the ring were the residue of paper and that tests were being conducted to confirm that. She said Ms. Barton's husband, John, told investigators that he had not given her a letter that day or earlier. Rather, Ms. Schultz said, investigators found rocks around the campfire moved in a way to facilitate a fast-burning fire that began with grasses inside the ring and spread quickly through underbrush to nearby trees. A family friend told reporters on Wednesday in Squaw Valley, Calif., that there was a letter. The friend, Connie Work, said that the Barton daughters had found an old ''love letter'' from their father to Ms. Barton, which they put inside Ms. Barton's backpack that day. Ms. Work said Ms. Barton discovered it after going on patrol the day of the fire ''and she just wanted to get rid of it.'' Just as Mr. Taylor led Ms. Schultz through a chronology of events involving federal investigators that included three interviews with Ms. Barton before her arrest, Warren Williams, her federal public defender, used a parade of Ms. Barton's friends and colleagues to show she was a loving, caring mother of two who has been struggling through efforts to divorce her husband. Each character witness described Ms. Barton in glowing terms. One of them, Stephanie Howard, a wildlife biologist, told Mr. Williams that Ms. Barton's husband had drinking and emotional problems that weighed heavily on his wife. Ms. Howard said Ms. Barton was so eager to stay away from him that the night before the fire, when Mr. Barton was visiting the couple's daughters and would not leave the house, Ms. Barton stayed with Ms. Howard. That prompted Mr. Taylor's partner, David M. Conner, to say he was about to do something lawyers are not supposed to do, ask a question that they do not know the answer to. He asked Ms. Howard, ''Are you saying John caused Terry to set this fire?'' ''Indirectly, I am, yes,'' Ms. Howard said. The hearing was held as 19 major fires were burning across the United States, including a fast-moving blaze in eastern Arizona that has burned 60,000 acres. In Colorado, the fire Ms. Barton is accused of setting slowed a bit because of cooler temperatures, but two other large fires continued to burn in the southwestern part of the state, one that has grown to 54,000 acres, the other to 6,000 acres. Correction: June 24, 2002, Monday An article on Friday about a court hearing for Terry Lynn Barton, who is accused of having set a wildfire in Colorado, misstated the surname of her lawyer. He is Warren Williamson, not Williams."
"Three teenagers who illegally lighted a campfire in a tinder-dry state park were charged today with accidentally starting a blaze that destroyed more than 1,300 acres of pineland near the Jersey Shore this month. The blaze, which began in a cranberry bog in Berkeley Township on June 2 and burned for five days, destroyed three homes, singed 10 others and led to the evacuation of 500 residents. It also forced the closing of a 24-mile stretch of the Garden State Parkway for 16 hours. The authorities have estimated damage at as much as $1 million. At a news conference here today, the Ocean County prosecutor, Thomas F. Kelaher, said that the fire -- the biggest in the dense woods along the central New Jersey coastline for years -- began when campers failed to properly extinguish the smoldering campfire that they left behind after a nighttime birthday party. The three people charged are Christopher Walters, 19, and James Marshall, 18, both of Beachwood, N.J., and a 17-year-old. ''The people who were involved built a campfire despite the fact that there was a restriction on campfires because of the drought conditions that have been well known throughout the state,'' Mr. Kelaher said. The group of campers, which numbered as many as 35, arrived at the Double Trouble State Park on June 1 and stayed overnight, Mr. Kelaher said. They left the campsite around 11 a.m. the next day. ''And by 1 o'clock, a couple of hours later, the fire jumped out of the confines of the campfire site itself and set the woods on fire,'' he said. Mr. Walters, who says the group put the fire out before leaving, faces a third-degree charge of recklessly placing a forest in danger and two fourth-degree counts of criminal mischief for forcing the closing of the parkway and the destruction of a state vehicle in the fire. Mr. Marshall also faces two criminal mischief counts. The third teenager, whom the authorities would not identify because of his age, faces a juvenile delinquency complaint on criminal mischief charges. The 17-year-old, whose birthday the campers had been celebrating, also faces a delinquency complaint of threatening to harm a girl who, Mr. Kelaher said, he mistakenly believed had told the authorities about his involvement in the fire. Although the third-degree charges carry maximum penalties of five years in prison, none of the three are expected to serve time in jail, prosecutors said. All have been released pending court appearances. Interviewed at his home today, Mr. Walters said he and his fellow campers had made sure that the fire was extinguished. ''When we left all that was there was a little steam, but I'm sure it was out,'' he said. He said his mother had checked with the authorities and was told there were no prohibitions against camping in the park. So the group assumed it was permissible to light a fire, he said. As he watched news reports about the blaze on television, Mr. Walters said, he never considered that the fire could have been his fault. ''I had no idea it was us; I don't understand how it could be,'' he said. ''We have been camping before, and we know how to properly put out a fire.'' Not far from where he spoke, attached to a tree was a sign that he bought a few years ago, reading, ''Report forest fire to the warden by phone -- signed, the State of New Jersey.'' On Grand Central Parkway in Berkeley Township, the scene of a furious effort by firefighters the day the blaze began, the street was lined today with handmade signs that read, ''Thank you, firemen, you saved our homes.'' Throughout the neighborhood, patches of green peeked through a layer of charred grass and blackened stumps. Residents here said they hoped that today's charges would deter reckless campers. ''Carelessness,'' said Cheryl Carsten, who lost a backyard shed to the fire, when told of the charges. ''Look at what they did by not thinking. So many people almost lost everything. I still don't know how they saved what they did.''"
"Slowly, words and images are coming back from the fire's vengeance. Through video taken by work crews and property assessments by county officials, a more complete picture of the devastation is emerging. Some of it is staggering. Thousands of people evacuated from the region have not yet been allowed to return to their homes, and today, many of them sat clustered around television sets at shelters and high school gymnasiums, riveted by the scenes of utter destruction. Inside the 375,000 acres burned by the Rodeo-Chediski fire, the largest in Arizona history and growing still, video showed obliterated houses, scorched vehicles and naked sticks that once were trees. But even with the new trickle of information, no one knew for sure what may -- or may not -- await them back home. ''The uncertainty drives you nuts,'' said Charmaine McGlory, who lives with her husband in Overgaard. ''We're just a little dot on the map. Our house may be there or may not. But I'd rather know so I can prepare now what to do.'' President Bush surveyed the fires by air today, then greeted evacuees at a shelter in Eagar, Ariz., promising federal aid through a declaration of Apache and Navaho Counties as disaster areas. Mr. Bush called the fires ''a devastating disaster,'' and told the audience, ''Whatever we can do to help we'd really like to do.'' ''I want you to know that a lot of people in our country are pulling for you,'' he said. ''They understand the suffering that families are going through because of worry about your most precious possession, your home. They understand that a lot of you are living in tents when you'd rather be in your own bed. They cry for you, and they hurt for you.'' As Mr. Bush waved to people and shook hands, firefighters faced new challenges in efforts to get even the first percent of the blaze under control. After fire lines held overnight to protect Show Low, the largest population center in the area, fires swept through the small town of Heber, 35 miles to the west, burning down 15 more houses and threatening a major power line west of there. In addition, fire fighters still had concerns about Show Low, where the command center is situated. Flames were moving toward Highway 60, the main route to town from the southwest, throwing off embers that threatened houses in the area. ''If the fire crosses Highway 60, there's a chance it could turn into a wall of fire headed for Show Low,'' said Chadeen Palmer, a command spokeswoman who put the odds at 50-50 that it could happen. ''We're clearing brush from homes and businesses to make them safe in case the fire does move in.'' ''We're breathing a little easier today,'' she added, ''but the danger remains.'' Dick Fleishman, a firefighter with the Forest Service, worried that the region's topography could funnel the blaze toward the town. ''If you get into any of these canyons that have a southeast direction, it could shoot right into the south side of town,'' Mr. Fleishman said. Each day, fire officials try to create a numerical profile of the fire, which began a week ago, updating the numbers of firefighters and acres burned. Today's rundown included an estimate that close to 400 houses have been destroyed, and for the first time, residents of three communities in the fire path west of Show Low -- Clay Springs, Pinedale and Linden -- were given a telephone number to call to learn if their houses are still standing. The information was developed by county appraisers who have begun returning to areas burned for a close-up assessment. Today, they worked an area farther to the west, the towns of Heber and Overgaard. Since the evacuations began last week, residents of areas overtaken by the fires have scattered to small safe havens like Holbrook, where they wait to learn what, if anything, remains of their former lives. Inside shelters run by the Red Cross, like one here at the local high school and others in Eagar and Payson, they lie on cots, play games, watch television and chat. They find things to laugh about, and they cry a lot, too, but most of all, they are just waiting. ''You see all sorts of emotion,'' said Robin Arendt, a Red Cross volunteer from Oskaloosa, Iowa, who spent seven weeks in New York, helping after the terrorist attacks. ''When there's a disaster, the emotions always run the gamut.'' The Red Cross is accommodating thousands of the evacuees, including members of the Sweazy family from Heber, one of the first areas hit the fire. Four of the Sweazys gained housing at the high school here. The fifth, Charlie Jr., is living in the raggedy pickup truck that brought the family and two dogs down from the mountain. Mr. Sweazy has to stay with the dogs because they are too ornery, he said, to mix with other animals in the temporary kennel. They sleep under the truck. Until last week, Mr. Sweazy, 30, his parents and his sister's two young girls had lived in the dense woods above Heber in side-by-side trailers since the family moved from Oklahoma three years ago. His father has heart and respiratory problems, and the dry air suited him. They were planning to build a house to replace the trailers when they saved a little money. That was then. ''Not sure now what we're going to do now,'' Mr. Sweazy said from inside the truck, which was pretty steamy in the afternoon sun. ''Probably go back to Oklahoma. We got family there, and I'd rather deal with floods than fire. At least after floods, you got something standing.'' ''This was the first property we ever had that was bought and paid for,'' he said. ''Ten acres. Lots of trees. Closest neighbor a mile, mile-and-a-half away. So peaceful. But if the trees are gone, no use in staying. I imagine we'll just leave.'' Like other evacuees, he seemed more weary than angry. Daniel Marian, a roofing contractor from Overgaard, sat with a few friends in the high school cafeteria and even managed a corny joke. He said after the evacuation order came, he managed to get his 2 horses, 2 dogs, 1 rabbit and 1 cat to safety but not his 40 chickens and 2 quails. That much was true, he said, getting to the punch line in which he referred to the fire retardant dropped onto houses and trees, ''The slurry made a special barbeque sauce for the chicken.'' Mrs. McGlory, of Overgaard, said she was not sure what to think. Their A-frame home is all wood and surrounded by old ponderosa pine trees. Yet she has called the house several times and heard the answering machine respond. ''That means there's power,'' she said, ''but I don't have any real hopes for the house.'' It could be quite some time before most residents learn the fate of their property. Gilbert Gonzales, human resources director for Navajo County, said the appraisers were only returning to areas where it was safe to walk about. That makes it a painstaking process that could continue for days, if not weeks. ''It's quick, down and dirty,'' Mr. Gonzales said of the work. ''There's still a lot of fire spotting, and we don't want to put people in areas of danger. They can only pick and choose where to go.'' That means even the information available from special phone lines is sketchy, and that means more waiting for evacuees whose future seemed at once defined by two ends of the gymnasium here, where cots filled half the floor. At one end was a chalk board, with the message that said residents of Heber and Overgaard ''will not be able to return for at least 8 to 10 days.'' At the other end was a pair of television sets."
"IN the name of science, the United States Forest Service has proposed the experimental logging of half a million acres in two forests in the Sierra Nevada to see how it will affect the habitat of the California spotted owl and the ferocity of forest fires. But skeptical environmentalists are saying the real purpose is simply to give timber companies a chance to cut more big trees on some of the nation's 190 million acres of public land. The study is to be conducted in the Plumas and Lassen National Forests, two of the 11 national forests that run along the mountainous spine of California. The Bush administration's experiment is designed on such a grand scale that it will vastly increase the amount of timber being taken from the two northern California forests, which have been heavily logged in the past. Some trees to be cut are much larger than current forest regulations would allow: in some cases, up to 34 inches in diameter, or almost nine feet in girth. After a year in which forest fires raged through the West, affecting seven million acres, the administration has been pushing plans to thin the trees in places where years of mismanagement -- including the practice of putting out every single fire -- have left dense thickets of undergrowth. Often these projects are aimed at protecting small communities at the forest edge. But rarely do they involve cutting so many trees, or such big ones, especially in sensitive wildlife habitat deeper in the woods. In its announcement of the project, the Forest Service referred to the logging euphemistically as ''management-caused changes in vegetation,'' and said the study would test whether the benefits of the cleared areas, which would create firebreaks, exceed the ecological damage, especially to the spotted owl habitat. Like the more famous northern spotted owl of the Pacific Northwest, the California species is struggling for survival. Environmental advocates who have long fought logging in the region, and some scientists, see this proposal as science on the model of Japanese whalers, who take their harpoons to sea in what they call a research project -- one that happens to put whale meat on the menus of pricey restaurants in Tokyo. ''This comes to almost 30,000 acres per year of suitable owl habitat that would be logged,'' said Chad Hanson, an anti-logging advocate at the John Muir Project and a Sierra Club board member. The conservation groups say the plan is an attempt to reverse existing rules, including those adopted during the Clinton administration, that put much of the forest off limits. As evidence they pointed to the administration's announcement last week of changes in rules governing logging -- changes that the government said were aimed at limiting forest fires. The administration's goal was to cut through environmental reviews, court appeals and litigation that slow approval of the projects. Mark Rey, the assistant secretary of agriculture who oversees the Forest Service, said adversaries in the debates should learn to trust each other and the government. ''I certainly trust the environmental groups,'' said Mr. Rey, who was formerly a lobbyist for a forest industry group. ''They've spent millions of dollars on political ads to demonize the administration, but that doesn't mean I don't trust them.'' He spoke with tongue firmly in cheek, knowing that environmental groups are certain to challenge the administration's proposals in court. In fact, there was a big ruling last week on a related issue, when a federal appeals court in San Francisco decided to reinstate a ban on building roads in 60 million acres of national forest. The policy, put in place under President Clinton and challenged by the industry and some local governments, is one that the Bush administration wants to change. Road construction is one problem that environmentalists see in the California experiment. Another is the reduction in canopy cover in some California forests to 40 to 50 percent, compared with 60 to even 90 percent before logging -- a result that is prohibited under the current forest plan because of the likely harm to owls. Limits on cutting large trees, on building roads and on thinning the canopy were put into the regulations for the region after intensive scientific study. The Forest Service, however, said it would amend those rules, calling the changes insignificant. ENVIRONMENTALISTS are sure to object during the 45 days of public comment that began last week. ''I think this is quickly going to spiral into a device for getting around other restrictions on forest practices, under the guise of scientific analysis,'' said Don Erman, emeritus professor of forestry at the University of California at Davis. While the scientific question of how different methods of logging affect the survival of animals and the health of the forest is perfectly valid, he said, it remains to be seen whether the experiment needs to be so huge, or indeed whether its design is appropriate. These are matters that scientists, not timber lobbyists or environmentalists, should decide, he said, adding, ''I don't think science works very well from ideology.''"
"Round up the usual suspects! George W. Bush's new ''Healthy Forests'' plan reads like a parody of his administration's standard operating procedure. You see, environmentalists cause forest fires, and those nice corporations will solve the problem if we get out of their way. Am I being too harsh? No, actually it's even worse than it seems. ''Healthy Forests'' isn't just about scrapping environmental protection; it's also about expanding corporate welfare. Everyone agrees that the forests' prime evil is a well-meaning but counterproductive bear named Smokey. Generations of fire suppression have led to a dangerous accumulation of highly flammable small trees and underbrush. And in some -- not all -- of the national forests it's too late simply to reverse the policy; thanks to growing population and urban sprawl, some forests are too close to built-up areas to be allowed to burn. Clearly, some of the excess fuel in some of the nation's forests should be removed. But how? Mr. Bush asserts that there is a free lunch: allowing more logging that thins out the national forests will both yield valuable resources and reduce fire risks. But it turns out that the stuff that needs to be removed -- small trees and bushes, in areas close to habitation -- is of little commercial value. The good stuff, from the industry's point of view, consists of large, mature trees -- the kind of trees that usually survive forest fires -- which are often far from inhabited areas. So the administration proposes to make deals with logging companies: in return for clearing out the stuff that should be removed, they will be granted the right to take out other stuff that probably shouldn't be removed. Notice that this means that there isn't a free lunch after all. And there are at least three severe further problems with this plan. First, will the quid pro quo really be enforced, or will loggers simply make off with the quid and forget about the quo? The Forest Service, which would be in charge of enforcement, has repeatedly been cited by Congress's General Accounting Office for poor management and lack of accountability. And the agency, true to Bush administration form, is now run by a former industry lobbyist. (In the 2000 election cycle, the forest products industry gave 82 percent of its contributions to Republicans.) You don't have to be much of a cynic to question whether loggers will really be held to their promises. Second, linking logging of mature trees to clearing of underbrush is a policy non sequitur. Suppose Mayor Mike Bloomberg announced that Waste Management Inc. would pick up Manhattan's trash free, in return for the right to dump toxic waste on Staten Island. Staten Island residents would protest, correctly, that if Manhattan wants its garbage picked up, it should pay for the service; if the city wants to sell companies the right to dump elsewhere, that should be treated as a separate issue. Similarly, if the federal government wants to clear underbrush near populated areas, it should pay for it; if it wants to sell the right to log mature trees elsewhere, that should be a separate decision. And this gets us to the last point: In fact, the government doesn't make money when it sells timber rights to loggers. According to the General Accounting Office, the Forest Service consistently spends more money arranging timber sales than it actually gets from the sales. How much money? Funny you should ask: last year the Bush administration stopped releasing that information. In any case, the measured costs of timber sales capture only a fraction of the true budgetary costs of logging in the national forests, which is supported by hundreds of millions of dollars in federal subsidies, especially for road-building. This means that, environmental issues aside, inducing logging companies to clear underbrush by letting them log elsewhere would probably end up costing taxpayers more, not less, than dealing with the problem directly. So as in the case of the administration's energy policy, beneath the free-market rhetoric is a plan for increased subsidies to favored corporations. Surprise. A final thought: Wouldn't it be nice if just once, on some issue, the Bush administration came up with a plan that didn't involve weakened environmental protection, financial breaks for wealthy individuals and corporations and reduced public oversight?

"Every summer, we put thousands of young men and women in peril fighting forest fires in the West. This week they are putting their lives at risk in the pinelands of Idaho and Utah, in the chaparral of southern California and in the spruce-fir big woods of the Pacific Northwest. Helicopters and air tankers hover close to the flames. Some of these aircraft -- many older than the people flying them -- have suffered mechanical failure, and their crews have died. Yet we, the public and the government, continue to show moral failure -- failing to put people, not property, first, refusing to face up to the long-term causes of wildfires that put so many people in danger, especially those we send to fight them. Instead, fire by fire, we look for scapegoats -- whether it's a woman who said she set a letter ablaze or a maniac with a kerosene can or a fire-crew manager whose backfire in a controlled burn was swept uphill by a sudden gust. We have insisted upon developing property that invites wildfire. Over the decades, our policies have encouraged more people to move into fire-prone canyons and brushlands. Through home insurance, power-line placement, road construction, land-tax policies and the absence of fire-conscious local zoning laws, incentives have been created to put buildings and firefighters in harm's way. Natural fires will always strike, but we have to stop increasing the numbers of people threatened by these fires. Summer after summer, our political leaders -- at both the federal and local levels -- fail to offer large-scale, long-term solutions. Instead, they join the quest for individual villains and offer nostrums about privatizing the work of reducing ''fire load'' -- all forms of woody, burnable fuel -- as if a return to the practices of the 19th century would address land-use and development patterns that have made wildfires so dangerous and costly. The killer fires in our history started on private land, and the worst of these disasters came amid the slash and dry tinder left by commercial lumbering. Slash fires in the 19th century killed 1,500 people in the Peshtigo fire in Michigan and Wisconsin and 400 around Hinckley, Minn. Eighty people died in the great Montana fire of 1910. There was scarcely an acre of the fire zone visited by President Bush in Arizona in June that had not been cut for timber at least once. The nice big trees that lumber companies want are not the problem. Brush is the problem, and slash from logging. Real remedies, of course, will cost money up front and be preventive -- never an easy sell with the public. We will have to pay people to get out of harm's way. Meanwhile, we should stop subsidizing and encouraging new people to settle in fire zones. And we should enroll an army of young people to restore health to our fire-prone landscape by thinning small trees, cutting and removing brush, initiating controlled burning and restoring grasslands. We'll eventually come to this as Western communities face ever greater threats to life from fire. Why not do it now? Roger Kennedy is former director of the National Park Service and director emeritus of the National Museum of American History."
"Stepping through the blackened cinders left by one of the worst forest fires in Oregon's history, President Bush asserted today that his proposal to allow more logging in national forests would prevent catastrophic blazes and lift local economies. Mr. Bush denounced critics who described his plan as a giveaway for the timber industry. ''What the critics need to do is come and see firsthand the effect of bad forest policy,'' Mr. Bush said as he walked through a charred stand of Douglas fir and ponderosa pine on Squires Peak, trailed by a clutch of cameras and reporters. ''That's what they need to come and see.'' ''And by the way, there's nothing wrong with people being able to earn a living off of effective forest management,'' Mr. Bush continued. ''There are a lot of people in this part of the state who can't find work.'' Mr. Bush flew here this morning from his ranch in Texas for an evocative backdrop to press his proposal to allow more logging of national forestland. He said his plan would remove small trees that have contributed to one of the worst forest fire seasons in the nation's history. Air Force One flew low and slowly over the Biscuit fire, which started on July 27 and quickly became the largest fire in the state's history at 471,000 acres, banking to starboard to give Mr. Bush a view. Once on the ground, Mr. Bush took his motorcade on a slow, winding drive on mountain roads to the top of the 3,200-foot mountain. He stepped out for a carefully arranged tour through the woods, stopping twice to strip a swatch of blackened bark off a Douglas fir, and listening as Ron Wenker, the Medford district manager for the Bureau of Land Management, described the devastation of this fire season. ''We're trying to bring a little common sense to forest policy,'' Mr. Bush said to two firefighters pouring dirt on a smoldering clump of ground. Mr. Bush outlined several means intended to encourage the thinning of national forests by the timber industry. He said they would result in the needed removal of excess trees and brush at little cost to the government, while providing jobs to the timber industry. Among the measures Mr. Bush and his aides pushed were restrictions on litigation that environmental groups have used here to try to slow such efforts to remove some trees. ''The procedural requirements of our environmental laws are not supposed to wreak environmental havoc, and that's what some of them are doing,'' said James L. Connaughton, the chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality. The proposal was denounced today by Democratic Congressional leaders and the Sierra Club, as well as other environmental groups, which described it as a backdoor means to provide the timber industry access to national forestland. The tour was arranged to place Mr. Bush in two contrasting environments, on each side of a dirt road here. The first was where there had been no thinning of the forest; the stand of trees there was destroyed. In a second setting, there had been some thinning of trees and removal of underbrush, and the damage of the fire was much more limited. ''It's pretty clear that this fire prevention strategy of our country has been short-sighted and we, frankly, haven't done a very good job,'' Mr. Bush said after his tour. He added, ''We haven't had a strategy to clear the forest floor of built-up brush and densely packed trees that we have seen firsthand here and in other places around the country create the fuel, the kindling for extremely large fires, like those we're experiencing this year.'' Mr. Bush took pains today to portray the proposal in environmental and economic terms, as he tried to balance the conflicting pressures that have settled around the issue. On the environment, he noted that these fires tended to destroy the oldest trees and habitats used by endangered species. ''The hands-off policies that have contributed to this environmental crisis have been well intentioned, no question about that,'' he said. But, he added, ''they're dangerous.'' Mr. Bush also made it clear that he viewed the proposal as a way to help the local economy. ''One of the goals is prevent fire, healthy forests,'' he said. ''Another goal will be to provide jobs.'' As is his custom, Mr. Bush mixed in a bit of campaigning by appearing at a fund-raiser this evening for Senator Gordon Smith, a Republican. Mr. Bush was greeted in Portland tonight by hundreds of protesters outside his hotel protesting his talk of an Iraq invasion and his environmental policies. It was one of the largest groups of demonstrators Mr. Bush has encountered since Sept. 11."
"President Bush will ask Congress to relax environmental laws so the timber industry can step up logging across millions of acres of national forest land increasingly prone to devastating wildfires, senior administration officials said today. The plan is to be made public on Thursday, when Mr. Bush travels to southern Oregon. But after published reports today on the general thrust of the decision, environmentalists and some Democrats quickly condemned what they called a White House effort to promote rejuvenated logging in the name of fire prevention. With two of the last three summers having been among the worst fire years on record, Congress has already thrown its support and hundreds of millions of dollars behind a plan to remove more brush, small trees and undergrowth from public lands to make them less susceptible to blazes. But with support from Western Republican governors and senators, Mr. Bush now appears to want to go further. As described by Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton and other administration and Congressional officials, Mr. Bush would give loggers greater leeway to cut larger, more commercially valuable trees as well as worthless brush, and would deny environmentalists legal tools they have used to block such logging. ''The idea is to expedite the process and not to have the much-needed treatment process delayed,'' a senior administration official said. In particular, the officials said, Mr. Bush is likely to ask Congress to waive provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, which dates from 1970, to streamline approval of what proponents call a necessary forest thinning. ''With dense forests and severe drought, much of the West is a tinderbox waiting for a spark,'' Ms. Norton said in an article that appeared today on the op-ed page of USA Today and offered a preview of the Bush plan. The plan was also described today in The Los Angeles Times. Already this summer, the fires in the West have burned an area larger than Connecticut and Rhode Island combined. Out of 470 million acres of federally managed forests, some 190 million acres are now considered at risk of catastrophic fire. In recent weeks, Democrats and Republicans have become increasingly outspoken in calling for more aggressive efforts at thinning forests. ''Without active management, we will be asking ourselves in a few short years where our forests have gone,'' 15 Western senators, including Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, and Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho, warned earlier this month in a statement. Still, no consensus exists about how much thinning makes sense. In general, environmental leaders have advocated limited efforts, aimed at small trees and brush near homes and populated areas. They argue that since tinder-dry underbrush and saplings are what fuel fires, it makes no sense to cut the less-fire-prone big trees deep in the forests. The timber industry has recommended something far reaching, extending deep into wildlands and including large trees as well as small ones, to make the operations more commercially viable. In their previews today of Mr. Bush's plan, administration officials used language that most reflected the industry view, with references to cost-effectiveness, to managing forest ecosystems and to the importance, as Ms. Norton put it, of ''regulatory changes to produce faster decisions on forest-thinning projects.'' The indication that Mr. Bush would ask Congress to ease existing laws in the name of fire-protection angered environmental leaders. Allen Mattison, a spokesman for the Sierra Club, warned that Mr. Bush's plan might ''open the door to runaway logging'' in areas that are now protected. In response, administration officials said the White House plan would maintain strong safeguards, including prohibitions on the logging of old-growth forests. They said whatever new logging it permitted would be intended to produce safer, more fire-resistant forests. Administration officials and some lawmakers have complained that the National Environmental Policy Act, which governs how the federal government must assess forest management plans, allows cases to be tied up in court for years. In June, the head of the Forest Service told Congress that the agency spent about 40 percent of its time collecting documents and overseeing planning reviews, leaving it unable to properly manage the 192 million acres of forest it oversees. Environmental leaders have vigorously defended the safeguards, saying they are vital to prevent logging from running amok. But their position may have been weakened by a precedent set this year by Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota and the majority leader. Mr. Daschle inserted language into an emergency bill that allowed for bypassing the federal law to speed a forest-thinning program in his home state. Mr. Daschle has said he acted only after environmentalists and timber industry leaders in South Dakota agreed to a compromise on the issue. Still, Republicans, including Senator Craig, have suggested that the White House proposal might well mimic the exception that Senator Daschle won for his home state. Through a spokesman, Senator Craig, the ranking minority member on the Senate forest subcommittee, praised the administration for ''trying to cut some of the red tape as we try to get a handle on forest management in this country.'' By contrast, Representative Jay Inslee of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the House forest subcommittee, said the Forest Service and the administration should worry more about focusing its thinning programs on areas ''where they do the most good, which is to protect human life and property.'' ''They're interested not so much in streamlining the process,'' Mr. Inslee said in a telephone interview, ''but in streamlining the ability of their special-interest friends to take a national asset and turn it into private profit.'' Senator Feinstein said today that she would not comment on Mr. Bush's plan until it was made public. But a spokesman said she ''does feel that we need to move more aggressively to protect our forests, and one of the problems has been the extended process we need to go through in order to thin and do other projects that would deal with the tremendous overgrowth we now have.'' A model for the White House plan emerged as part of a deal reached this spring between the administration and two Western governors, Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho, a Republican, and John Kitzhaber of Oregon, a Democrat. Those talks, brokered by Ms. Norton and Ann M. Veneman, the agriculture secretary, produced a 10-year plan for the thinning of forest lands considered a particularly high fire risk, and they called for regulatory changes to produce faster decisions on high-priority projects."
"The bees came inside my house this summer and stayed, as if there would be water here, or relief from the endless sun. They huddled together against the window glass, a living hive, and not even Bruce Springsteen's ''The Rising'' displaced them, not even the slow drawl of ''To Kill a Mockingbird,'' which I read out loud to my son on the couch beneath the beehive. The bees came and they lived with us, and they endured, as we did, the heat, the blinding stifle of dust outside, the premature exhaustion of the trees beyond the glass. It was the summer of disbelief, also of despair. It was the summer of missing children and forest fires, of pretty girls with bombs on their backs, of a few men's greed and a market's sloppy tumble, of Martha Stewart and Ashleigh Banfield. It was the summer of menace in the headlines and faith under siege and the creep of tensions among citizens who began to argue about peace -- and this is why we finally went away to a lake resort in a mountain town (words that conjured, at least for me, green and blue and trails between trees, a crust of stars, a waterfall, an icy ice-cream parlor). Two nights, three days. Four hours, not far. Visions in my head of a reprieve, for I had stopped sleeping because of the heat, I had stopped holding out on behalf of the bees, who refused to consider a life beyond their own useless huddle. Imagination, like most other things, had dried to a husk and withered, and so we drove, my husband, son and I, in the company of Counting Crows, Marc Cohn, and then Beth Orton, and by the time Josh Groban and The Corrs were singing ''Canto Alla Vita,'' we were on the highway and counting down the exits. This is where I should confess that I'm a middle-aged romantic. This is where I should say that, after all these years, I still believe in kissing my husband as if each kiss were a first and a danger, and I still cry over butterflies, and I'm still in awe of how the four o'clocks deliver their own seeds. I am still, in other words, a bit of a grown-up spoiler when the exit yields not the ice-cream parlor but more dust, more heat, a cluster of bungalows, vacated stores, an empty theater. Still, I hoped. Still I thought there would be blue out near the lake. But the lake, when we got to the lake, was lake without beach, and the waterfall was bone-dry stones, and the trail around the lake was slappy, tick-y knee-high grass, and even the inn itself offered just breakfast and do-it-yourself-style lunch, which made us wonder, each to ourselves, what we would do for dinner. This was our escape, our summer vacation. We wouldn't hear about the fatal mauling of a baby by a bear in the Catskills until later. We wouldn't guess what was soon to happen, some 20 miles down the road, to a little girl at an outdoor picnic who napped inside her stroller beside a vacation bungalow; to the family, the close-knit Orthodox Jewish community she came from that had borne helpless, heartsick witness. We would, or I would, only congratulate ourselves for taking the ticks on, for shrugging at the bone-dry stones, for catching a bass, a pickerel, a sunfish, and a crappie, then catching the same fish again. We would only say, before we knew the next day's headline, that we had gotten away from the world at large, we had gone to where the news wouldn't dare to reach us.

"Thick, pungent smoke wafted over Los Angeles today, not from millions of exhaust pipes but from a ferocious wildfire in the San Gabriel Mountains that has consumed more than 9,000 acres of brush and trees. At least 44 structures, many of them weekend cabins, have been destroyed so far, and about 1,500 people evacuated. The fire, which began on Sunday afternoon of undetermined causes at Camp Williams in the Angeles National Forest, had an 11-mile southern flank today. It was threatening hillside neighborhoods in four towns on the periphery of the 691,000-acre forest: Azusa, Glendora, San Dimas and La Verne. To stop the fire's advance, 30 helicopters and air tankers and more than 2,000 firefighters -- including 60 so-called Type 1 strike teams, the most highly trained wild-land firefighters -- have been pressed into service. ''There's a lot of threat out there,'' said Battalion Chief Darren Drake, the fire marshal of San Luis Obispo and a member of a multi-agency command team gathered in a park near Irwindale, a few miles southwest of here. Chief Drake said the fire had ''slopped over'' a two-mile-long containment line built by bulldozers on Monday on the southeastern flank of the fire and was continuing an unabated march through sage and manzanita brush and stands of oak. The Williams fire was one of two large blazes raging in the searing heat of California's late summer, when temperatures of 100 degrees are common. In the Santa Cruz Mountains, a brush fire that began on Monday grew today to 1,600 acres, and threatened at least 50 homes. The 1,000 firefighters assigned to the blaze were hampered by dense smoke that kept air tankers grounded for most of the morning. A similar problem arose here in San Dimas, about 20 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, and adjoining towns, where the huge forest was obscured by so much smoke that, without potent winds to move it aloft, helicopters and fixed-wing water tankers were unable to carry out as many water drops as were wanted. A strong inversion layer confined the smoke to a 2,000-foot-thick layer over parts of Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. The intensity of the smoke sent pollution levels in the Los Angeles Basin soaring and prompted a public health warning from the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which was urging people to avoid unnecessary activity outdoors. In Glendora, a town that calls itself the Pride of the Foothills, the whipping flames were clearly visible on the hills to the north of Route 66, a thoroughfare renamed Alosta Avenue for a time before reverting to its original, legendary title. Dozens of fire engines with names of cities like San Diego, Simi Valley, Ventura and Oxnard painted on their sides lined the roads of suburban developments. ''Nothing like the smell of charred forest,'' said Rick Williams, a sales manager who was watching flames licking trees at the edge of the San Dimas Canyon Golf Course, where he often plays. Today, the greens were closed, but the staff was on hand to make sure the clubhouse did not go up in flames. Near the 10th, 11th and 12th holes, closest to the burning trees, sprinklers kept the ground wet. ''We're getting phone calls every other minute, practically, asking us if the course is O.K.,'' said Jeff Zeilenga, the club's tournament director. ''Our regulars seem to be concerned about it, which is comforting.'' On the fairway, three nervous deer roamed unfamiliar turf after running from the flames. Joe Fagerlind, the course superintendent, said three owls had also taken refuge from the fire, settling in a thicket of pine trees between the 11th and 14th holes. Most people who may have lost homes or weekend cabins could not find out for sure what had happened to their property. Philip Fornoth, who heads the radiology department at Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina, 14 miles west of here, and his wife, Cynthia, a radiographer in the same department, have owned a 1,000-square-foot cabin in San Dimas Canyon since 1975, and seemed resigned to its fate. Of the 78 cabins there, more than half are gone. ''That's the only thing that frightens me -- fire,'' Mrs. Fornoth said. ''With an earthquake, there's always something that you can salvage, but with a fire it's total devastation.''"
"GHOSTS OF THE FIREGROUND Echoes of the Great Peshtigo Fire and the Calling of a Wildland Firefighter. By Peter M. Leschak. 269 pp. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco. $24.95. FOR all the exceptional (and best-selling) disaster narratives since ''Into Thin Air'' and ''The Perfect Storm,'' few have taken on the monumental American fires of the past, and none -- including Sebastian Junger's ''Fire'' -- has delivered the world of wild-land firefighting as successfully as Norman Maclean's unfinished ''Young Men and Fire.'' In ''Ghosts of the Fireground,'' Peter M. Leschak attempts to do both, framing the Great Peshtigo Fire with his own long experience working fire lines in the West and Midwest. On Oct. 8, 1871, a giant forest fire engulfed the small lumber town of Peshtigo, Wis., and several other villages, killing an estimated 1,200 people and burning over a million acres. The catastrophe remains somewhat obscure, due partly to its remote location just west of the Green Bay, near Michigan's Upper Peninsula, but also because it happened the very same day as the Great Chicago Fire. Leschak is interested in the Peshtigo fire, but even more interested in a contemporary account of it written by a local Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Peter Pernin. While the special conditions that helped precipitate the blaze allow Leschak to educate the reader technically, Pernin's struggles in the midst of an apocalypse give him the chance to plumb his own lifelong quest for spirituality and to explain how he now sees the fireground as a sacred place. As a teenager in the 60's, taken with a radio preacher's view of the world, Leschak threw off his family's Catholicism and embraced a rigid fundamentalist sect, the Worldwide Church of God, attending its college in anticipation of joining the ministry. How he comes to repudiate that mind-set and find his own way is at the heart of the book as much as Peshtigo or the modern logistics of fire management. Fittingly, Leschak's approach is closer to Annie Dillard's than Norman Maclean's. Along with step-by-step descriptions of flight operations and dissections of leadership strategies in the field are mystical, sometimes New Age-like ruminations: ''There is mystery here -- the romantic attraction of hardship and hazard amid a corpulent society obsessed with mammon. I understand the flinty joy of acknowledging that I'd better serve and be served by my congregation (crew), because the world (fire) doesn't care about me at all, at all. I accepted the Assignment because of the welcome danger but also for the same reason I once matriculated at a Bible school -- to be a minister in a church. To scratch a line to salvation. To grasp the hot iron.'' Structurally, ''Ghosts of the Fireground'' bounces between following Father Pernin through Peshtigo and taking the reader along on the adventures of Leschak's crew during the busy summer of 2000, mixing in fire service history and glimpses of Leschak's spiritual journey as it goes, until the book has the loose feel of a personal essay or meditation. But as a narrative, the summer of 2000 never gets going, though trumpeted early on as another disaster waiting to happen; in pursuit of his own interests Leschak squanders whatever forward momentum the Peshtigo sections have. Worse, as if following a spontaneous turn of mind, Leschak continually interrupts the action (already in trouble) to fit in a supporting anecdote, which he then interrupts with yet another anecdote. Subjects arbitrarily pop up, occasionally aided by tortuous transitions. Every anecdote has its moral, and whenever possible, events are served up as metaphors. It's a shame Leschak decided to go the creative nonfiction route, because when he sticks with the basics of wild-land firefighting, he's good. As a veteran, he has fine insights into the attitudes of his comrades, and can clearly explain the gear, training and preparations for each mission, as well as the dangers. His descriptions of the care and skill necessary for basic helicopter operations are plainly stated yet fascinating. Father Pernin's situation is compelling and scenic, a wild nightmare. As the fire sweeps into Peshtigo, people fleeing and falling all around him, the priest digs a trench in which to bury his worldly valuables, then saves the parish tabernacle, placing it on a wagon and hauling it by himself to the river. Like most diarists, Pernin writes sympathetically about himself in the first person, yet throughout -- even after the fire -- he seems concerned more with his churches and his own health than with actively helping or comforting others. During the fire he risks his life for things, but never for his fellow townspeople. Father Pernin's journal entries account for only a small fraction of the Peshtigo sections. Leschak adds background and commentary, personal interpretations without which the reader might be excused for not considering the priest's actions heroic. While high-minded, they certainly weren't designed to save lives. As Robert W. Wells noted in ''Fire at Peshtigo'' (1968), as people fled in panic, Pernin asked them if they would help him haul his wagon. But what metaphor could an author make of such delusion? What moral would that story have? A larger problem here is the yoking of the summer of 2000 and the Peshtigo fire as if they were on the same scale. While Peshtigo is by far the more interesting thread, Leschak gives it less room, choosing instead to give us the buildup to several of his missions, heightening the sense of impending disaster as his crew slowly approaches the fireground. There are full pages devoted to transportation and equipment difficulties that ultimately mean little, events that should have been summarized if included at all. The missions in the back half of the book feel repetitious and unrewarding after so much ominous fanfare. In the end, ''Ghosts of the Fireground'' fails to deliver either the Peshtigo fire in full or a deeper view of the modern fireground, both of which would be valuable additions to the fire canon, and both of which Leschak appears eminently capable of writing. If there's anything that the gush of memoirs over the last 15 years should teach writers, it's that celebrating one's own fulfillment (no matter how hard won) smacks of self-satisfaction. Leschak's interest in his own spiritual growth far outstrips the reader's. His account, like Father Pernin's, is finally too self-centered to be helpful. Stewart O'Nan's new novel is ''Wish You Were Here.''"
"The woman who admitted to starting the largest wildfire in Colorado history apologized here today and was sentenced to six years in prison. The woman, Terry Lynn Barton, a Forest Service employee at the time of the fire, sobbed as she read a brief apology to the court. ''I'd like to say I was sorry. I'd like to get forgiveness, but I have not forgiven myself yet,'' she said. ''The fact that I have hurt so many people kills me each and every day because I do love people. I destroyed something I have cared for all of my life.'' In her plea agreement, Ms. Barton, 39, admitted to starting the wildfire in June when she burned a letter from her estranged husband while she was on patrol to impose a fire ban in Pike National Forest. She also acknowledged that she had initially lied to investigators. The Forest Service dismissed her after she was charged with starting the fire. David Connors, assistant United States attorney, said, ''We think the plea agreement demonstrates the tragedy, pain and suffering that one person can inflict in many different ways.'' Mr. Connors described Ms. Barton as the ''author of this tragedy,'' saying she had lied to investigators and tried to shift blame. The fire burned more than 137,000 acres southwest of Denver and about 133 homes. Ms. Barton has also pleaded guilty to state charges, and could be sentenced to up to 12 years in prison in March. Because her state sentence may be served concurrently with her federal sentence, the beginning of her sentence was stayed until March 24. The judge, Richard P. Matsch of Federal District Court, rejected a request by prosecutors that Ms. Barton be forced to pay restitution. ''I'm not going to sentence Ms. Barton to a life in poverty,'' Judge Matsch said as Ms. Barton's two teenage daughters looked on. For many people affected by the fire, no sentence or restitution is enough. ''The fire may be out, but the flames in people's hearts are still burning with anger at her,'' said Ginger Krabbenhoft, 64, of Florissant, Colo., who attended the hearing. ''She can apologize all she wants. But she's an adult, not a child and she affected many, many people's lives.''"
"LOOKING out on a stark winter landscape recently, I spotted a squirrel digging in the semifrozen soil. Before I could yell, ''Not my tulips!'' it unearthed an acorn and scampered off. Although glad that my bulbs had been spared, I was struck by another notion: The world has now been deprived of a tree. Inside that acorn was the seed of a mighty oak, one that might have lived 500 years. Indeed, depending on snow cover, soil conditions and the threat of seed snatchers, winter is a fine time to plant acorns. For hard-core gardeners with cabin fever, planting acorns in the dead of winter may be just what the doctor ordered. The first thing to remember is that most oaks eventually get huge, many reaching 80 to 100 feet tall and more than 50 feet across. Secondly, as relatively slow-growing trees, they should be given every encouragement possible, which means planting them in full sun and catering to their soil preferences. Oaks generally fall into two categories. Those with rounded leaf edges and nuts that germinate in the fall are considered white oaks. Red oaks have leaves with pointed lobes and produce acorns that only germinate after a cold period of 30 to 60 days in a process called stratification. Any acorn -- red or white -- can be planted now or in the spring. Avoid any that are still wearing their caps, as they are wormy or otherwise not viable. Planting acorns is easy. Using a dibble or trowel, dig a hole an inch and a half deep. Drop the acorn in, cover it with soil, pat it down and wait. If digging in frozen ground doesn't appeal to you or if the squirrels are watching your every move, acorns can be collected in winter, stratified in a refrigerator for 30 to 60 days, then planted in the spring. Store them in a paper bag in the vegetable drawer to keep them from drying out. By spring, the squirrels will have better fish to fry (like the tender shoots of my hostas). White oak acorns should already show rootlets. Red oak nuts may need help opening their shells if they have been stratified, or preserved indoors, because they do not go through multiple freeze and thaw cycles. Simply score the acorn with a knife or rub it with 80-grit sandpaper until the kernel is exposed. Not all acorns will germinate the first year, which makes sense from a Darwinian point of view: If a drought or a forest fire kills off some seedlings this year, others will be able to pop up the next. Each season I get a little more like the squirrels, which -- contrary to popular belief -- never remember where they put things. They find acorns by smell, but I depend on white plastic markers, which I'll poke in the ground like little mouse tombstones. (It's probably only a matter of time, of course, before the squirrels figure out what is buried beneath.) One of the best red oaks for suburban areas is the pin oak, Quercus palustris. It is smaller than many oaks (still, it grows to about 60 feet), with shallow fibrous roots that can thrive in the heavy clay often found in the disturbed soil of subdivisions. It prefers acidic soils, so it does well in the Northeast. Pin oaks grow more quickly than many oaks, often adding two feet of height or more per year, and they have a profile that is handsome year-round. Like all the oaks discussed here, they are hardy in zones 4 to 8 or 9. For yards with sandy loam, another red oak, Quercus rubra, is best. It, too, grows quickly, reaching perhaps 60 to 75 feet in 30 years and spreading nearly that wide. It too tolerates less than ideal conditions, gamely breathing polluted air. QUERCUS ALBA, a white oak, is majestic and can live 500 years or more, attaining heights of 100 feet. It does best in deep, moist, well-drained soils. It is susceptible to anthracnose and other diseases, but thrives in the wild from Maine to Florida and as far west as Minnesota and Texas. It is worth planting where space permits. The chestnut oak, Quercus prinus, has been known to live twice as long. It is handsome, with deeply furrowed bark and a nearly globe-shaped form that is striking in winter. It can survive in dry, rocky places that would be eschewed by other trees. My favorite example is a 40-year-old that sits on the Dartmouth College campus , is about 35 feet tall and wide , and inexplicably produces a heavy load of acorns only every five years. American Indians have eaten acorns for centuries, boiling or soaking them to get rid of a bitter tannic flavor and grinding them to make porridge. Sam Thayer, a wild-food educator in Bruce, Wis., sent me some red oak grits, which I boiled briefly in milk. They were tasty: nutty and not at all bitter, even better with a little maple syrup. If I plant some acorns this weekend, I may be able to harvest my own breakfast during some distant winter -- in, say, 15 to 20 years. More immediately, of course, I will have had a good excuse to get out of the house and poke around. CUTTINGS"
"In the summer of 2000, fires roared through the tinder-dry Bitterroot National Forest, cloaking the valley in dense smoke for weeks, blackening more than 300,000 acres and destroying 70 private homes in a valley that is a bedroom community for this university town. Now the restoration of the forest has become the focus of a dispute between environmental groups and the United States Forest Service. A coalition of local and national environmental groups say the agency is breaking a promise to move the restoration along quickly. The Forest Service acknowledges that the work has been delayed by budget shortages but insists that it will be completed in three to five years. An analysis by the environmental groups found that of 33,150 acres planned for reforestation, only 4,000 acres had been planted, and that watershed and road restoration was going even more slowly. The Forest Service has completed just 13 of 500 miles of road upgrades to accommodate increased timber hauling and prevent runoff from substandard roads. The agency has obliterated just half a mile of the 45 miles of roads planned for elimination. ''The Forest Service always says we have to trust them,'' said Robert Ekey, who, as Northern Rockies regional director for the Wilderness Society, was a party to negotiations last year that produced the agreement on restoration. ''This illustrates why we don't trust them. They always break their promise.'' Environmentalists also say the agency's three- to five-year time frame is too long. The longer the restoration work goes undone, some scientists say, the greater the effects on forest ecosystems -- especially to two species of trout, the west slope cutthroat and the federally protected bull trout. Heavy silt in streams can also suffocate fish eggs and kill adult fish by blocking their gills. ''Some of these roads are generating tremendous concentrations of runoff,'' said Dr. Chris Frissell, a fisheries biologist and watershed scientist with the Pacific Rivers Council, a conservation group. ''I've never seen streams muddier.'' The Forest Service replies that it is under severe budget constraints, largely as a result of last year's destructive wave of forest fires in other states. The fires cost the agency $1.2 billion, more than four times its annual firefighting budget. The agency shifted $919 million from other uses to fires, including $25.5 million for restoration on the Bitterroot. ''Those funds were withdrawn to protect life and property,'' said Spike Thompson, a deputy forest supervisor on the Bitterroot. ''We understand that.'' Congress's 2003 spending bill included just $636 million in reimbursement, so many restoration and research projects around the country will get less than planned. Officials also warn that another record fire season this year may mean even less money for such projects. The roots of the Bitterroot dispute can be traced to the three-way tug-of-war between environmentalists, the Forest Service and the timber industry. Environmentalists say one reason the Bitterroot is so carefully watched is that the forest has a long history of abuse, including years of clear-cutting and extensive networks of logging roads that have compromised many forest ecosystems. The year after the fires here, Bitterroot forest officials proposed to sell 41,000 acres of burned timber, equivalent to 10 years' worth of logging. Calling the sale and associated restoration a ''burned area recovery plan,'' they said removing dead trees was important to head off future fires. The environmentalists maintained that the burned area recovery plan was just an old-fashioned timber-salvage sale with a new spin. The Forest Service replied that forest health, including the removal of roads to prevent stream sedimentation, was first and foremost. ''It is imperative that we move forward with the project to help restore the land and prevent further environmental degradation,'' Dale Bosworth, the chief of the Forest Service, said last year. Timber companies said the longer the burned trees stood, the lower their value. When the Forest Service tried to hasten logging by shortcutting a public appeals process, environmental groups responded by filing a lawsuit. A federal judge ruled in the environmentalists' favor, forcing the two sides to talk. Last year, Chief Bosworth and Mark Rey, an under secretary of agriculture who is a former timber lobbyist, agreed to about 14,000 acres of timber cutting, down from the Forest Service's original proposal of 41,000 acres. Dr. Frissell, of the Pacific Rivers Council, says the logging has generally had minimal effect on streams. But Larry Campbell, a spokesman for another environmental group, Friends of the Bitterroot, said the salvage logging now taking place had cut far too many big trees, which the Forest Service said it would leave. ''Ecologically they are the most valuable,'' Mr. Campbell said. ''The only moisture available in a burned forest is inside these nurse logs'' -- the logs in which new trees and other plants establish themselves. Grasses have come back after the fire, but vast swaths of blackened trees that look like burned matches are still the most dominant feature of the forest in many places where the fires burned. The Forest Service acknowledged last month that it had accidentally allowed the cutting of 10 large trees that were important to shading a creek in the burned area. Rather than allow timber companies to take them, the agency ordered them left on the ground. The salvage sale, which started last summer and is still going on, is being conducted under a microscope. The Bitterroot is one of the state's most watched forests because it lies close to the ecologically minded town of Missoula. ''If they can't get it right on the Bitterroot, where everyone is watching and the chief and under secretary are involved,'' said Matthew Koehler, the director of the Native Forest Network, an environmental group critical of last year's negotiations, ''they can't get it right anywhere.''"
"The toll of the fires in the mountains east of San Diego was beginning to tell on Wednesday and could be seen in the blank, weary faces of countless firefighters, some of whom have been battling the raging flames for five days or more. ''In the state as a whole, there are so many fires that there's been no one to relieve anybody,'' Josh Heinbach, 26, an engineer with the California Department of Forestry, said as he rested for a moment by his engine just outside this small mountain town, where flames threatened from two directions on Wednesday afternoon. Fortunately, some crews have been rotated to fight the fires that descended on the parched forests and mountains of San Diego County, but many firefighters have worked far longer than usual and in conditions that are little short of hellish. As fresh crews arrive from elsewhere in California and beyond, the authorities have made a concerted effort to relieve the exhausted firefighters, one of whom was killed on Wednesday in a flare-up in Wynola just northwest of here. Almost 500 square miles have burned across the county, and only one of the area's four major fires the 46,000-acre Otay fire at the border with Mexico has been contained. The others rage on, displacing thousands of people, destroying wildlife and ruining vast tracts of once-bucolic mountains. Entire communities have disappeared. ''This fire is insane, just insane,'' said Rodney Hayball, 21, a firefighter with the California Department of Forestry who took part in the initial attack on the Cedar fire, late on Saturday, and has worked almost nonstop since then. ''It was just ripping through here. It was fast, that's for sure.'' Officials estimated that 200 houses had been consumed near Julian by Wednesday afternoon, and fires burned on the ridges within sight of the town's three-block-long Main Street. The thoroughfare was deserted but for more than a dozen fire engines and their crews, ready to pounce on wandering embers or any flames that might approach this mining town that sprang up from a gold rush in the Cuyamaca Mountains in the 1870's. ''We've got to make sure it doesn't take this place,'' Dan Middlebrooks, a captain with the Fire Department in Montebello, a city east of Los Angeles, who was assigned to the fire here three days ago. ''We haven't stopped it so far, and right now it's winning.'' He went on to say, ''We worked all night last night.'' Few of the almost 5,000 firefighters on duty in San Diego County will admit to fatigue. ''You get hyped up, and you want to help when there's a lot of fire,'' said Ray Marquez, an engineer with the Santa Fe Springs Fire Department in Los Angeles County, as he sat on a sidewalk bench here. ''You don't even think about being tired.'' But the look on Mr. Marquez's face told a different story. He admitted to having gotten four or five hours of sleep early Wednesday ''almost a vacation, relatively speaking'' after working since Saturday. As he spoke, he leaned his head on the wall behind him, occasionally closing his eyes. The question of whether firefighters are being overworked has become controversial in the area over the last couple of days, as residents who lost their homes debated whether enough was done to save them and whether a larger number of troops on the ground and tankers in the air might have made a difference. At the same time, some radio talk-show hosts in San Diego have whipped themselves into a fervor as they accused Gov. Gray Davis of taking too long to ask for federal firefighting reinforcements, particularly the large military air tankers, generally converted C-130 transport planes normally used to fight fires on military bases. Most fire officials are taking pains not to criticize the governor. ''There were political problems, and a lot of people were complaining, but those C-130's are slow, and if the smoke is too thick, you can't bring them into the mountains, because it's too dangerous,'' John Renshaw, a spokesman with the United States Forest Service, said Wednesday afternoon in Julian. Firefighters, too, preferred to stay out of politics. ''We don't worry about that,'' said David Osuna, chief of the Santa Ysabel fire station, a few miles northeast of Julian. ''That's for the uppity-ups. We're paid to do a job.'' Even so, Mr. Osuna said, he and his crew worked for about 36 consecutive hours beginning on Saturday morning. By Monday evening, help arrived. ''They brought in reinforcements because we'd been working too long,'' Mr. Osuna said. ''Sometimes you get a little break. You catnap here and there, waiting for the fire.'' THE CALIFORNIA FIRES: FIREFIGHTERS"
"The inhalation of tiny smoke particles from wildfires, while unpleasant, is unlikely to cause long-term damage to healthy people unless it occurs over a prolonged period, doctors and environmental health specialists said. But the experts also warned that young children, the elderly and anyone with chronic pulmonary or cardiovascular conditions could be at risk for complications, and those people were particularly advised to stay indoors and run their air-conditioners while the fires in Southern California continued to rage. Joe Tash, a spokesman at San Diego County's emergency operations center, said hospitals in the area had reported a significant rise in the number of people seeking treatment for respiratory problems, particularly among those with pre-existing lung-related ailments. Most patients have been treated and released rather than hospitalized, he said. At the University of California at San Diego Medical Center, a spokeswoman reported that earlier in the week the number of people visiting the emergency room for respiratory complaints had increased by 50 percent. A hospital-affiliated clinic down the street, she added, was seeing twice the usual number of patients with respiratory problems. The primary danger, experts say, arises from particles from vegetation and other burned matter that can lodge deep in the lungs and, in some cases, lead to severe shortness of breath, asthma attacks, bronchitis and other pulmonary ailments. The most damaging particles are invisible to the eye and can evade the body's normal protective mechanisms, like tiny hairs in the nostrils and cells within the lungs designed to expel or destroy alien substances. ''If you can see the particles, they're not going to hurt you, unless they land in your eye,'' said Dr. William Hughson, a professor of medicine at the University of California at San Diego and director of its Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine. The particles to be concerned about, Dr. Hughson said, are smaller than three microns in size, or three-thousandths of a millimeter. ''These particles can irritate your nose, your sinuses, your lungs,'' he said. ''If you're healthy and normal, those effects will go away after the air pollution clears out.'' Dick Smith, director of air pollution control for San Diego County, said all residents were being advised to stay indoors as much as possible, to curtail exercise and other activities that caused them to gulp in air and to drink plenty of fluids. Facial masks can help, he said, especially if they filter out tiny particles and fit tightly over the mouth and nose. Inhaled particles inflame the bronchial tubes and can cause them to constrict, a process that can be dangerous for anyone with asthma or other respiratory ailments, Mr. Smith said. They can also impede the function of the the tiny airways deep in the lungs where incoming oxygen is delivered to the blood. ''The particles can disrupt the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen, which then causes people to be short of breath, among other things,'' Mr. Smith said. Scientists say it can be hard to study the effects of forest fire smoke because such research depends on events in the natural world. Still, a few studies have borne out a relationship between forest fires and a rise in people seeking medical help. In forest fires, smoke particles are mainly made up of organic material from burning vegetation. That distinguishes them from the kinds of particles found in urban fires, like those associated with the attack on the World Trade Center two years ago. ''When buildings burn down, you can get some nasty things,'' Dr. Hughson said. ''An awful lot of the dust that came down with the towers was construction materials, a lot of concrete dust. That's very, very irritating, more toxic than this stuff from a forest fire.'' THE CALIFORNIA FIRES: HEALTH PROBLEMS"
"The raging California wildfires attacked the resort area of Lake Arrowhead east of Los Angeles and the historic gold-mining town of Julian in San Diego County on Wednesday, killing one firefighter and destroying hundreds more homes. The firefighter, whose name was not released, was killed near Julian when the wind suddenly changed direction and the fire jumped a highway and engulfed a fire truck. Three other firefighters were burned in the incident, one severely. It was the first firefighter death in a series of fires that have killed at least 17 other people. The wildfires, now in their ninth day, have consumed nearly 660,000 acres and destroyed more than 2,400 homes, the state Office of Emergency Services reported. Damage estimates exceed $2 billion, but that figure is expected to rise substantially as an inventory of firefighting costs and lost property is completed. The fires are now one of the deadliest and costliest disasters in California. And officials warn that the damage could become far worse, as shifting and gusting winds blow the fire toward huge stands of large pine trees killed by drought and a beetle infestation in the San Bernardino National Forest. The hot, dry Santa Ana winds have abated, but they have been replaced by winds from the coast that are driving the fire up the mountainsides into the damaged trees. Many mountain communities are surrounded by the fire-ready trees, waiting for an ill wind to carry an ember and touch off a conflagration. ''The fire when it gets started there will be of biblical proportions,'' said Andrea Tuttle, director of the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. ''It's going to be the most intense fire that we have ever seen.'' Wednesday afternoon, Gov. Gray Davis toured the Lake Arrowhead area, where more than 50,000 people have been evacuated and an untold number of homes have burned. The fire also reached the outskirts of the town of Hesperia, about 12 miles northwest of Lake Arrowhead, and was quickly moving toward Running Springs to the southwest. ''This has been a very tough day on the fire line,'' Ms. Tuttle said. The authorities had hoped cooler winds blowing off the ocean would help tame the fires. But the change brought only new challenges and more disaster. The National Weather Service issued a ''critical fire threat'' alert for the mountains and foothills of the region as the winds kicked up Wednesday afternoon. State and federal fire officials said the wind was pushing one fire up the canyons and across Highway 18, the main road through the Lake Arrowhead-Big Bear resort region, which firefighters had hoped to use as a break on the advancing flames. Crews brought in to cut down trees along the road were driven back by the heat. Tanker aircraft were grounded for much of the day by winds and intense smoke. ''We hoped to hold it at the highway, but with the winds behind it, you can't do too much with it,'' said Martin Esparza, a spokesman for the United States Forest Service. ''There's a lot of work to do, but the fire is just larger than what we can deal with.'' Mr. Esparza said most people had heeded orders to evacuate over the last two days, but he expected that some had remained behind to brave out the advancing firestorm. ''The only people up there are firefighters,'' Mr. Esparza said, ''and people who search and recovery will have to go back for later.'' The other major front was around Julian in central San Diego County. ''This town is under great threat,'' Bill Everett, a volunteer firefighter with the Julian Fire Department, said Wednesday afternoon, about an hour after he found out that his own home, in Kentwood, two miles east, had been reduced to ashes. As he spoke, helicopters rushed overhead, one after another, headed for the billowing smoke and flames just beyond the town's edge. Julian was also threatened from the northwest, where a wall of fire at least 50 feet high jumped across a winding mountain road and thundered up the hill, taking by surprise a group of firefighters, sheriff's deputies and journalists, forcing them to retreat rapidly. Officials estimated that about 200 houses had been destroyed around Julian, a mining town that retains much of its Old West character. The three-block-long center of town, 60 miles inland and at an elevation of more than 4,000 feet, remained intact Wednesday afternoon, guarded by a dozen fire engines and their crews, who parked along Main Street. Every business was closed, and all the residents had long since fled. But as of late Wednesday afternoon, the fire lines had largely held. The firefighter who was killed, and those who were injured, were in their truck about five miles outside of Julian when the wind shifted and they were overtaken by the flames, a San Diego sheriff's department spokesman said. The firefighter who died was on loan from the Novato Fire Department in Northern California. South of Julian, the lakeside town of Cuyamaca was almost wiped out late Tuesday. Only the fire station and city hall remained standing. Witnesses reported seeing charred cows lying by the side of the road and cottages reduced to heaps of ash. San Diego County fire officials feared that the Cedar Fire, which has burned more than 230,000 acres, would merge with the Paradise Fire, which has taken 50,000 acres. But a spokeswoman for the state firefighting agency said that the fires remained separated by about five miles and that crews had so far been successful in keeping them apart. Air quality monitoring stations in the central and northern part of San Diego County recorded ''very unhealthy to hazardous conditions'' because of the dense, eye-stinging smoke, officials said. California's governor-elect, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is expected to take office on Nov. 17, was in Washington on Wednesday to meet with members of Congress and the administration. He issued a plea for immediate assistance to help the victims of the fires and to cover the escalating cost of fighting them. ''We have to get help as soon as possible,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said at a news conference on Capitol Hill. ''I'm here basically to just work very hard to get more money to California so we can control this fire and also then rebuild the businesses and the homes.'' Officials suspect that several of the fires were deliberately set. The San Bernardino County sheriff is looking for a white man in his early to mid-20's who was seen leaving the origin of a fire Saturday, driving a light gray van. The county is offering a $50,000 award for information leading to the conviction of the person responsible for the fire. On Wednesday the Los Angeles County district attorney's office charged a 23-year-old Pasadena man, Dikran Armouchian, with arson in a blaze on Tuesday in the Los Angeles National Forest. It did not grow into a major fire. THE CALIFORNIA FIRES: THE OVERVIEW"
"As the fire roared down the mountain in a rush of embers, ash and blinding light, Terry Ritter's only weapon, a narrow garden hose, suddenly seemed crushingly inadequate. A few minutes later on Saturday night, when the wind-driven sparks ignited the roof of his garage, the battle for his home of 34 years was all but over. ''I tried to put it out, but the wind was blowing too hard,'' Mr. Ritter, 50, a carpenter, said on Sunday morning as he sifted through the smoking debris of what had been a three-bedroom house on Mesquite Drive. ''It just spread, man. It was nonstop.'' Similar scenes of heartbreak were repeated across San Bernardino and other communities in the foothills of the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountain ranges -- like La Verne, Claremont, Crestline and Rancho Cucamonga -- as residents assessed the damage from the wildfires that have struck, with devastating impact, since early last week. The authorities have said that arson is suspected in most of the fires. In San Bernardino alone, more than 300 buildings have been lost, a grim count that is likely to rise as the fire continues to rage. In the hot, smoke-filled afternoon on Sunday, hundreds of people who had been evacuated watched from the former Norton Air Force Base as red and white air tankers sped down the runway and lifted off, bound for the blazing mountains that many of those evacuated called home. Many of the fire-scarred neighborhoods were jammed on Sunday by processions of motorists eager to see the damage. They cruised the silent streets, gazing at the destruction and taking pictures. By midafternoon, police officers had blocked some of the streets with access to the most damaged areas, but a few of the curious still found their way into the neighborhoods. Most people, forced to flee as the fire bore down, had no idea whether their homes were still standing on Sunday, and feared the worst. ''We watched it come and we had to go,'' said Darcee Klapp, 42, who sat on a curb at the base surrounded by her seven children, their 12 dogs and two parakeets. ''Everybody knew it was coming. We didn't know how long we had because the winds were so erratic. We were looking to the west of us, and here came the fire from the east.'' Mrs. Klapp, who lives in Devore, a town about 15 miles northwest of here, said that the weather conditions had been ''absolutely atrocious.'' ''We haven't had rain in over a hundred days,'' said Mrs. Klapp, whose husband, Wilbur, is a firefighter in Devore. ''He is right now trying to protect our house of 15 years, and we don't know if we have a house or not.'' For others, their worst fears were realized once they were able to return to the ash-filled streets on which they had lived. ''It's all a loss,'' said Charles Baird, 26, a travel agent who was trying Sunday afternoon to salvage something -- anything -- from the wreckage of the home he rented on Alto Drive, in the Del Rosa neighborhood of San Bernardino, where he has lived all his life. ''I've had better days.'' On either side of his property and across the street, house after house was a smoking pile of rubble. On the remains of a chimney nearby, a legend had been scrawled, ''Scott and Val -- we'll be back.'' Mr. Baird, whose only insured possessions were the three cars, now destroyed, in his driveway, said he, too, had tried to save his home on Saturday afternoon with dismal results. ''We were wetting everything down,'' he said, ''But once the clouds got so thick it became like nighttime and we had to leave. I was choking and vomiting. I just had to go.'' In the confusion, his cat, Princess, vanished, although she reappeared on Sunday, evidently unharmed, as Mr. Baird and his mother, Suzanne, pored through the mess. A few houses away, on El Camino Drive, Marcey Stanton's home of 40 years was one of more then a dozen in a row that were lost to the flames. Her reaction, however, as friends stopped by to commiserate, was unfailingly positive. ''I'm fine,'' she said. ''You can't let it defeat you.'' Mrs. Stanton remained calm even when told that her mountain cabin in Cedar Pines Park, about 20 miles north of here, was very likely lost too. She said that she and her husband, Gerald, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and who she had removed from the house as the flames approached, would rebuild both homes. Mrs. Stanton even had a moment to comfort some neighborhood children who had begun to cry after seeing how upset their mothers were at the devastation of their homes. ''I put my arms around them and told them everything would be all right,'' she said. ''Their mothers were hysterical, and kids soak that up like a sponge.''"
"Crews battling raging wildfires in Southern California are up against nearly ideal conditions for the spread of flames. Meteorologists said on Sunday that tinderbox forests ravaged by drought and beetles make it easy for fires to start. And strong, hot winds are fanning the flames. Still, they said, this is far from a once-in-a-lifetime situation. The same weather conditions occur quite frequently here, so the fires this week are perhaps a result only of bad luck, or deliberate acts. The weather now provides ''the ideal conditions for fire: warm temperatures, dry air and lots of wind,'' said James K. Purpura, the meteorologist in charge of the San Diego office of the National Weather Service. But, Mr. Purpura added, ''it's not at all uncommon. We'll see it several times during a typical fall in Southern California.'' A major problem for firefighters are the Santa Ana winds: hot, dry gusts that come hurtling from the deserts of Nevada toward the Pacific Ocean. As they funnel through the narrow canyons and mountain passes east of Los Angeles, they speed up to 40 to 60 miles per hour. The winds bring temperatures in the 80's and 90's, about 5 to 10 degrees higher than normal, and relative humidity of 10 percent or below. The winds help spread the fire quickly along the ground. In addition, embers can be lifted skyward by the gusts and the heat of the flames and then blown downwind, starting new fires as much as a mile away. Eric R. Hilgendorf, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service office in Oxnard, Calif., about 45 miles northwest of Los Angeles, said, ''In a sense, the firefighters have to fight both the current line and they have to look downwind very far, a mile or more, trying to stay ahead of it.'' Still, Mr. Hilgendorf said, the current Santa Ana winds are in ''the moderate category at best.'' In a strong Santa Ana, he said, winds gust up to 80 miles per hour and temperatures reach 110 degrees. Even before the winds came, the risk of fire in Southern California was considered extremely high because several years of drought had left trees vulnerable to the bark beetle and other pests and diseases. Hundreds of thousands of trees are estimated to have died, making them easy to burn. Because of the bark beetle infestation, Gov. Gray Davis declared a state of emergency in March in San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, easing regulations to allow property owners in those Southern California areas to more quickly remove dead and dying trees. The United States secretary of agriculture, Ann M. Veneman, toured the San Bernardino National Forest in August and pledged an additional $5 million to be used to remove dead or stressed trees, thin overstocked stands and double firefighting resources with additional fire crews and equipment. Rainfall in Southern California has been close to normal this year, the National Weather Service says. The poor condition of the forest stems from very low rainfall in the few years before. The near-normal rainfall this year may have been a mixed blessing, Mr. Hilgendorf said. Though the rain may have reduced the fire risk somewhat, it also spurred greater growth of grasses, which serve as fuel for a fire once it starts advancing. The National Weather Service said on Sunday that the Santa Ana winds would begin to weaken by Monday afternoon, making conditions better for firefighting. By Wednesday, winds should be blowing inland from the ocean, Mr. Hilgendorf said. Those winds could be a mixed blessing, too, he said. While they will be cooler and more moist, and therefore help firefighters, Mr. Hilgendorf said there is also ''somewhat of a danger because now the winds will push the fire in a completely different direction.'' The meteorologists have suffered their own problems from the fires. In San Diego County, a Doppler radar, used to measure wind speed, appeared to have been knocked out of commission by one of the fires, though another radar was picking up the slack, said Mr. Purpura of the weather service. Even more worrisome, he said, a fire 15 miles away was heading toward the San Diego office, which is in the Rancho Bernardo area. ''We're a little nervous because we can see the smoke plume pointed right at us,'' Mr. Purpura said."
"Firestorms roared through parched forests and scrubland across Southern California on Sunday, jumping into residential areas and shrouding hundreds of square miles in pungent yellow-gray smoke. Tens of thousands of residents were forced to flee 10 rapidly spreading blazes from Simi Valley in Ventura County in the north to San Bernardino in the east and almost to the Mexican border in the south. Thousands of federal, state and local firefighters sought to contain the fires, with little success. State fire officials estimated Sunday afternoon that the fires covered more than 300,000 acres, with the area growing hourly. The fires have claimed at least 13 lives, including two people in San Diego County who were burned in their car as they fled, the police said. The fires contributed to a nationwide disruption of air traffic when a Federal Aviation Administration office in San Diego that handles air traffic for all of Southern California was shut down about 9 a.m. As of late Sunday, more than 850 homes were confirmed destroyed, but officials said many more structures had probably been consumed in areas that firefighters had not yet reached. More than a dozen shelters had been set up across the region for those who lost their homes or were forced from them. Ash and soot blew across roadways like a dusting of dirty snow. Closer to the fires, the ground was covered in more than a half-inch of ash. The sky was so dark with smoke in some areas that sensors turned on automatic outdoor lights. Smoke could be seen and smelled all the way to the coast. Hundreds of miles of freeways and mountain roads were closed to all traffic except firefighters going in and evacuees coming out. The flames were driven by brutal Santa Ana winds gusting to 60 miles an hour and made worse by extremely low humidity. The most destructive fire, in the San Bernardino National Forest north and east of here, was fed by more than a million mature pine trees killed over the past year by a bark beetle infestation and drought. The fire front in the national forest was nearly 40 miles long, United States Forest Service officials said. ''This is a fire not to be taken lightly,'' said Stanton Florea, a forest service spokesman in San Bernardino. ''It is just exploding at the higher elevations and moving down.'' He could give no estimate when the fire would be brought under any level of control. Officials and residents knew that the forest was a tinderbox. Arson is suspected in several of the blazes. ''Everyone knew it was just a matter of time,'' said Tom Baker as he stood outside the smoldering ruins of his home in the Del Rosa section of San Bernardino, which was devastated by the fire late on Saturday. ''We were all collectively holding our breaths, but our luck didn't hold.'' Mr. Baker, a retired arson investigator for the San Bernardino police, said that he and his wife, Lydia, watched the flames pour down the hillside above his neighborhood and leap into the crowns of palm trees along his street. They rushed to salvage valuable papers and photographs as the winds blew flaming palm fronds into his yard, finally igniting the garage as the couple fled in their car. Houses on either side of the Bakers' home were intact, but the fire leveled the house directly across the street. ''We're over the shock and crying for now,'' Ms. Baker said. ''We got some things out, but there's a lot of stuff still in there. It's just a fiasco.'' Gov. Gray Davis declared a state of emergency in San Bernardino and Ventura Counties late on Saturday. He added Los Angeles and San Diego Counties on Sunday and asked President Bush for federal assistance. Mr. Davis said the fires were the worst in California in at least a decade. Steve Maviglio, the governor's press secretary, said that the state had mobilized units of the California National Guard and assigned six helicopters to firefighting duty. ''We've put all the resources we have to work,'' Mr. Maviglio said, ''but nature bats last.'' The state is urging residents of Southern California to conserve energy, as many households are running their air-conditioning to contend with the smoke and heat. The fires threatened electrical transmission facilities providing power to 25 percent of the population of the region, a Southern California Edison spokesman said. Aerial tankers were grounded for much of the day Sunday because of the high winds and poor visibility, forest service officials said. The only aircraft working on Sunday afternoon were heavy-lift helicopters dropping water, but their efforts were largely for naught. Paul A. Turk, a spokesman for the aviation administration in Washington, said that fire had come dangerously close to the Southern California Terminal Radar Approach Control, on the Marine Corps' Miramar Air Station, the site of two fires in the San Diego area. Mr. Turk said the center's functions had been transferred to a center in Palmdale, about 50 miles north of Los Angeles in the Mojave Desert, which normally handles high altitude air traffic. At 3 p.m., the F.A.A. downgraded the restrictions to a delay, which was still in force into the early evening. The stoppage and delay affected aircraft bound for or leaving all the major airports in the region, including Los Angeles International Airport, Lindbergh Field in San Diego and the airports in Long Beach, Santa Ana, Burbank and Ontario. Mr. Turk said those actions caused the backups across the nation. The fire affecting the air traffic center was one of several that erupted in San Diego County late Saturday, with uncontrolled brush fires nearly encircling the city. Chief Jeff Bowman of the San Diego Fire Department said there were six fire fronts in the county, from the Mexican border to Valley Center, near Escondido. Fire had jumped Interstate 15 and was burning along the runways at the Miramar air station, heading south and west toward heavily populated neighborhoods. Weather officials said San Diego had not had any measurable rain in 174 days. The fires are raging up bone-dry canyons choked with brush and exploding into the dry leaves of eucalyptus groves. Burning balls of tumbleweed driven by high winds swept the fire across 10 lanes of I-15 in central San Diego County. Sheriff Bill Kolender of San Diego County said the fires in the county had consumed 108,000 acres, destroyed 136 homes and killed 11 people. Fire department officials said none of the four main fires in San Diego County were under control. Mr. Kolender said the biggest San Diego fire began on Saturday near the mountain town of Julian when a lost hunter lit a signal fire. The hunter was arrested and may face charges. At a news conference at 5:10 p.m., Mayor Dick Murphy of San Diego appealed to employers in the countyto allow their employees to stay home on Monday. ''Everybody not essential to city services should stay off the freeways,'' Mr. Murphy said. The San Diego City schools superintendent, Alan Bersin, announced the closure of all schools on Monday. The National Football League moved Monday night's San Diego Chargers-Miami Dolphins game to Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Ariz., from Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego because of the fires. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in a statement Sunday night that the City of San Diego had advised the league that it could not play the game in Qualcomm. In Ventura County, north and west of Los Angeles, two wildfires raged uncontrolled over 50,000 acres near the cities of Simi Valley and Moorpark. A Ventura County Fire Department spokesman said that at least six homes had been destroyed and eight more damaged but that the number was expected to rise. The department fears the fire will jump into the Santa Susanna Mountain Range and reach the community of Thousand Oaks. But they do not have the equipment yet to construct a firebreak, officials said. ''We have enough resources to protect structures, but we haven't been able to build perimeter control,'' said John Foy, spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department. ''We have some bulldozers and we are trying to get more. We are getting help from northern California, but it is hard to get them here fast enough.'' There is some concern that the fire could threaten the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley. The authorities have assigned a team to protect the property. At a Red Cross shelter for evacuees at the San Bernardino International Airport, families huddled on cots, wondered when they might return home and worried about what they might find when they did. Jim Robertson, a heavy-equipment company owner who lives in Crestline, was able to save only his business files and his family's two bulldogs, Humphrey and Bogart. Mr. Robertson said that even though he had removed the beetle-infested trees from around his property, he doubted that his home of 15 years was still standing. ''We had a scare last year, but this is insane,'' Mr. Robertson said. He said the mandatory evacuation on Saturday night was terrifying and chaotic. ''It was horrible, like a scene from a movie. There were people fighting at the gas pumps.'' Elsewhere at the airport evacuation center, San Bernardino County animal control had its hands full trying to manage dozens of pets brought by evacuees. ''It's been a long day,'' Keith McIntosh, an animal control officer, said. ''We're trying to make this stress-free for the animals, which is difficult to do given the wind and heat. We have 43 dogs, 30-something cats, birds, turtles, fish, five or six rats and a couple of guinea pigs.'' The authorities were also struggling to move hundreds of horses from the path of the fires."
"Driven by powerful desert winds, a wildfire that tore through the southern foothills of the San Bernardino National Forest early Friday forced the evacuation of several thousand people and spread dense smoke all the way to Los Angeles, 50 miles to the west. The so-called Grand Prix blaze, which investigators suspect was deliberately set, was one of three burning on Friday in Southern California, aided by extremely high temperatures and winds that firefighters fear could reach 50 miles per hour in the next couple of days. Authorities monitoring the fire here said at least four houses were destroyed in a rural area as the blaze, which is named after a nearby racetrack, expanded to more than 12,000 acres. Two freeways -- one a heavily traveled road that Southern Californians use to get to Las Vegas, which was later reopened -- were closed on Friday morning after heavy foglike smoke made driving treacherous. At one point, the fire jumped the freeway, the police said. Fire officials at a command center in a sports stadium here said the fire burst to life on Tuesday near the Hunter's Ridge subdivision, and residents of the area, who were evacuated on Thursday afternoon and Friday, were asked if they had seen any suspicious activity at the time. About 1,500 firefighters here and north of the neighboring city of Rancho Cucamonga battled flames with helicopters, air tankers and bulldozers. Some were stationed in the backyards of hillside homes, flames licking the slopes just a quarter of a mile away. ''It looked like the whole horizon was on fire,'' said Anne Boncyk, a nurse and a resident of Hunter's Ridge who was ordered by the police to leave her home early Friday with her three children, David, 10, Mark, 9, and Molly, 7. ''It was surreal. It was snowing ash. Everyone on the street was rushing around, their garage doors flying open, flinging stuff into their cars. A policeman was banging on people's doors, telling them to leave.'' Mrs. Boncyk's husband, Wayne, had taken the family's only car to work, so she and the children had to catch a ride with neighbors. ''It was really scary,'' Molly said. ''I only had time to take three dolls. And we had to leave our pets.'' For several hours, there was concern over the fate of the Boncyks' pets, three guinea pigs and a parakeet. Animal control officers took note of dozens of stranded animals and told their owners they would do their best to rescue them. Later in the afternoon, residents of Hunter's Ridge were allowed to return to their homes after the fire had moved away from the area. Elsewhere in Southern California, several fires continued to consume forests, brush and at least five houses. In Ventura County, northwest of Los Angeles, a fire burned about 700 acres of the Los Padres National Forest by early Friday, and was only 10 percent contained. The cause of the fire was unknown. About 50 miles north of San Diego, at the huge Camp Pendleton Marine base, a 4,100-acre fire sparked this week by live-fire exercises was being fought by 1,400 firefighters. Some 300 houses and ranches were threatened, said officials, who asked for voluntary evacuations. In the Lake View Terrace area near the Angeles National Forest, firefighters on Thursday managed to quell a fire spreading rapidly in parched, rugged terrain just 15 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Another fire, across 2,900 acres in the Reche Canyon area of Riverside County, was also contained on Thursday after destroying five homes, a barn, 21 outbuildings, a boat and several vehicles, said the police, who ascribed blame to an arsonist. Here in Fontana, about 180 evacuees were being sheltered at the Jessie Turner Community Center, one of three such shelters set up in the area with the help of the American Red Cross."
"Prodded by the wildfires raging across California, the Senate voted overwhelmingly on Thursday in favor of President Bush's plan to allow the thinning of trees on as much as 20 million acres of federal land. The vote, 80 to 14, came after a day of intense debate on the measure, which the administration contends would reduce the risk of catastrophic forest fires. The bill, a bipartisan compromise, now goes into conference with the House, which has already passed similar legislation. The White House has said it supports both bills. ''This is, in my view, the only bill that can make it to the president's desk,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, the chief sponsor of the Senate bill. ''It is a balanced approach to forest management.'' After years of forest policy that relied on suppressing fires and limited financing for forest maintenance, people on both sides of the so-called ''healthy forests'' debate agree that the nation's wildlands, particularly those in the West, are badly in need of attention. But they disagree vehemently on how to improve the condition of forests. Both the House and Senate bills would let the Forest Service speed its so-called ''fuel-reduction projects'' -- the burning of underbrush and thinning of trees -- on 20 million acres of federal woodlands at highest risk of forest fires. But unlike the House bill, which does not specify where thinning projects should be conducted, the Senate measure specifies that half the thinning projects be conducted in the ''wildland-urban interface''-- the stretch of land that separates forests from residential neighborhoods. The Senate measure would also authorize $760 million in additional federal money for the thinning, while the House bill does not provide any additional money. And while the House bill would limit judicial review of the projects, the Senate measure would give judges greater discretion, by eliminating a provision in the House measure that required courts to give weight to the findings of land management agencies in reviewing citizens' complaints about logging. Despite such changes, opponents, including environmental groups and some leading Democrats, described the bill as a giveaway to timber companies that would allow unfettered logging while suppressing citizens' complaints. ''The bill before us is a well-camouflaged attempt to limit the right of the American people to know and to question what their government is doing on the public's lands,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. ''It could not be clearer that the administration does not want the public or the independent judiciary looking over its shoulder.'' During Senate debate on Thursday, Mr. Wyden urged his colleagues to adopt the compromise intact. But other Democrats, including Mr. Leahy, spent the day trying to alter the measure. The Senate beat back a string of amendments, including those that would have required more financing for firefighters, greater judicial review of logging decisions and more thinning projects in the wildland-urban interface. By early evening, however, it was clear that final passage was assured."
"WHEN it comes to fighting forest fires, time is more than money. It's acreage as well. ''Fire growth is a nonlinear function of time,'' said David Martell, a professor of forestry at the University of Toronto who runs a fire management laboratory there. ''If it takes twice as long to find a fire, it will be four times the size when you get there. You definitely want to find it when it's smoldering.'' But finding a fire that is still in its formative stages isn't easy. Satellites only provide an alert after a blaze covers a large enough area to be seen from orbit. Motorists and hikers with cellphones often report small fires, but there are plenty of places that are far from roads or trails. In their efforts to fight forest fires, the United States Forest Service and other agencies have long used infrared cameras on airplanes. Because of their shortcomings, however, the systems are more commonly used to map the progress of known fires than to discover new ones. Now Donald McKeown and Michael Richardson, two imaging scientists at the Rochester Institute of Technology, have come up with an airborne array of four digital cameras that they plan to begin testing this summer. They say the array will overcome several significant problems with current aerial camera systems and distinguish fires as small as one foot across from a height of 10,000 feet. ''The Forest Service basically wants to see a smoldering stump,'' Mr. McKeown said. Although a smoldering tree stump might seem relatively innocuous, it can act as a kind of time-delay fuse to start a major fire. After a lightning strike, the most common cause of forest fires, a stump can smolder harmlessly for days. But if a strong wind comes up, embers can jump to nearby trees or underbrush, causing fire to spread quickly through a forest. Initially Mr. McKeown and Mr. Richardson, who formerly developed custom imaging systems at Eastman Kodak, looked at the possibility of creating a special high-resolution satellite dedicated to finding forest fires. But they concluded that improving airborne surveillance technology made more sense, at least in the United States. Mr. Richardson and Mr. McKeown found that current airborne systems have not been significantly upgraded in many years. ''They're using 25-year-old technology,'' said Mr. Richardson. The biggest problem with current fire-spotting cameras is their tendency to generate false alarms. They use two cameras, each sensitive to different wavelengths of infrared light. But on their operator displays, the infrared radiation created by sunlight reflecting off rocks and water is generally indistinguishable from the radiation generated by a fire. As a result, firefighters usually wait until nightfall to search forests with those airborne cameras after, say, a major lightning storm. The key to the new system lies in the relationship between the radiation of energy and wavelengths, discovered by the physicist Max Planck. Basically, Mr. McKeown said, hotter objects emit more radiation in shorter wavelengths, peaking near one end of the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Cooler objects emit radiation in longer wavelengths peaking nearer the other end of the infrared portion. By analyzing the distribution of wavelengths of a particular light source -- a spectral fingerprint, in essence -- a detection system can indicate what kind of source it is. Reflected sunlight, for instance, has more shorter-wavelength light than the flames of a forest fire, Mr. McKeown said. Because they rely on only two infrared cameras, current systems have difficulty analyzing the distribution of wavelengths from a hot spot. ''If I only sample two points, I won't know if the peak is to the right of the spectrum or the left,'' he said. The two researchers believe that adding a third infrared camera to the mix will solve the problem. The infrared cameras in their test array chop the spectrum into three parts. Fires, which have values that peak toward the right, or longer-wavelength, end of the spectrum can then be easily distinguished by image analysis software. The group's camera array can uncover smaller fires largely because the resolution of infrared cameras has greatly improved over the last five years. But that increases the potential for a new kind of false forest-fire alarm: those caused by campfires and other controlled blazes. To avoid that, the R.I.T. array includes a fourth high-resolution camera that takes conventional pictures in the visible light spectrum. The fire observer who operates the system when it is airborne will only see those images. If the infrared analysis software detects a fire, it will superimpose an icon at its location. The operator can then digitally zoom in on that portion of the picture. ''If I see a tent or picnic tables next to the fire, then I know it's fine,'' Mr. Richardson said. Because the system can also pinpoint a fire using global positioning system technology as well as a fiber-optic gyroscope (which determines the angle at which the cameras were pointing when they snapped their images), the operator can also precisely direct firefighters to the scene by radio or e-mail. ''If the cost-effectiveness of this technology is good, then it will be a valuable contribution,'' Dr. Martell said. The Rochester researchers estimate that a production version of their camera array, along with its computer system, will cost $500,000 to $750,000. Before production begins, however, the Rochester Institute of Technology will have a twin-engine plane fly a prototype camera array in July over a series of charcoal fires of precise size in the Rochester area. Mr. Richardson said the students who tend those fires would be responsible for bringing their own hot dogs and marshmallows. WHAT'S NEXT"
"Where the fire came through Blacks Mountain Experimental Forest last September, the ground is ash and the trees are charcoal. Black and gray are the colors, lightened only by small mounds of red dust at the base of some of the charred trunks -- the leavings of bark beetles -- and flecks of green where new growth pokes above the ash. Through the tall, ravaged columns, however, a living pine forest is visible. And as visitors inspecting the fire damage walk toward the living forest, they come to an abrupt transition. September's blaze was named the Cone Fire, for the hill where it was first thought to have begun. It burned 2,000 acres of Lassen National Forest, and 1,600 of those were in Blacks Mountain Experimental Forest, a 10,000-acre area within Lassen set up in 1934 for ecological study by the Forest Service. When the Cone Fire swept through these woods it came to a patch of forest that was different from the rest, and stopped dead, like a mime at an invisible wall. What stopped the fire was an experimental plot that had been selectively logged to thin it, and had been burned in controlled fashion. The result was an open forest, much the way it might have been 500 years ago when regular forest fires swept through the high dry country and no one tried to stop them. ''It just stopped,'' Carl N. Skinner said, looking satisfied but almost surprised. Mr. Skinner, a geographer with the Forest Service at the Redding Silviculture Laboratory in Redding, Calif., and Dr. Steve Zack, a conservation scientist with the North American Program of the Wildlife Conservation Society, along with other Forest Service colleagues, are showing a reporter the results of an accidental experiment that still impresses them each time they visit it. ''Night and day,'' Dr. Zack said. ''If we hadn't treated this it would have just blown right through this area,'' Mr. Skinner said. The members of the group are part of a cooperative research project involving different parts of the Forest Service and the Wildlife Conservation Society. The researchers have been trying different forest management plans on 12 250-acre research plots for about seven years. The point was never to find out how best to stop fires. Instead the research was meant to develop a general picture of how different management techniques affect forest ecosystems. In the past, many forests were either cut down for timber or left alone. A century of fire suppression resulted in the accumulated underbrush and thick tree growth that can fuel catastrophic wildfires. Parts of Blacks Mountain and the surrounding Lassen National Forest have had enough time to grow thick and brushy. In the experimental plots, some were selectively logged, either to remove bigger trees, to mimic one lucrative logging approach, or to leave a wide range of tree sizes. The plots that had the large trees removed were so-called low diversity plots. ''So much of this kind of forest has had the large trees removed over the years,'' Mr. Skinner said, and now ''we have very dense forests that need thinning now from a fire hazard perspective. This is what many of them are going to end up looking like.'' Other plots were both thinned and subjected to prescribed burns -- fires set by the researchers, a management policy that is followed in many national forests. Finally, some areas were subjected to prescribed burns only. The researchers -- fire ecologists, wildlife specialists, botanists -- have followed the changes in plant growth, tree growth and wildlife populations in all the different situations. Ponderosa pine forests are no strangers to fire. Mr. Skinner has taken samples of trees up to 700 years old to find out their fire history. Most trees showed evidence of some sort of fire about every 7 to 10 years. And big, intense fires occurred every 20 years or so, up until a century ago when the idea of fighting forest fires took hold. Once the natural fires were stopped, Dr. Zack said, the Ponderosa and Jeffrey pine forests from Baja California to British Columbia grew thick. Underbrush, fallen limbs and dry needles accumulated to make fuel to feed fires that would consume the large trees and destroy whole stands of timber. When the Cone Fire hit, it created a controlled experiment on how different management techniques, at least in this area, affected a big forest fire. The results are clear to the naked eye. The fire started in an area where the woods were thick, and quickly became intense enough to consume the woods that it went through. It was blown south and west, but it was turned away first by a mechanically thinned plot, which it scorched before dying out, and then by a plot that had been subjected to thinning and prescribed burning. The fire did not penetrate that patch at all. In the thinned area that had no controlled burn, Mr. Skinner pointed to the effects of the Cone Fire. ''We definitely changed the fire behavior and made it so the fire dropped to the ground and made it so that from a point of view of putting out fires it's easier to put out,'' he said, ''but still there's sufficient fuel here to cause a lot more damage to the stand that was left here.'' Doing controlled burns, with no thinning, worked better. But the best of all was a combination of thinning and controlled burns. The stands of moderate-size trees, what the researchers call ''low diversity,'' stopped the fire cold. The high diversity stands, which included more large trees, showed some scorching for 30 yards or so, as the fire burned the needle bed that had accumulated over five years since the last controlled burn. Then the fire died out. Dr. Scott Stephens, director of the Stephens Laboratory for Wildland Fire Science at the University of California at Berkeley, has been to Blacks Mountain Forest and seen what happened when the Cone Fire hit. He said in an interview that this kind of accidental research with rigorous data was very rare. He would have predicted, he said, that thinning and burning together would stop a fire, but was surprised that the plots that were thinned but not burned survived as well as they did. Many trees died, but enough lived for the stand to recover. The key, he said, was that when the small trees were cut, they were completely removed, rather than leaving remnants on the forest floor, as was done with the larger trees. That reduced the fuel on the ground. ''It really points to surface fuel reduction,'' he said, as the most important step to prevent big fires. Dr. Stephens said the Bush administration's current Healthy Forest Initiative was mainly about reducing regulation and does not specify fire management regimens. He also said he thought that not enough emphasis in the initiative was placed on reducing surface fuels by prescribed burning or other means. Whether large trees were removed or left made a big difference for wildlife, Dr. Zack said. Large trees, and large dead trees, are attractive to woodpeckers and other creatures. Although prescribed burns are common, they are also controversial, partly because of a fire in New Mexico in 2000 that destroyed 200 buildings in Los Alamos, leaving hundreds of people homeless. That fire resulted from a prescribed burn by the National Park Service that got out of control. Cost is also an issue. In plots where large trees were removed, timber sales were lucrative enough that the net gain was $1,400 an acre. Where only smaller trees were cut, the Forest Service suffered a net loss of $200 an acre. Dr. Zack and Mr. Skinner and their colleagues agree that no single panacea will solve the problems resulting from a century of fire suppression. Still, they can point to the evidence on the ground, where you can stand on a line between charred trees and healthy ones."
"Dropping flammable plastic balls from helicopters and using gas and diesel torches on the ground, firefighters here started a 5,000-acre burnout of thickly forested land in Glacier National Park in a last-ditch effort to keep the nearly 13,000-acre Robert Fire from burning hundreds of homes and businesses. The motels, restaurants and gift shops here and in Apgar, a village inside the park, are normally at the peak of their season. But all businesses were dark and silent today after officials recommended on Monday that residents evacuate in advance of the fire that had swept over a mountain and moved to about a mile from town. About 500 people evacuated, though some 60 stayed after signing a release that they would not hold officials accountable. Weather is a concern. The forecast is for temperatures in the triple digits and gusty winds. The burnout has blackened about half of the area officials would like to burn, and will continue tomorrow. They said they hoped their burnout would deprive the fire of fuel and force it to turn from the west to the north and spare the towns. ''We're trying to save the structures here,'' said Clinton Northway, supervisor of the Sierra Division of the interagency firefighting efforts charged with lighting the fires. Mr. Northway said the burnout fire should burn its way toward the Robert Fire. ''Hopefully they'll meet at the ridgeline and go out,'' he said. If they are unsuccessful, and the fire heads toward inhabited areas, firefighters are prepared. They have cleared brush from around most structures and set up sprinklers around houses and businesses to keep the humidity high in the hope that the wildfire will pass over them. Officials use a triage system to decide what to protect. ''Lives, property, forest,'' said Don Stukey, a fire safety officer. They also use a color-coded triage system for structure protection. Homes that are in heavily forested areas with difficult access may get a red code, while homes in open areas with easy access get yellow or green codes, and more manpower because they are easier to defend. Gov. Judy Martz of Montana toured the fires today. And fire officials put in a request today with national fire officials for 100 more of the best trained firefighters to help in remote and rugged terrain. Burnouts are common in Alaska, where people are few and the terrain is large. Many firefighters directing the burnout efforts are from Alaska. Most wildfires are fought by surrounding it with a fire break, a line the width of a road that has been cleared of fuels. Experts decided to use the burnout tactic here because they could not stop the fire with a line and because the land to be burned on purpose is uninhabited park land. Firefighters are trained in the use of burnouts and the ways it can be controlled. Creeks, ridgelines and roads are used as natural barriers. The wind speed and direction are also factors in controlling the fires. Topography is critical because fires run uphill. Water drops and firefighters are used in some places to keep the fire from heading in unwanted directions. As Mr. Northway and several others waited for the burnout fire to reach McDonald Creek, an army of firefighters went about their task to make the operation successful. Several yellow and black Cl-215 aircraft swooped down on the glassy mountain-ringed surface of Lake McDonald, scooped up hundreds of gallons of water, and then flew off to soak forests and keep the burnout fire from veering of course. A crew of ''hot shot'' firefighters patrolled the east flank of the set fire with chainsaws and Pulaskis, a combination ax and hoe, to keep it from jumping the wrong way. West Glacier and Apgar are surrounded by dense forests. Even if the backfire succeeds, the look of these places will be changed for a long time. ''By tonight,'' said Mr. Northway, ''all that you see is green will be gone.'' Not everyone is happy with the idea of a new fire, even if it is meant for protection. ''I can't imagine lighting matches in the forest,'' said Darrin Tyree, who evacuated his property near West Glacier. ''We don't know what Mother Nature has in store.'' There are two other fires burning in and around Glacier. The Wedge Canyon fire at the extreme northwest corner of the park has reached more than 18,000 acres. The Trapper Creek Complex fire, which is burning entirely within the park has burned 16,500 acres."
"Science satellites, launched into orbit for long-term studies of the Earth's climate, are increasingly being used for more immediate purposes like helping firefighters in their battles to contain wildfires. The satellites, components of NASA's Earth Observing System, continue their primary task of trying to understand the complex interactions among land, air, water and life on the planet that affect climate. But some of the data, instead of being held for months or years for use in scientific research, is being applied almost as soon as it is gathered to practical problems, like improving weather forecasts and monitoring forest fires. ''We are interested in NASA assets being used for scientific research, but also for real-world applications,'' said Dr. Vincent V. Salomonson, a senior scientist at the agency's Goddard Space Center in Greenbelt, Md. To further this purpose, he said, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is developing improved sensors to gather better data and looking at innovative ways to apply them to everyday problems. ''We are experimenting with flying satellites in formation to use multiple sensors to monitor things such as fires,'' said Dr. Salomonson, who is an atmospheric scientist. While fires burn about four million acres annually in the United States, last year's particularly bad season resulted in more than six million acres of forestland being engulfed. So far this year, more than 41,000 fires have consumed some 2.3 million acres, mostly in Western states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. To monitor these fires, data from several NASA spacecraft is being channeled into computer models that update active fire maps several times a day. This data helps fire managers on the ground determine where to put their resources, pinpointing which areas should be watched more closely by aircraft and where best to position firefighters to contain a blaze, experts said. NASA, the United States Forest Service and the University of Maryland have combined resources to produce a rapid response system to monitor and map the thousands of forest and brush fires each summer. Two satellites in this effort are TERRA, launched in 1999 to study the interaction between land and oceans, as well as radiation taken in and given off by the planet, and AQUA, which was orbited in 2002 to look at the continual transfer of water between the atmosphere and the land and seas. Both satellites, which are in 438-mile orbits that cross the Earth's poles, contain nearly identical instruments called Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (Modis) that measure multiple bands of visible and infrared radiation. The Modis instruments measure ice and snow cover, vegetation, land surface characteristics, atmospheric aerosol particles and heat from fires. The satellites make morning and afternoon observations daily of almost every point on Earth, and the Modis instruments keep track of the extent and intensity of fires. They also provide altitude estimates of smoke plumes. Modis data processed and transmitted at the Goddard center, and computer models and software developed at the University of Maryland to use it, goes into updating active fire maps three to four times a day. The maps and other information, which is shared with a number of government fire monitoring and fighting agencies, are available on http://activefiremaps.fs.fed.us/ index.html and http://rapidfire. sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/. To expedite making maps available to help in fighting current fires, the Forest Service built its own receiving station to retrieve Modis data in real time directly at its Remote Sensing Applications Center in Salt Lake City. The center prepares active fire maps three times a day for the entire country. ''Yesterday's fire map has very little value to a fire manager making a decision today,'' said Thomas J. Bobbe, the center's manager. However, he said, some satellite imagery is useful after a fire to assess damage and plan recovery efforts. The Forest Service and other land management agencies prepare emergency response plans to stabilize soils, protect water supplies and replant vegetation to prevent erosion and use the satellite data to help determine which areas should be dealt with first, Mr. Bobbe said. Dr. Christopher O. Justice of the University of Maryland, a member of the Modis instrument science team specializing in application of the data to land issues, said fire had a major impact worldwide. Fires not only greatly impact atmospheric chemistry, he said, but are also a major factor in land use. While most wildfires are caused by lightning, Dr. Justice said, human activity is a big influence. ''As humans move into an area, you see changes in fire frequency,'' he said. ''There is active deforestation, where people start fires to make and maintain pasture. In other cases, people moving into a forested area, just building more homes and living there, cause a change in fire frequency and the impact of fires.'' Monitoring by satellites is a key to understanding the impact of fires, Dr. Justice said. ''Fires in Africa produce plumes that go out to Brazil and fires in Brazil the other way,'' he said.''Smoke spreads the effects to places far away and we have to look at this on a broader scale.''"
"IT'S wildfire season, the time not only for burned forests but for the erosion that often follows when bare, scorched soil repels rain instead of letting it infiltrate. The damage from such erosion -- from mudslides to contamination of reservoirs -- can be extensive. So conservation teams typically move in quickly, often before the fire has been extinguished, to assess problems and protect homes and water supplies before rain comes. Now, computer technology may help speed up this job. Instead of getting out their rulers and topographic maps and analyzing each slope for its erosion potential, some workers may soon use software to download digital topographical maps and other data, quickly connecting the information to a computer model. Chris S. Renschler, an assistant professor of geography at the University at Buffalo, part of the SUNY system, has written software to link people confronting forest fires to a wealth of free geographic data collected by the government and available online. His program, called GeoWepp, leads them to information specific to the place where the fire is burning, then helps them plug this data into a program that estimates problems in watersheds. ''For years we have been doing this erosion assessment by hand,'' said William Elliot, an agricultural engineer and project leader at the Rocky Mountain Research Station of the United States Forest Service in Moscow, Idaho. Some of the required information might be readily available, but items like the calculation of slopes take time, particularly given the large acreage typical of forest fires. Workers, though, have only a small window of time in which to assess erosion risk. Runoff causes flooding, and the sediment in water causes problems, too, Dr. Elliot said, especially in Western areas where runoff is a main source of drinking water. Endangered species in forest streams are also affected by the sediment. ''We've wanted to figure out a way to use Internet databases and computer software analysis to speed matters up,'' he said. The software interface created by Dr. Renschler permits this, in part by doing many of the calculations needed for the model automatically. For instance, when users get access to digital records of terrain elevations provided by the United States Geological Survey, slopes can then be calculated automatically. ''In seconds, you can tell how steep the hills are and where possible channels are,'' Dr. Renschler said. Successfully linking the vast reservoir of online digital information to the watershed model was complicated, he said, primarily because most geological survey data these days is designed for use with a fairly new computer technology usually called G.I.S., for geographical information systems. G.I.S. is software in which attributes of data like elevation are linked directly to their location, making possible the creation of maps that show at a glance, for example, rivers and streams in a watershed. But the erosion model was developed independent of G.I.S. technology and was not compatible with it. So Dr. Renschler retrofitted the model, a national project to which about 30 scientists have contributed, to make it match the new world of G.I.S. The need was pressing. ''It took me a month when I first tried to prepare the data describing a particular location manually for the model,'' he said of early attempts in 2000, when he was a postdoctoral researcher in the Agricultural Research Service's National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory, on the campus of Purdue University. Three years later, he thinks he has succeeded. ''Using the interface, I now have the process down to 15 minutes,'' he said. To make the interface fast and appealing, even for beginners, Dr. Renschler wrote subprograms that work interactively with users to derive networks of erosion channels that might develop and then display these networks in maps. He led users to data describing local climate and soil conditions. He even arranged for viewers to see measurements in English units if they preferred. ''Lots of people want to use acres rather than hectares,'' he said. Workers still have to go out into the field after a fire to see how the vegetation cover has changed and to assess burn severity. ''But that's the only variable you'll have to go out and get yourself,'' he said. About half a dozen workshops have been held to introduce people working in erosion prediction to the new tool, Dr. Renschler said, including a session last March at the Bureau of Land Management's National Science and Technology Center in Denver. Bill Ypsilantis, a soil scientist at the bureau who organized that workshop, said the new interface met an important need for access to G.I.S. data. ''We need a handle on predicting accelerated erosion from wildfires and prescribed burns,'' he said. The price tag for mitigating erosion, using measures like seeding or creating log barriers to catch sediment, is substantial. The cost to Forest Service areas after the Hayman fire southwest of Denver last year, which burned nearly 140,000 acres, was more than $14 million, Dr. Elliot said. The new interface has its costs, too, said Dennis Flanagan, who heads the National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory. Users need roughly $2,000 worth of G.I.S. software on their computers, he said. G.I.S. capability is increasingly common among conservation groups, but not among the broader audience Dr. Flanagan hopes to reach in the future. ''It would be good if one day they were able to do comparable types of simulations via a Web site that runs the G.I.S. there,'' he said. Dr. Elliot, the project leader at the Forest Service's Rocky Mountain Research Station, said the new interface might be tested in the field later this summer. If that happens, Dr. Renschler is ready. ''Over the winter we will include any comments we get back from people during the fire season'' for revisions of the tool, he said. ''Erosion is a huge, complex problem,'' he said. ''You don't want to waste any time in fighting it.'' WHAT'S NEXT"
"A sweaty sense of dislocation was palpable today throughout Europe, where unusually high temperatures and a summerlong dearth of rain have damaged crops, fanned wildfires, and left residents and tourists baking, broiling and steaming as seldom before. Power grids were under strain as people in countries normally suspicious of air-conditioning suddenly jettisoned their reservations and embraced -- or longed for -- even a manufactured breeze. In the northern Italian city of Genoa on Monday, employees at the city's justice department left their offices, which are not air-conditioned, to protest that fact. German officials publicly debated whether employees should be allowed to leave work, because of the heat, and retreat to less stressful, cooler environments. In Britain, many of the heat-addled people who passed through Trafalgar Square turned its fountains into wading pools, a desperate recourse for desperate weather. Penguins at the London Zoo were fed fish-flavored Popsicles, Reuters reported, while sunscreen was slathered onto pigs at another zoo. ''I haven't seen heat like this in 70 years,'' said Stefano Colvolino, a 70-year-old traffic officer in Rome. Mr. Colvolino said that while individual weeks in the past had been hotter, he had never encountered a three-month stretch, from early May to the present, so consistently stifling. ''It's totally impossible,'' he said as he stood, deeply tanned and visibly perspiring, near Campo de' Fiori late this afternoon. ''I'm out on the streets four hours a day. They're the four worst hours of the day.'' Mr. Colvolino was actually lucky: the mercury hit only 98.6 degrees at its peak in Rome today. In Florence, it was 104. ''At this point, Italy has become a tropical country,'' said Gabriela Medei, who sells fruit in Campo de' Fiori. The hot, arid weather left conditions ripe for wildfires, especially in Portugal, where thousands of firefighters are battling blazes that have, over the last week, destroyed more than 100,000 acres of woodland and killed at least 11 people. Hundreds of other people, in both Portugal and adjacent areas of Spain, have been evacuated from their homes to be out of fires' paths. Here in Italy, where anything beyond a squirt of rain is a memory so distant as to seem like a fantasy, farmers contemplate harvests of grapes, olives, peaches and apricots that might turn out to be 50 percent below normal. Already, the prices of many fruits and vegetables have shot up by 20 percent, according to the Agriculture Ministry. Agricultural groups estimate the financial toll on Italian farmers at about $6 billion so far. France is suffering a similar drought, with similar consequences. Farmers in much of the country have had to observe alternate-day irrigation plans. Ships plying the Danube in Eastern Europe carry restricted loads so they do not scrape bottom. Water levels in the river have declined so much that dredgers in Romania have had to deepen some channels so ships can pass. Britain has canceled some trains on busy routes and imposed reduced, temporary speed limits on others to make sure that rails do not buckle in unusually intense temperatures nearing 95 degrees. Around the city of Bradenburg, in eastern Germany, officials were barring people from entering forests in an effort to prevent fires. The summer drought had contributed to 300 forest fires in that area this year, officials said. Throughout Italy, the heavier use of air-conditioning and fans was contributing to a daily demand on electricity that was 2,000 megawatts higher than usual, and energy officials warned of blackouts if the situation did not improve. ''The problem is very serious, very grave,'' said a spokesman for one of the country's largest energy providers. Here and elsewhere, public health officials urged elderly people in fragile health to stay as cool as possible, and there were scattered reports throughout Europe of deaths attributable to the heat. Spain and Portugal have suffered the worst of it. In some areas of the Iberian peninsula, temperatures over recent days have surpassed 110 degrees. Spanish officials said the heat had been responsible for at least 12 deaths since Friday. There were also forest fires in Spain, although not on the scale of Portugal, which declared a national disaster on Monday. Portuguese officials were marshaling all the resources they could to battle the fires, which they said late today were beginning to be contained. They also appealed for help from NATO. ''We are facing an exceptional situation,'' the Portuguese prime minister, José Durão Barroso, told reporters after an emergency cabinet meeting on Monday. ''It's been brought about by absolutely exceptional weather conditions, so we have to respond with exceptional measures.''"
"A year ago, President Bush used the the worst of last summer's forest fires, the Biscuit fire in southern Oregon, as a backdrop to unveil his Healthy Forests initiative -- a plan that on close inspection has less to do with preventing forest fires than it does with helping his friends in the timber industry. In a replay yesterday, Mr. Bush used a visit to the site of the Aspen fire in Arizona to reaffirm his support for the same strategy. The strategy has not improved with age. Indeed, as encapsulated in legislation that was passed by the House and is nearing approval in the Senate, it may have gotten worse. On its face, the plan seems innocent enough. It would increase the Forest Service's fire-prevention budget and presumably the service's ability to stop fires before they happen by aggressively thinning overgrown forests and deliberately setting controlled fires to prevent even bigger blazes. The problem with the plan is that it is hopelessly, perhaps deliberately, vague. It does not specifically require that the money be spent where it would obviously do the most good, at the urbanized edges of the forests, where homeowners and their property are most at risk. Indeed, its mandate is so broad that it practically invites commercial logging on millions of acres in remote areas of the national forests, where fires pose little or no threat to people or property but where the trees are the biggest and the opportunities for profit are the largest. In the name of expediting ''fuel reduction,'' the plan would also ease important environmental laws, reduce the opportunity for public comment and restrict judicial review. The administration says it merely wants to stop frivolous lawsuits that block important projects. Several academic and government studies, including two by the General Accounting Office, have said that the administration's claims are mostly invention, and that citizen reviews and accepted legal processes have posed no real obstacle to fire prevention. The biggest obstacle is that the government is spending the money in the wrong place. Even the communities he wants to help say Mr. Bush has his priorities wrong. The Arizona Daily Star noted in an editorial yesterday that there had been only one legal challenge in three years to a fuel-reduction project in the Coronado National Forest, the site of the Aspen fire, and that it had been settled expeditiously. Meanwhile, local pleas for more targeted tree-thinning around the communities damaged by the fire had gone unanswered."
"Much of a month-old blaze, the first major one of the New Mexico wildfire season, was contained in the Lincoln National Forest over the weekend, but officials said that since Saturday, a second fire had engulfed more than 1,800 acres in the Cibola National Forest. ''We still don't have much control over this fire,'' Jim Whittington of the National Park Service said of the new blaze. Though still burning out of control, that fire, about 60 miles west of Albuquerque, appeared to have stalled on a Mount Sedgwick ridge and had begun to slide back down rather than cross to the other side of the mountain, Mr. Whittington said. He added that the firefighters' jobs would have been greatly complicated had the blaze kept moving past the ridge. Only the Ojo Redondo Campground, about three miles from the fire, had to be evacuated. No injuries were reported. Officials were keeping a close watch on the winds, which were expected to gust as much as 20 miles per hour, and on the Bluewater Village, a retirement community of about 500 residents eight miles northeast of the fire. ''At this time we do not see a need to evacuate the village, but we are closely monitoring the fire's progress,'' Mr. Whittington said, adding that there was a sizable area between the fire and the village and that the buffer zone had no vegetation to fuel flames. Archaeological sites in the area were also being closely watched, but there was no further information available. Officials said they suspected the blaze had started Saturday afternoon with a man-made fire in a canyon area, which was closed to campers, at the base of Mount Sedgwick. By the time specially trained ''Hot Shot'' teams, which the United States Forest Service dispatches across the West, arrived about 3:30 p.m., the blaze had spread across 100 acres. The fire, about seven miles south of Interstate 40, ''was being fueled by heavy timber up steep slopes, making it difficult to fight,'' Ken Frederick of the Forest Service said. On Sunday, officials upgraded the severity of the fire, from Type III to Type II, a change that is usually made when a blaze exceeds the capabilities of local firefighting units. Throughout the weekend, firefighters battled gusting winds, high temperatures, low humidity and the steep slopes of Mount Sedgwick as they established lines to stem the fire's spread. Forecasts called for the winds to lighten through Monday. ''We're seeing the effects of a prolonged drought and hot, dry weather,'' Mr. Whittington said, referring to the dry conditions throughout the Southwest that have caused wildfires in Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico. He said that he though he could not see flames from his office, 15 miles from the fire line, he could see the dense, white smoke that was spreading throughout the region. Officials were concerned that the smoke would lower visibility along Interstate 40 in the 50 miles between Grants, a popular stopping point for tourists interested in hiking and other activities, and Albuquerque. The smoke was expected to thicken and then eventually settle in the valley near Albuquerque. ''Signs will be put up on I-40 to warn travelers of decreased visibility,'' Mr. Whittington said. That stretch of the Interstate was the scene of two deadly multiple-car accidents in April, when visibility was obscured by dust storms. Officials said there were 90 people fighting the fire, including workers from Wyoming, Santa Fe and two local wildfire units. Aiding in the effort were four helicopters and two Air Force C-130's from Peterson Air Force Base near Colorado Springs. The planes, laden with 2,700 gallons of fire-suppressing chemicals, each made one pass over the fire. They flew to Williams Gateway Airport in Mesa, Ariz., where they were on standbylate Sunday. While units arrived at the Sedgwick Fire, the Peppin Fire in the Lincoln National Forest, about 250 miles to the south, was declared 85 percent contained after 59,200 acres had burned . Federal forest officials said the Peppin Fire was caused by a lightning storm that passed through the region on May 10. The fire was not discovered until five days later."
