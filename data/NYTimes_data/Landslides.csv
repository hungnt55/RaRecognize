"As usual, John Vélez, 13, and his younger brother, Jaime, 11, did not go to school last Thursday. The boys awoke at 4 a.m. as always, put on the same dirt-caked trousers and rubber boots they had worn the day before and, following their father, began a long walk along the muddy Cauca River to the huge open-pit gold mine just outside this village. They thought their diligence had paid off: the three scrambled ahead of dozens of others into the quarry at 6 a.m. sharp, the starting time, and found a place in the deepest reaches -- exactly where they believed they would strike gold. ''We thought we had found the perfect spot,'' said the boys' father, Jaime Jesús Vélez, 34. But with the sun just starting to rise, the craggy outer wall of the excavation gave way before the Vélez family and dozens of other miners knew what was happening. A cascade of mud and rocks rained down. Those deepest inside the pit -- in what they thought were choice spots for digging -- were quickly swallowed up, including John Vélez, who drowned in the muck as his father and brother scrambled to safety. In all, at least 67 people died, the Colombian Red Cross said today, an enormous loss of life that has shaken this poverty-stricken community. The most excruciatingly painful part was the deaths of at least six children -- little boys who had never enjoyed normal childhoods. Instead of attending classes and playing schoolyard games, they spent their days digging, toting dirt and panning for gold. Indeed, children as young as 5 in this mountainous region of central Colombia often accompany their parents to the gold mines. Smaller children simply tag along, with the patient ones permitted to work the wood-frame sieves used to pan for gold. The bigger ones dig, using long metal picks or shovels. It has to be that way, parents explained, to help a family make ends meet. ''I knew it was dangerous,'' said María del Carmen Castro, whose son, Carlos Ladino, 15, perished. ''It would scare me, but we had to live, so this supported us. Here, there is nothing else.'' With little else to sustain the local economy, people here have long overlooked the dangers and hardships and have seen mining as a decent way to make a living. Some work in 300-yard-long shafts dug into mountainsides, where they are paid by the owners for a day's work. Others work in wide-open quarries like El Pescadero, the mine along the fast-moving Cauca River where Thursday's landslide took place. In El Pescadero, which roughly means the fishing hole, the owners allowed miners to seek their fortune from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. daily, before the owner's own daily mining operation began, and keep whatever they found without having to fork over a fee. In a long-established tradition, area residents ensured that local mine owners permitted the practice, often under threat of protest, said Chepe Espinosa, a local leader of the miners. ''You go in, you go through the dirt, you figure out where you might find gold and you dig,'' said Rigoberto Ceballos, 48, who lost two friends in the accident. ''This is the art we know, so this is what we do.'' Working in teams of four or five, miners would sometimes come up with enough gold in a day to net each of them $30 from local gold brokers. The take, though, was usually far less, perhaps a few dollars per person -- not much, but still far more than itinerant pickers make harvesting coffee or sugar cane. ''We would find gold; that is normal,'' explained Carlos Alberto Vélez, 23, who is not related to the other Vélez family and who has been working in mines since age 10 and lost his brother, Bernardo, 28, on Thursday. ''But we do not celebrate and scream out when we find gold. It just means that you have enough to eat.'' That children worked in El Pescadero and other mines is not viewed as mistreatment, but simply as a necessity. Here, children grow up hearing stories of miners who have struck it big -- and the prospect of even a few dollars worth of gold is enough to lure the little ones. ''You can make your own money,'' explained Juan Carlos Aricapa, 13, who said he would return to mining, though he barely escaped alive in the landslide. ''You do not have to ask the rich people for jobs. You work for yourself.'' It seems that most people in Irra took that prospect to heart, knowing that since there was gold in the hills around town all they had to do was find it. So, it was not unusual, at El Pescadero and other mines, for entire families to labor together -- the father digging, the children carrying dirt, the mother panning for gold. ''I liked to sift and find the gold,'' explained little Jaime Vélez, who began a year ago, at age 10. ''I would get very happy when I would find gold.'' Gloria Paro, mother of Jaime and John, said that from time to time she would urge her children not to mine, admonishing them that school would be a better alternative. But she admits that she never pressed them too hard. After all, her boy John had been a good miner. ''He said he did not want to go to school, that he wanted to work,'' Ms. Paro said. Mr. Vélez added: ''You cannot hold them back. They do what they want to do.'' Today, as they recounted Thursday's nightmare, the Vélez family wondered why things went so terribly wrong, and why their boy was unable to save himself. The questions are hard to answer, since the collapse of the unfortified quarry walls happened so fast. All Mr. Vélez remembers is that bits of dirt had started to come down from the top edge of the pit, a sure signal of a coming landslide. Then he and everyone else ran. His son, he recalls, tried to grab his pants, but ''a wave of dirt just came and grabbed him, and took him away.'' ''He said, 'Daddy, Daddy, save me, save me,' '' Mr. Vélez said. ''Then he was covered by the mud.''"
"According to official records, the government of the Philippines knew as early as last May that this village in the eastern part of the country, where more than 1,000 people may have died in a landslide Friday, was in grave danger. Policies were even in place to avert a pending disaster: area villages were evacuated late last year and a logging ban, to address the deforestation that helped cause the problem, had been adopted more than a decade ago. But reality was another matter. Many residents soon returned to their homes. According to government officials and environmental groups, problems ranging from government corruption and ineffective laws to a lack of money and the political will to enforce the laws contributed to the collapse of the mountainside here in the first place, and allowed it to become a large-scale human tragedy. ''This is a failure of the implementation of laws and a failure of policy,'' said Von Hernandez, the campaign director for Southeast Asia of the environmental group Greenpeace, which had warned the government last month that its current policies were bound for trouble. On Tuesday, rescue workers continued to dig through the muck in an increasingly hopeless search for survivors. Hopes had been raised Monday afternoon when electronic sensors detected tapping sounds believed to be signs of life. But diggers found nothing but bodies and by midnight, the tapping had vanished. By Tuesday morning, the official body count had increased to 84, with about 1,000 victims still believed to be beneath the mud. Even as the rescue work continued, political leaders were already issuing recriminations and demanding reform, noting that hundreds of thousands of Filipinos, still living in more than 1,000 government-identified danger zones, remained at risk. The government had determined last May that St. Bernard, the township to which this village belongs, was one of the danger zones, prone to natural disaster, and placed it on a geological hazard map. Fracturing volcanic rocks and weathering made the area ''unstable and susceptible to mass movement,'' the environment department said in a statement over the weekend. Hundreds of residents were ordered to evacuate. But almost immediately, they began to trickle back. The problem, said Michael Defensor, a key adviser to President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and, until a few weeks ago, the environment secretary, was that the displaced people had no access to their farms or businesses. ''The residents would go back to their villages,'' he said. Critics said the government should not have allowed residents to return. ''If residents refuse to evacuate, that's where political will on the part of the government comes in,'' said Mr. Hernandez of Greenpeace. But the government declined to act, said Crispin Beltran, a member of Congress. ''Why was there a severe lack of massive reforestation program and disaster response system?'' he asked. ''Why was it that only a measly 0.1 percent of the national budget was allotted to calamity funds despite all the signs of impending tragedies?'' Clemente Bautista, an official of Kalikasan, a local environmental group, told The Philippine Daily Inquirer over the weekend that the Arroyo administration had failed to implement its own recommendations for St. Bernard, like massive reforestation and an early warning system. Local officials said they had detected what looked like fractures on the side of the mountain months before the tragedy, but they said no one thought it was serious enough to do anything about it. The underlying problem of deforestation also reflected policy failures, critics said. ''The real reason for this terrible tragedy is that forests have been badly denuded and no serious replanting has been done,'' Archbishop Gaudencio Rosales of Manila said in a statement on Sunday. ''It is time for the powers that be to address strongly these issues.'' But the logging ban already in place is widely seen as ineffective. Endemic corruption, lack of resources and weak law enforcement have allowed illegal logging to flourish and environmental predators to go unpunished, critics said. And politically, whoever sits in the presidential palace must reckon with the nation's political dynasties, several of which earned their wealth and power through logging, Mr. Hernandez said. In late 2005, for instance, the environment department allowed the resumption of logging by a company owned by a senator who is an ally of the president, over the objections of residents and religious leaders. The logging concession was within a national forest reserve. But Mr. Defensor, the former environment secretary, said the government should not be held accountable for failing to anticipate disasters. ''The government is doing its best under the circumstances,'' he said. ''We cannot relocate everyone at the same time, but measures can be put in place. And this can be done as soon as possible.'' On Sunday, President Arroyo called for action. ''We should all join hands in the preservation of our environment and protect what is left behind for the sake of the generations to come,'' she said in a national address. On Monday, she ordered the release of money to upgrade the country's geographical hazard maps."
"Elsa Misa Timbang shrieked as soon as she saw the swath of brown dirt completely covering what used to be her village. ''Where are they?'' she wailed hysterically to rescuers. Ms. Timbang had just arrived from London, hoping to see more than a dozen relatives, including her parents, six brothers and sisters and six nephews and nieces. Ms. Timbang asked again: ''Have you found anybody. Are they still alive?'' Her cries almost muffled the sound of the earth-moving equipment nearby. A rescuer shook his head. ''I don't know,'' he said. Officially, the landslide on Friday, one of the worst in this country in recent memory, killed 57 people, but more than 1,800 are still missing. Rescuers had not found any survivors by late morning on Sunday, and only three bodies had been recovered. Two hundred and forty-six people were believed buried in an elementary school building that was among the first to be buried. Rescue efforts have been focused on the school, especially since, according to relatives, some of the victims managed to send phone text messages late Friday. ''We're still in one room, alive,'' Agence France-Presse quoted a message sent to a daughter of one of the teachers. Another text message read: ''We are alive. Dig us out.'' But no more messages were reported Saturday. The sun was shinning on Sunday, after almost nonstop rain for nearly two weeks. Rescuers were still hampered by the soft mud that covered practically every inch of this village. A United States military team arrived Sunday to assess the situation and provide help. Two American military vessels and two helicopters arrived late Sunday morning. ''This is going to be tough, but we're here to help,'' said Capt. Burrell Parmer of the Army. ''Our top priority is search and rescue.'' In all, two American warships carrying 17 helicopters and 1,000 marines were diverted from military exercises, and two more Navy vessels were bringing supplies, the American Embassy said. The Philippines military dispatched trucks with medicine, rice and clothes provided by Unicef and the United States Agency for International Development. Witnesses in Guinsaugon, about 400 miles south of Manila, said there was no longer any sign of the town -- only what looked like a newly plowed field, with bits and pieces of roofing and debris from 375 destroyed homes sticking up through the mud. Rescuers were having difficulty reaching the village, on the island of Leyte, and when they arrived, they found their every effort hampered by the mud, which was at least 30 feet deep in some spots. Walking was nearly impossible, and bringing in heavy equipment to dig out survivors seemed out of the question. ''We presume that more or less than 1,800 are feared dead,'' said Lt. Col. Raul Farnacio, who was overseeing the rescue effort. The colonel said that many more bodies had been found, but that rescuers -- who were feeling bodies under their feet as they slogged through the mud -- were trying to focus on the living. ''There's just too many dead bodies,'' he said. ''For now, we are just leaving the dead because our main concern is to recover the survivors if there are any. If you ask me, hopes are dimming.'' One survivor, Alfredo Guab, 27, told The Associated Press that the inundation had taken no more than two minutes to bury the entire village. Like other survivors, he said he heard what sounded like a loud explosion before the mud came cascading down. Rescuers said mud continued to slide down the hillside, making their work more dangerous. Eleven nearby villages were evacuated, The A.P. reported. The International Red Cross began an emergency appeal for $1.5 million for relief operations, and China pledged $250,000 in cash and other emergency relief to the Philippines, the Chinese state media reported. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo said in a statement: ''I call on each Filipino to pray for the victims and the survivors. It breaks my heart to think of those precious schoolchildren whose innocence and hope have been so tragically snuffed out.'' Officials said an immediate need at the scene was for drinking water, with wells buried or contaminated. The remoteness of the area was making it difficult for supplies to be delivered. Huge landslides and flash floods occur frequently in the Philippines, where deforestation has denuded hillsides and where monsoon rains soak into the soil, then come roaring down. Eulogio Dala, municipal assessor of Guinsaugon's district, said, ''We had 30 villages before, now we only have 29.''"
"The scene was familiar, not so much for what could be seen but what couldn't. For the farming village of Guinsaugon, tucked under a mountain in the Philippines, disappeared last week, obliterated by a huge mudslide that killed most of the 1,800 people who lived there. The disaster differed only in scale from most of the scores of landslides and mudslides that have occurred around the world in recent decades. The slides kill an average of about 1,000 people a year, according to a database maintained by the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium. Landslides may not be preventable -- the Guinsaugon disaster occurred after two weeks of heavy rain -- but aren't there ways to protect people from them? Yes, said Ralph Daley, director of the International Network on Water, Environment and Health, part of the United Nations University. But often, particularly in the developing world, there is a lack of political commitment and money to do so. Mr. Daley said the technology exists to provide better short-term weather forecasting and climate modeling ''to give governments and policymakers some idea of what's coming.'' And there is agreement that more can be done to keep people off vulnerable land. But even though landslides are the seventh-biggest killer among natural disasters , he said, ''it's difficult to get political action on it -- there's so many other things that governments have to deal with.'' Already there are signs that major landslides are on the increase, the result of population growth and poverty, which have forced more and more people to occupy vulnerable land. At the same time, climate change is causing more severe weather events, like major storms and prolonged periods of rain, that set the stage for disasters. ''That's the really frightening thing,'' Mr. Daley said. HENRY FOUNTAIN The Basics"
"How to tame a mud volcano: try dropping hundreds of giant concrete balls into it. In recent weeks, using a system invented at the Bandung Institute of Technology, workers have been releasing the balls from a complicated crane-pulley-sling contraption into the steaming vent known to scientists as ''the big hole.'' Mud volcano experts are bemused. No one has ever stopped an underground mud flow, they say, least of all with a home remedy like this. Don't laugh, said Satria Bijaksana, one of three institute geologists who devised the plan, standing at the rim of a vast, dull-gray sea of mud. ''I'm not just some crazy scientist throwing out wild ideas,'' said Mr. Bijaksana, 42, who holds a doctorate in rock magnetism from Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada. ''This is not a joke.'' The mud started gushing from the ground nearly 10 months ago when a shaft probing for natural gas pierced a pressurized aquifer about 9,000 feet underground. Since then about 1 billion cubic feet of mud has spread across two square miles. The mud has buried 12 villages and 20 factories, inundating roads and rice fields and displacing 15,000 people. It is still flowing, at more than 3.5 million cubic feet a day, and no one can say when it might stop. ''After two months, we realized that this was not stopping,'' Mr. Bijaksana said, ''so we started trying to figure a way to stop it.'' The idea is to jam the gullet of the geyser with 1,000 or more balls linked together like charm bracelets, in bunches of four, the biggest of them weighing about 175 pounds. Their mass and friction, as they tangle at the bottom of the shaft, should slow the flood to a manageable ooze, Mr. Bijaksana said. But their shape will allow the mud to seep past, avoiding the pressure that could cause it to burst from the ground elsewhere. ''We want to slow it gradually,'' he said. ''A month, two months, three months. But we don't want to block it.'' Richard Davies, a geologist at Durham University in Britain and an expert on mud volcanoes, is skeptical. ''I don't think they're going to stop it with this ball idea,'' he said in a telephone interview. He said the plan could work only if the underground crater were shaped almost perfectly like an hourglass, allowing the balls to accumulate in one narrow space. ''The underground plumbing of a mud volcano, I don't think, is going to be that simple,'' he said. More likely, he said, the balls would simply disappear, swallowed by a gurgling digestive system of hot mud. He dismissed the notion that some of them could be ejected like cannonballs. ''It's a bit of a David and Goliath situation,'' said Mr. Davies, who visited the site and wrote a paper about the eruption this year. ''You're plunking these balls into a vent that is 700 meters deep and the upper part 50 meters wide,'' or about 765 yards deep and 55 yards wide. Recently, officials have reported a decrease in the volume of the flow after the insertion of nearly 400 balls. But the volcano has fluctuated since the start, and Mr. Bijaksana said it was too early to know if his system was working. Not only scientists have doubts about this approach. Chief Sgt. Sumarono, a soldier stationed at the team's media center, told The Jakarta Post that local soothsayers had said spirits who lived in the crater would be angry after being hit by the giant concrete balls. ''The mud explosion happened because the spirits in the crater are angry,'' said Sergeant Sumarono, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. ''The insertion of the balls will only spark more anger. The soothsayers have already said there will be a new and much bigger burst. I believe this.'' Geysers of mud like this are not uncommon, Mr. Davies said, but most are brief and modest, many are under the ocean and few threaten populated areas. Hundreds occur in Azerbaijan, some in Trinidad and some off the coast of Nigeria, he said. A few small ones in the Mississippi Delta are remobilizing sediment from a mile or so underground. Most are natural eruptions of pressurized mud, he said, but they can also be released when drilling hits an aquifer far underground, and the water gushes out like a fizzy soft drink. The mud started flowing here last May 29 during exploratory drilling by an Indonesian gas company, Lapindo Brantas, which is controlled by the powerful welfare minister, Aburizal Bakrie. The company says it is not at fault, and it blames a major earthquake two days earlier with an epicenter about 190 miles away. Although some Indonesian scientists have spoken out to support that claim, Mr. Davies said he doubted the earthquake caused the volcano. Some critics have blamed the company's failure to insulate part of its drill hole, but Mr. Davies said it was not clear whether that could have prevented the rock from fracturing. Mr. Davies said he was one of only a few experts on the unglamorous subject of mud volcanoes. ''The igneous ones are the popular ones,'' he said. ''Mud volcanoes are the poor brother of igneous volcanoes. There are some fairly fundamental things we don't understand about them.'' Mr. Bijaksana said he and his colleagues were on their own as they took on the volcano, developing their own theories and methods, and their own instruments for dealing with mud. ''If it doesn't work, should I be worried about what faraway scientists say?'' he said. ''People could argue about this over and over again. But this thing is real. We decided to do something.'' SIDOARJO JOURNAL"
"A week after a series of avalanches flattened this Himalayan hilltop hamlet and claimed at least 278 lives across the disputed territory of Kashmir, the police and villagers, guided by grieving survivors, continued the struggle on Saturday to find bodies under a thick blanket of snow. Record storms last week covered Kashmir with six feet of snow, halting movement, taxing food and fuel reserves, and leading thousands of villagers to seek shelter in relief camps in low-lying villages. This cattle-herding village, perched 10,000 feet above sea level in the Pir Panjal Range of the Himalayas, was among the hardest hit. Of its roughly 600 residents, at least 122 died, and the toll could climb as search efforts continue. The avalanche crushed the village, killing animals and destroying houses and trees. On Saturday, the snow walls stood 5 to 15 feet high. Rescue workers, armed with nothing more than shovels, dug through the snow in an effort to find the missing. Hazra Bano, 30, who lost 15 family members, kept her eyes on every rescue worker's shovel, hoping for traces of five relatives still unaccounted for. At a government hospital in nearby Anantnag, Muhammad Shafi, 30, who lost five relatives, was caring for four others who survived. ''All my family members are either dead or injured except me,'' said a desperate-looking Mr. Shafi. His father and youngest son are gone; his wife and eldest son are paralyzed from the waist down. His wife, Aiysha, had just finished lunch last Saturday when suddenly, she recalled, everything went dark and the snow came crashing down on her house. She said she pulled their youngest son, age 2 1/2, to her breast, but only in time for them to be trapped under the rubble. The child died in a matter of hours. For four days, caught under debris, she kept him at her breast. ''I cried, 'Please take me out,' but nobody heard my cries, and I could not move,'' she said from her hospital bed. Rescue workers found her on the fifth day. Mr. Shafi, who also lost his house and his livelihood (10 head of cattle), refuses to return to Waltengoo Nar. ''We are scared of the place now,'' he said. ''I do not know if we made a mistake or it was the curse of God.'' In a state racked by a 15-year insurgency against the Indian government, the political costs of a weak response to the avalanche are obvious, and the Indian government seems intent on demonstrating that it will spare no effort. The defense minister, Pranab Mukherjee, and the leader of India's governing Congress Party, Sonia Gandhi, toured the area earlier in the week. In the hard-hit Anantnag district, Indian Army officials said all 3,000 troops posted in the area had been assigned to relief and recovery efforts. Over the last several days, soldiers rescued stranded villagers and, with relief groups, delivered food and blankets to those stuck in the outlying villages. More than 1,000 people remained stranded on the Srinagar-Jammu Highway, the main artery connecting Kashmir with the rest of India, and were being airlifted to safety by Indian military helicopters, Reuters reported. [On Sunday, Reuters reported, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh toured the affected areas by air and pledged to double compensation to affected families, to nearly $3,000.] The weekend brought sunshine and more temperate weather, but with warmer weather expected in coming days, the snow is likely to melt, heightening the risk of more avalanches. Government officials urged people living on high ground to seek shelter further down in the valley."
"An engineering firm hired by the co-op board for Castle Village, the apartment complex that sits atop the retaining wall that collapsed onto the Henry Hudson Parkway yesterday, had been set to meet with city traffic engineers today to secure permits so they could begin buttressing the wall, city officials said. Just two weeks ago, the board alerted residents in a letter that the firm, Langan Engineering, had detected serious slippage in the wall and would begin work to reinforce it, pending the necessary approvals from the city. On Wednesday, the firm contacted the city's Department of Transportation seeking a construction permit and permission to close a lane on the Riverside Drive service road that leads down to the parkway. Traffic engineers scheduled a meeting at the site with the firm. That meeting was to occur today. The letter to residents, dated April 28, had detailed the engineering company's serious concerns about the wall's security. Langan, which specializes in this kind of work, had been monitoring the 75-foot-high wall over the last few years on behalf of the board, the letter said. Last month, engineers noticed that some of the joints between the concrete slabs that made up that wall had opened up and the sidewalk above it was shifting, the letter said. Measurements taken by the company indicated ''substantial movement,'' particularly in the section of the wall between 120 and 140 Cabrini Boulevard. It was this section that collapsed yesterday. At a news conference yesterday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said engineers from the company had been inspecting the wall as recently as yesterday morning. A retaining wall's structure is relatively simple, said Michael Horodniceanu, president of Urbitran, an engineering firm, comparing it to a giant letter ''L.'' The base typically has some sort of footing -- the horizontal part of the L -- that shoves up against the vertical portion. The weight of earth and rubble holds the footing in place. In fact, according to the letter to residents, large sinkholes had formed in the earth from water infiltrating the structure of the wall. ''It is believed that water entering through these openings is creating pressure on the lower wall, forcing it to bow out,'' the letter said. The letter to residents noted that about 20 years ago, repairs were done to pin the wall back to reduce movement. In the last decade, the board wrote, minor repairs were needed to keep surface material from shearing off. In the fall, Langan did extensive work on the wall, according to David Seroy, a shareholder in the building, to improve its water drainage system. And Langan had been planning to install a system of tiebacks, long steel rods that pin the wall to bedrock behind the wall, according to the letter. Telephone messages for executives at Langan, left at work and on cellphones, were not answered. City transportation officials said that because the wall is privately owned, neither the city nor the state was responsible for inspecting or maintaining it. Mayor Bloomberg said city workers would make sure the rest of the wall was safe. LANDSLIDE ON THE HIGHWAY: WARNINGS"
"A 75-foot-high stone retaining wall built in 1908 collapsed in a roaring avalanche onto the Henry Hudson Parkway in Upper Manhattan yesterday afternoon. No one was believed killed or hurt, but parked cars were buried and traffic in the region was thrown into bedlam for the evening rush. The retaining wall, an ominously vertical landmark to drivers passing under its bulk just north of the George Washington Bridge at 183rd Street in Washington Heights, shuddered and rumbled and fell in two stages that terrified nearby residents and drivers who saw landslides falling on the road ahead. The first, just before 3 p.m., was smaller and covered the parkway's Riverside Drive access road with rocky debris. The second, 5 to 10 minutes later, was a thunderous slide that buried the parkway's northbound lanes in a 150-foot-wide horseshoe-shaped mountain of boulders, soil and trees. It was unclear how long it might take to clear the debris and reopen the parkway and access roads. Earth-moving equipment was brought in, but officials said the northbound lanes of the parkway would be impassable through the weekend and perhaps longer. Carlos Pellecier, 45, a doorman at 1380 Riverside Drive, just south and to the side of the collapse, heard the ominous rumbles and felt the earth move. Firefighters arrived and one suggested that they all move back from the edge. Then it happened. ''It just went boom,'' Mr. Pellecier recalled. ''It was seconds, and everything just came down -- trees, benches, everything. You saw a tree coming down, flying through the air. We're running and you could see the cars get smashed.'' Three hours later, a fire on a railroad bridge in Kearny, N.J., shut down Amtrak and New Jersey Transit rail service between New York and Newark. It was unclear whether trains would be running in time for today's morning rush, railroad officials said. [Page B1.] In the slope of the landslide's debris, firefighters using thermal imaging devices detected no signs of heat, indicating that no people or cars whose engines had been running had been caught in the collapse. There were no reports of anyone missing and some witnesses said no cars had been passing when the wall fell, though a police officer said one car on the parkway was hit by debris but drove away. Two firefighters of Ladder Company 45 who responded to a call about the first collapse were standing at the base of the wall just before the second collapse. ''I was looking at the top of the wall and it was shaking,'' Firefighter Brian Masterson said. ''We were checking to see if anybody was in any of the cars, when we heard a rumbling,'' Firefighter Joe Byrne added. ''We were, like, let's go.'' About 250 residents of 1380 Riverside Drive were evacuated after cracks were found in the facade, but officials said the building was safe and all residents but those in north-facing apartments were allowed to return shortly before midnight. A spokesman for the Office of Emergency Management said the Red Cross provided shelter for four families. Hundreds of residents of Castle Village, a five-building cooperative atop the cliff, were not evacuated, and officials said that those buildings, some only 50 feet from the collapse, were being examined but did not seem in danger. For years, according to city officials, residents and engineering reports, the wall has been a collapse waiting to happen. Built nearly a century ago by a real estate developer, Charles V. Paterno, to create seven acres of level ground above the Hudson for his four-story castle, the wall in the 1980's underwent extensive repairs, but in recent years became a shifting, leaking mass in need of reinforcement. Chunks fell occasionally, leaving holes as big as a car. Water channels built into the wall to relieve pressure and channels cut by seepage, leaked often. Other repairs had been done in recent months, Sarah Morgridge, an aide to City Councilman Robert Jackson, a Manhattan Democrat, told The Associated Press. And recently, Castle Village, which owns the wall, hired an engineer to evaluate its structural integrity. The news was bad, residents and board members said. As a result, Langan Engineering, which had been brought in to work on the problem, asked the city's Department of Transportation for permits to close parts of the parkway to perform repairs. A meeting to discuss the permits was scheduled for today, and the work was to begin on Monday, city officials said. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other city officials said last night that the parts of the 1,000-foot-long wall that were still standing appeared to be sound, and that local residents and their buildings and drivers in the southbound parkway lanes were not in danger. ''It could have been a catastrophe, and it was not,'' Mr. Bloomberg, who surveyed the scene in a helicopter, said at a sunset news conference at the site. He noted that the collapse occurred before the heavy traffic of the evening rush, and that no gas, water or electrical lines were affected. ''I think we are very lucky,'' he added. Commissioner Iris Weinshall of the Department of Transportation said that an investigation would be needed to determine the cause of the collapse. But she and other officials said water seeping through the porous wall could have been a factor. The collapse halted northbound traffic on the parkway -- the main artery for commuters to New Jersey, Westchester County, Connecticut and points north and west -- and spillbacks rippled outward over the West Side, across the Bronx expressways and Manhattan's labyrinth of avenues, highways, tunnels and bridges. By late afternoon, outbound delays in the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels under the Hudson River ran an hour or more. But because the collapse occurred several blocks north of the George Washington Bridge, New Jersey-bound commuters, though delayed extensively, were able to reach and cross the bridge. Southbound parkway traffic, shut off for several hours, also resumed last night. Fire trucks, police cars and other emergency equipment were also caught in the tangled traffic, delaying hundreds of firefighters and police officers who were summoned from across the city in what the emergency management agency called a Level 3 mobilization, one below a citywide catastrophe. By 1:15 a.m., half of the debris from the parkway was cleared, although the access road remained buried. For many who saw views of the fallen wall on television, thoughts of terrorism leapt to mind, as they do whenever any major disruption occurs in New York. But city officials quickly indicated that terrorism had nothing to do with what happened. ''It's been leaning for years,'' said David Muhlfelder, 50, a writer whose apartment overlooks the collapse. ''I heard a big rumble. then I heard a second one a few minutes later. That really spooked me.'' The collapse just missed a pedestrian bridge. As helicopter cameras caught the sweep of the slide in the late afternoon, Channel 2, WCBS-TV, showed pictures of a huge bulge in the wall, taken recently. The television pictures also showed a shiny red car, its hood tucked into the southern edge of the debris. It was unoccupied and, aside from being half buried, appeared to be unscathed. It belonged to Ralph Frazier, 87, of Springfield Gardens, Queens, who said his daughter, of 1380 Riverside Drive, had parked it under the wall. ''I have it insured and my payments are paid up,'' Mr. Frazier said. ''So far so good. She didn't get hurt.'' Traffic Advisory The following detour is in effect until further notice: Northbound traffic on the Henry Hudson Parkway will be detoured to the Cross-Bronx Expressway ramp (eastbound 178th street). Traffic will be directed to Broadway, then left on Broadway north to Dyckman Street/Riverside Drive, then left on Riverside Drive before returning to the parkway. Northbound drivers are also encouraged to use the Franklin D. Roosevelt/Harlem River Drive to Dyckman Street. LANDSLIDE ON THE HIGHWAY: OVERVIEW"
"As officials from the Fire Department traveled in a Police Department helicopter to Upper Manhattan and the scene of a wall collapse yesterday, city officials pointed out the cooperation -- rather than antagonism -- between the two agencies. At a news conference near the collapse site, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said that all of the city's public safety agencies were working together. Comments from Joseph Bruno, the commissioner of the Office of Emergency Management, which coordinates the response of various city agencies at disasters; Nicholas Scoppetta, the fire commissioner; and Raymond W. Kelly, the police commissioner, reiterated the message. ''We have many agencies here,'' Mr. Bruno said. ''We're cooperating very nicely.'' Just three days earlier, the longstanding tension between the Police and Fire Departments was on display at a City Council hearing, where Peter E. Hayden, the city's highest-ranking fire official, criticized the city's new emergency response plan, saying it gave too much authority to the police in some emergencies. LANDSLIDE ON THE HIGHWAY"
"They were drawn from their apartment by the wonder and roar of falling rock and trees. But standing on a footbridge outside their apartment building at 1380 Riverside Drive, Elizabeth Umpierre and her cousin had only a moment to gaze at the landslide that buried the roadway below. A minute or two later, a firefighter grabbed them by the hair, and yelled at them to run as fast as they could. Suddenly, a second cascade of stone and trees washed down the hillside over cars and onto the Henry Hudson Parkway beneath their feet. ''We did not have time to think,'' said Ms. Umpierre, 24. ''We were like, 'Oh my God, what is happening?''' A few hours later, still dazed, she sat at the corner of West 181st Street and Riverside Drive, where she had been brought by the firefighter. As a precautionary measure, the 200 to 300 people in her building were evacuated for several hours while workers and engineers assessed the damaged wall next to their building. Later, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and city officials said that the building was stable, and residents were allowed to return. ''When all is said and done, people that live in these buildings will have gone through a minor inconvenience if they live in this one building, none if they lived in the other,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference. The collapse broke the late-afternoon routine in the 20-story apartment tower, which houses a mix of young newcomers and older longtime residents. Sona Kunter, 82, was watching television when the rumble began, and her roommate, Margaret Harrison, 83, was reading letters. Ms. Kunter thought the booming sounds must have been a truck hitting the footbridge, a common occurrence, but then firefighters began knocking on their door and escorted them out. Ms. Kunter and Ms. Harrison stuffed medicine into a plastic bag, along with a box of cookies, and ended up around the corner on the street, sitting on a black couch that a tenant in a neighboring building had dragged out for them, not far from where Ms. Umpierre leaned against the building wall. ''I am not really scared; I've been through worse,'' Ms. Harrison said. ''I've been through the war.'' Some residents said that over the past few years they had been worried about the wall after seeing dirt and stones tumble from it. Below the wall on Riverside Drive, scaffolding had been put up in an apparent attempt to block debris from hitting the roadway, residents said, though nobody had expected it to collapse. Now, those who live nearby said they found it hard to believe that their homes were next to a virtual rockslide, only yards away from refrigerator-size boulders spilling down the hill and onto the highway. As the evening waned and no reports of injuries emerged, the level of alarm receded. At an emergency shelter set up by the Red Cross at Public School 187 at West 187th Street, about 50 people gathered by 10 p.m. sipping beverages. A Red Cross spokeswoman said that by midnight all but 40 residents of 1380 Riverside Drive were allowed to return to the building. Earlier, others took the emergency in stride at the Hispaniola Restaurant on West 181st Street. ''It could have been worse,'' said Antonio Berroa, 41, as he sipped water and prepared to order something stronger. LANDSLIDE ON THE HIGHWAY: THE RESIDENTS"
"FROM an aesthetics standpoint, a standpoint that comes naturally to an urban and urbane London-educated architect who shed his green card only because regulations require New York City commissioners to be United States citizens, David J. Burney's workday took a sorry plummet from the sublime to the ridiculous last Thursday afternoon. Dirt, and lots of it, was the theme. One minute Mr. Burney, commissioner of the city's Department of Design and Construction, was settling in for a ribbon-cutting ceremony, with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg playing host, at a sophisticated greenhouse his agency helped design and build at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Splendor in the dirt. Then everybody's city-issued beepers signaled the news of the calamitous landslide caused by the collapse of the clifflike retaining wall framing the northbound side of the Henry Hudson Parkway at 183rd Street in Washington Heights. So much for flower-gazing: not an option with the parkway, and possibly drivers, buried by a barrage of boulders, dirt and debris. Mr. Burney and the mayor switched to emergency mode and hustled, separately, to the site. No glitches. No spats over which agency would lead. Once terrorism was ruled out -- ''It was clear this was no act of terrorism, this was an act of dirt,'' says Mr. Burney, tartly -- the police concentrated on traffic control; once it was determined there had been no casualties, the Fire Department's rescue and recovery effort ended. That's when Mr. Burney received the green light to take over the unromantic challenge of mopping up the mess. ''It's not what I went to architecture school for,'' admits Mr. Burney, 57, shyly holding court in his glum but spacious office at a former Chiclets gum factory in amenity-shy Long Island City. (Even commissioners partial to Paul Smith ties, Donna Karan suits, and Barneys warehouse sales don't get to pick the borough where they are based.) Mr. Burney found out his first day here that the lease on the gum factory would run for an additional 17 years. Sigh. Fortunately the job provides ample diversion, much of it off-site, some of it, as in Washington Heights, round-the-clock. To his horror, the promotion to lead agency at the landslide came with a mayoral mandate to stabilize the ruined wall and make the parkway passable for the Monday morning rush. ''I said to myself, 'Oh no, did he really say that?''' he recalls. MR. BLOOMBERG sure did. ''Let's just say he got me all the shovels I needed,'' says Mr. Burney, a fan of the mayor's. ''Bloomberg is probably the first mayor since Lindsay to emphasize design quality'' and make it a mission to raise the standard of public works citywide, he says. Any pressure? ''The way to get fired from this job is not getting the Henry Hudson Parkway open for Monday morning.'' Since Mr. Burney likes the commissionership to which Mr. Bloomberg appointed him in 2004, he convened his troops, many of them veterans of the torturous cleanup at ground zero, and with help and trucks from several city agencies got the roadway cleared of 40,000 cubic yards of detritus. Even beat the deadline. ''Of course it was different from 9/11, but we faced exactly the same issues of debris management: in a sense it could have been any three days at ground zero,'' he says. ''I was standing on the pedestrian bridge at 10:18 p.m. Sunday night when the first car drove through.'' To cheers. Then he went home to the brownstone in Carroll Gardens where he lives with his wife, Jennifer Nobis, an architect he met when both worked at Davis Brody (he was project manager for Zeckendorf Towers on Union Square and the Rose Building at Lincoln Center) and their two children. He has lived in Brooklyn since 1985 and likens it to London, where he earned his master's in architecture at the University of London. ''I got the New York bug in 1982, moved here and met an American girl, and now I've got two kids, a mortgage, a dog and I'll never see England again: I'm from Brooklyn now.'' Not that he's housebound. ''I did fill another of life's ambitions last year, saw the Taj Mahal. I'd already been to Egypt and seen the Pyramids, any architect's dream, so now I can die in peace.'' If Mr. Burney's sense of humor skews dark, it may come from growing up in Liverpool, a sooty, industrial burg where, he recalls, ''I'd walk to school with a scarf wrapped around my face to keep the smog out.'' His father taught mechanical engineering; the family also lived in Manchester and Karachi, Pakistan, before ending up, when Mr. Burney was 14, in Edinburgh. It was his first glimpse of an urban garden spot, and it propelled him into architecture. Mr. Burney spent more than a dozen years at the city's Housing Authority as director of design and capital improvement and is the first architect to run the Department of Design and Construction, the sprawling agency that is perhaps the city's ultimate multitasker. It is charged with managing $4 billion in capital projects (courts, libraries, police and fire stations are among its 600 projects) but is also responsible for debris management at disaster sites like ground zero. The department received considerable attention during that cleanup after the previous commissioner, Kenneth R. Holden, finagled access for an Atlantic Monthly writer whose articles chronicled a culture of anti-cooperation among police, firefighters and construction workers and implied that firefighters had stashed stolen jeans from a Trade Center Gap store in their truck. Mr. Burney is an unlikely candidate for similar attention. ''We like to have happy, content clients and no publicity,'' he says. PUBLIC LIVES"
"A day after a landslide destroyed or damaged almost 50 houses here and forced 1,000 residents to flee, hundreds began to return Thursday evening to homes that remained intact. Earlier, dozens of residents crowded into the City Council chambers and demanded to know when life might return to normal. The city manager, Ken Frank, tried to be reassuring, but the facts spoke for themselves. ''Some of you, you've got your houses down the hill,'' he told the packed room. ''You're not going to get in now. You're not going to get in for months.'' The owners of 22 houses considered in most cases to be beyond saving were ushered into a separate conference room to be told the bad news. One of those was Tim Saunders, whose home of eight years on Flamingo Road was heavily damaged. He was wearing the same clothes he wore on Wednesday, and he was trying to figure out his next move. The first order of business for him and his girlfriend, Sherry Way, was to find temporary housing, and then, a new place to live. ''We'd like to stay,'' he said, ''but after this, our days in Laguna may be numbered. The speculation is, we're high and dry. I've got a big mortgage and no house.'' Each of the 22 houses worst damaged -- some fell 100 feet or more -- now bears a red tag, declaring it off limits for the time being. An additional 26 houses have been yellow-tagged, which indicates that they are safe enough to enter for a limited time during the day. Each house's future will be determined on a case-by-case basis, the city manager said. Even a red tag could be flexible. ''It doesn't mean your house is destroyed or can't be saved,'' Mr. Frank said. At some point in the next few days, he said, owners of some of those houses might be able to enter the structures, under supervision, to collect a few essential belongings. There was good news, though, for some people on Thursday. Of the 329 houses affected by the evacuation order, the city manager said, 264 could be reoccupied starting Thursday evening. The announcement put in motion a reverse migration into Bluebird Canyon, where the slide occurred early Wednesday. To avoid bottlenecks on the narrow canyon roads, city officials urged returning homeowners to wait a day or so. At the City Hall meeting, an official said service might not be restored to most houses in the area until the weekend. Residents were told to boil water before using it. They were also told that mail deliveries would resume almost immediately and that school buses would be back service in the area on Monday. Before the City Hall meeting, Peggy Wolff, 40, said she was eager to return to the undamaged Bluebird Canyon home that she shared with her husband and two young children. While relieved that her home was safe, she said she was also saddened. ''Everywhere I go around town,'' she said, ''I see the people who lost their homes, and my heart really wrenches for them.'' Christine Fugate, 41, a documentary filmmaker, said that although the slide damaged three houses down the street from the house her family purchased on Meadowlark Lane last year, there was no way she, her husband, Jeff Jacobs, 39, and their two young children were leaving. ''I'm willing to go back without utilities, as long as it's safe,'' she said, ''I love living there. I just want to be in our house. After living in L.A. for 14 years, this is my dream home. I used to love disaster movies when I was in high school. I must have seen 'Earthquake' eight times. But I don't think I'll be able to watch them anymore without breaking out in a sweat and feeling ill.'' Ms. Fugate said her children, Caterina, 4, and Sara Jean, 3, ''were really suffering.'' ''They don't understand,'' she said. ''They saw the houses fall, and Caterina keeps saying, 'Our house is broke.''' She added that the family would stay in their new home no matter what. ''My family back in Kentucky thinks we're all nuts living here,'' she said. ''My husband was like, 'That's it, we're moving to Kansas,' and I said, 'Yeah, then the locusts will come and a tornado will hit.''' For some, the latest disaster is a haunting reminder of disasters past. ''It's déj_ vu all over again,'' said Bing Boka, a retired captain in the Laguna Beach Fire Department, who worked a landslide here in 1978 that destroyed or damaged at least 50 houses. He also helped fight several major wildfires here. ''Slides are not that rare in this town,'' said Mr. Boka, a native son who retired in 1997 after 26 years on the job. ''Laguna is not unlike Santa Barbara, or San Clemente, or Los Angeles, but you don't see the amount of disasters there that you do here. Maybe it's just a dark cloud over the place.'' Pausing on Oriole Drive after returning to his home last night, Walter Viszolay, 56, motioned to the view of the ocean, including Catalina Island. ''This is the view everybody lives here for,'' he said. ''You've got Catalina in the background over there, and the beautiful sun setting over there.'' Mr. Viszolay said the return to his four-bedroom home on Meadowlark Lane with his son, Eli, 13, daughter, Marissa, 17, and his wife, Kelly, 46, was bittersweet. ''I'm glad I have my home,'' he said, ''but I'm really sorry for the people who lost theirs. It's a lot of my neighbors and a lot of my friends.''"
"A wide swath of hillside, packed with expensive houses and weakened by winter rains, collapsed here early on Wednesday, sending homes, garages and cars plummeting down the slope and their inhabitants screaming into the streets. Some people fled down the cactus-covered slope in bare feet, trying to outrun the falling hill. Miraculously, no one was seriously hurt. Four people -- two of them children -- were sent to hospitals, while about 1,000 were evacuated from 350 homes in bucolic Bluebird Canyon, southeast of downtown Laguna Beach. Seventeen houses, some worth $1 million or more, were lost; another 11 were damaged, some seriously; and 20 others were considered threatened. Residents said they awoke to the sound of cracking and popping, most likely the rumble of foundations shifting. ''I heard this crackle, and thought it was birds on the roof,'' said Donna Kilgore, a 19-year resident of the canyon. ''The cats were scared -- they were clawing and scratching. The neighbors came out and said, 'Our house is moving.' That's when panic set in. I got my jeans and grabbed some jewelry.'' Within seconds, she said, her three-bedroom house had shifted so that she could no longer open the kitchen door. She tried the front door; that too was stuck. The windows started breaking. ''That's when I got really scared,'' said Ms. Kilgore, a retired property manager. She managed to get out of the house through a sliding glass door. Accompanied by neighbors, she scrambled down a 53-step staircase on the hill, she said, and then through broken earth. ''These people were just as petrified as I was,'' said Ms. Kilgore, who lost her shoes and ripped her pants during the descent. Her eyes teared as she thought of her two cats, Nefertiti and Tigertail, who remained unaccounted for on Wednesday afternoon. As she spoke, she pointed to her house way up on the hill, its roofline dipped at a weird angle. Nearby, some houses had slid as much as 100 feet. ''It's Mother Nature, and she doesn't care,'' Ms. Kilgore said. ''It's a risk you take when you live on a hillside.'' A statement from the United States Geological Survey on Wednesday ascribed the landslide here to winter rains -- which led to the second-wettest season on record in Southern California -- ''percolating downward through the soil.'' But some residents of Bluebird Canyon attributed the latest landslide, at least partly, to a single house, an uninhabited, 5,000-square-foot structure known as the Sinatra house, which they said was named after a former owner. Residents said that the house, which has been under construction for four or five years, was too big for the hill, and that it had been constructed with pilings that did not penetrate the slope's bedrock. When the house shifted, they said, the rest of the hill came down with it. Kirk A. Nelson, a builder and architectural designer whose 1948-vintage house overlooks the canyon but was unaffected by the slide, said he had studied the wreckage of the Sinatra house's retaining walls early Wednesday and concluded that the caissons had not been driven into the bedrock. ''It's a combination of things,'' Mr. Nelson said, referring to the possible cause of the slide. ''It's the volume of water and the fact that that house has not been stable since the beginning.'' Another resident, Julie Swain, whose house was also saved, said she looked across Bluebird Canyon Creek at the bottom of her garden as she heard the hill rumbling and saw debris falling from beneath the driveway of the Sinatra house. ''There were big chunks of earth, rocks and trees coming at us,'' said Ms. Swain, a lawyer for the Orange County government. ''It was just surreal, the earth coming down. It just didn't seem like it would happen.'' Several of Ms. Swain's neighbors were not so lucky. Just a few houses away on Bluebird Canyon Drive, two homes were virtually destroyed, and two others showed extensive damage. At one, the front door remained ajar, a testament to the speed of the inhabitants' departure; a half-eaten cracker lay on a bench outside; on the ground by the door, a child's toppled drinking glass, a flashlight, a discarded toy. The landslide here was an echo of familiar events on the fragile coast of California. On Jan. 10, in La Conchita, just east of Santa Barbara, 10 people were killed when a landslide enveloped 15 houses there. Other houses were damaged by winter landslides in Malibu, Glendale and Los Angeles. Laguna Beach, a picturesque oceanfront town where real estate prices have skyrocketed in recent years, has been hit by a series of disasters. In October 1978, a slide in Bluebird Canyon wrecked as many as 50 homes. Most were rebuilt. In 1998, another landslide here killed two people and damaged 300 houses, only five years after a wildfire destroyed about 400 homes. In February, the authorities declared several houses uninhabitable after the earth beneath them became saturated with rain. At a Red Cross evacuation center at Laguna Beach High School, one of the first arrivals was a neighbor of Ms. Swain, John Gustafson, 54, an ultrasound technician. He lived in a 1950's-era, two-bedroom house along the base of Bluebird Canyon. The slide, he said, came without warning and pushed through the back of the house, destroying a backyard garden that had taken 21 years to create. ''I heard a crack on the back deck,'' said Mr. Gustafson, ''and thought, What was going on? Then I saw the land come down like a wave.'' Mr. Gustafson said that in 1993, he had taken out a sizable mortgage to remodel the home. Now, though, his insurance was unlikely to cover its destruction, he said. With scratched, mud-covered legs, Jill Lockhart, 35, stood on Flamingo Road, just below the ruined four-bedroom house she and her husband, Bobby, bought eight years ago for $380,000 and until today was probably worth $2 million. Ms. Lockhart said she was just beginning her day at 6:45 a.m. when she heard popping and cracking all over her home. ''I'll never forget that sound,'' she said. ''All the glass breaking. It's just like you imagine your home would be getting hit by a wrecking ball. And then I thought, my house is sliding. I grabbed my 2-year-old and ran upstairs and grabbed my 4-year-old. We ran out into the street, and it was chaos. The street was just buckling. ''I grabbed my kids and said, 'We've got to run down the front of the mountain.''' Her husband, Bobby Lockhart, said his immediate concerns were the family cat, photos and a collection of 400 vintage surfboards that he said was worth about a half-million dollars. One, he said, dated to the 1930's. ''I have surfboards up there,'' he said, ''that are one of a kind. Everything we have is in that house. All I have right now is my wallet.'' ''I'll definitely rebuild in Laguna,'' he added. ''But I don't think we'll ever live on a hill again.''"
"It is, of course, an optical illusion, but it does seem that every time you pick up the newspaper or turn on the TV, an entire hillside of Southern California houses is sliding into the highway or gully below. What isn't illusory is the plain fact that people who ought to know better by now -- the homeowners, the builders, the local officials who write the zoning laws -- have yet to learn that nature does not play by man's rules, that unless humans set limits on development, nature will. So it was with the fires that raged from Ventura County southward to the Mexican border in the fall of 2003, devastating suburban houses that had foolishly been built too deep into the foothills and canyons where the fires took hold. And so it was with last week's mudslide in Bluebird Canyon in Laguna Beach, a lovely town whose hills rise swiftly from the Pacific, and where, on Wednesday, a wide swath of hillside weakened by winter rains collapsed in a roar, sending homes, garages and cars plunging to the bottom of the canyon. Fortunately, only property values were hurt. Laguna Beach was spared the fate of La Conchita, another Southern California town just east of Santa Barbara, where 10 people were crushed to death in another landslide in January that destroyed or damaged more than 30 houses in the village below. But these and similar calamities in other parts of the world -- Haiti, Colombia, the Mississippi flood plain -- spring from the same source, namely the belief that we can continue to overload the landscape without paying a price. This sense of careless optimism is particularly strong in California, to which Americans by the hundreds of thousands continue to migrate every year, filling the vanishing hillsides with still more new houses. A historical note: There was another slide in Bluebird Canyon, in 1978, that wrecked as many as 50 homes. Nearly all were rebuilt. Editorial"
"A mammoth chunk of ice split from a glacier in the Caucasus Mountains and swept downhill late Friday, leaving perhaps 100 people dead and a 12-mile trail of devastation across roads, rivers and at least one village in southwestern Russia. About 500 rescue workers were searching for survivors today, and officials said the missing included the 27 members of a film crew led by one of Russia's most popular directors and actors. They said there was no firm estimate of the number of people who might have been carried away in the avalanche because the area is popular with mountain climbers and hikers. But Mikhail Shatalov, a senior official in the North Ossetia region where the disaster occurred, told the Itar-Tass news agency that the death toll could reach 100. Aerial views of the disaster area broadcast tonight on Russian television showed a broad river of black mud and debris settled over the otherwise green landscape at the mountains' base. ''The tragedy in North Ossetia is a very grave catastrophe,'' President Vladimir V. Putin said in Moscow. ''What counts now is to find the missing people and restore the structure for supplying the region.'' Officials quoted by the Interfax news agency said the huge Maili glacier, in the Caucasus peaks on Russia's border with Georgia, had shed a slice of ice up to 100 million cubic feet in size and as much as 330 feet thick. The glacier broke into house-size chunks as it slid downhill, felling trees, triggering mudslides and blocking at least one river, which threatened to cause floods. Reuters said the slide clipped one village, Karmadon, burying homes where about 30 people lived. The number of survivors was not known. Near Gizel, another village, ''we thought that water was pouring down,'' Reuters quoted one resident, Elbrus Doyev, as saying. ''When it had all stopped, we came out of our houses and saw huge pieces of ice.'' Officials said at least 15 people had been found alive, and nearby tourist centers housing another 60 had been evacuated. Crews were working to bring supplies to two villages that were cut off when the avalanche blocked roads with a six-foot layer of mud and ice. Among those reported missing were two border guards and a film crew led by Sergei Bodrov Jr., the director of the wildly popular films ''Brother'' and ''Brother 2,'' about a man who metes out his own brand of justice in the Russia of the lawless 1990's, and later in the United States. Mr. Bodrov's crew was shooting a movie near the glacier and contacted co-workers outside the avalanche zone about 20 minutes before the disaster. The crew has not been heard from since, a spokesman for the film company told Moscow's news radio station Echo Moskvy."
"Nearly 6,000 feet up the Caucasus Mountains last Friday evening, Sergei Bodrov Jr., Russia's hottest young movie star, had wrapped up the second day of shooting on his latest film and was preparing to descend to the flatlands. Three cameramen and a driver, impatient for the weekend to start, were the first to leave in their minivan. ''They decided not to wait,'' Aleksei Ternovsky, the senior administrator for the film, said in a telephone interview today. ''When they went down, the rest of the crew was already in their cars.'' But the stragglers, led by the 30-year-old Mr. Bodrov, never made it to the bottom. Within minutes, an immense glacier, severed from the mountain near its 15,700-foot peak, roared through the nearby hillside village of Karmadon, burying much of it in up to 500 feet of ice and debris. The disaster was the latest in a summer-long string of catastrophes that have all but turned Ivans into Jobs. Rescuers have found 27 survivors and 8 bodies, few of them identified, and at least 95 people are missing. But ordinary Russians had eyes only for Mr. Bodrov, who streaked to fame as the star of two shoot-em-ups that struck a deep chord in people made helpless by the lawlessness and chaos of the mid-1990's. ''Only a miracle could save him from the avalanche,'' screamed a headline on the front page of today's issue of the Moscow daily Gazeta. A color photograph of Mr. Bodrov, clad in a windbreaker, took up a quarter of the page. Rescue workers were reported to have recovered the bodies of two other crew members by this evening, three days after the catastrophe. If Mr. Bodrov also died, as seems likely, it is unclear when his body might be found. Emergency officials were considering tonight whether to curtail or call off what has become a fruitless hunt for survivors. Today Russian television broadcast new scenes of devastation from the landslide, which began when roughly one-third of the Maili glacier -- three million tons of ice, by one estimate -- split from a Caucasus peak and plowed 10 miles down a mountain gorge. Videotape showed rescuers hacking with hand tools at huge ice blocks, and towns inundated by floods from melting ice and debris-blocked streams. An official of the federal emergencies ministry said the tongue of black mud and ice averaged 17 to 33 feet deep and 175 feet wide. ''It's a very complicated situation,'' the official said in an interview. ''The 468 rescuers, both local and brought from Moscow, have everything necessary and are doing their utmost.'' For Russia, this has been a summer to forget. About 70 people, many of them children, died in May after rebels bombed a military parade in Dagestan, also in southern Russia. Another 154 Russians -- again, many of them young -- died in a midair collision over Germany in July. And 119 perished last month after a grossly overloaded military helicopter crashed in Chechnya, apparently after being hit by a rebel missile. Scientists speculated today that global warming might have set off this latest and most bizarre of the tragedies. But Russia's ceaseless conspiracy mill quickly produced speculation that Chechen militants had split the glacier apart -- or that the film crew had caused the disaster by using explosives during filming. In fact, the film was being shot thousands of feet below the glaciers. The ice and debris tumbled through a spot above the village of Karmadon where the crew had been packing equipment for transport. If Mr. Bodrov was swept up in the landslide, Russia will have lost its most celebrated and versatile young actor, albeit not -- in some critics' view -- its most skillful. The son of an eminent Russian film director who now lives in the United States, Mr. Bodrov got his start on Russian television, as a talk show host, in the early 1990's. He gained fame in 1996, starring in an antiwar film directed by his father, ''Prisoner of the Caucasus'' (called ''Prisoner of the Mountains'' when it was released in the United States the next year), which was nominated for an Academy Award. But he became a matinee idol in 1997, when he played the lead role in ''Brother,'' a middle-brow film about a naïve yet bloodless young man who follows a beloved older brother into the contract-killing business after fighting in Chechnya. With its twin themes of enduring loyalty and vigilante justice, ''Brother'' became a sensation in a nation weary of the every-man-for-himself mantra of post-Soviet Russia. Mr. Bodrov became even more popular after the sequel, ''Brother 2,'' in which his character mowed down American mafiosi to rescue a Chechnya war veteran in trouble. In 2000, Mr. Bodrov played a leading role in a second Oscar-nominated film, ''East-West,'' in which the French director, Regis Wargnier, told the story of Russian exiles who returned to the Soviet Union after World War II only to suffer Stalin's persecution. Before embarking on his latest film, Mr. Bodrov returned to television as the host of the Russian version of the international game-show hit ''Survivor.'' ''He's an actor who, perhaps, is not very talented, but he's quite exact in expressing the expectations of young Russia,'' Daniil B. Dondurei, chief editor of Moscow's Cinema Art magazine, said in an interview. ''He's an ideal type. And that's more important than an actor's skill.'' The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda adapted an old Russian saying to sum up the actor's hold on the Russian psyche. ''Putin is our president,'' the newspaper wrote, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin. ''Sergei Bodrov is our brother.''"
"One after the other, 42 snowboarders launched themselves off the shoulder of Mount Shuksan in a silent salute to a fallen pioneer of their sport, Craig Kelly, 36, who was killed in an avalanche last month. But high above them, in the untracked snow of the North Cascades, other snowboarders were perched at the intersection of risk and stupidity, preparing stunts that even Mr. Kelly might not have tried. The snowboarders had been warned of death by avalanche, and beyond -- ''you or your heirs will be charged for rescue,'' the Forest Service signs said. Still, they dropped into the snow chutes, setting off small slides, yells of thrill echoing in the canyons. ''Craig Kelly was a hero to all of us, but his death seems to be just part of the game,'' said Shane Drexler, 26, a snowboarder who once nearly died in an avalanche but is still drawn to deep, unstable snow. The game -- courting avalanches, pushing into the highest, untracked reaches of snowbound mountains -- has of late turned particularly deadly. Last winter, 35 Americans died in back-country avalanches, the most ever. The previous high was 33 in the winter before. Over the past decade, avalanche deaths have risen, mostly among snowmobile riders, but more and more snowboarders and back-country downhill skiers have also died. The numbers this season are slightly below record level. But in the past month, two avalanches have killed a total of 14 people in British Columbia, including one that claimed Mr. Kelly, who did things on a snowboard that once were unimaginable. Three other Americans died in the avalanche that buried Mr. Kelly. So far this winter, 15 Americans and 16 Canadians have died. Despite a a weather pattern from El Niño that has delivered snow than usual to the West, most experts do not blame the elements. An avalanche, they say, is the only natural disaster that is usually set off by victims. What has changed is human behavior in the mountains. ''When I started looking at avalanches 25 years ago, the only people you'd see in the back country were the rare telemark skiers, and those people were thought to be real weirdos,'' said Bruce Tremper, director of the United States Forest Service's Utah Avalanche Center. ''The conventional wisdom was you don't go into the back country in winter.'' But just this weekend, Mr. Tremper estimated, more than 2,000 people in the Salt Lake City area alone ventured into the wilderness by snowmobile, skis or snowboard. They were all seeking the same thing: a slope with untouched snow. In the 1970's, Colorado had ''ski to die'' clubs, skiers who tried to make tracks in places that made most people's hearts stop on sight. Since then, the toys and the challenges have changed considerably, inspired in part by a subculture that celebrates extreme sport and gravity defiance in all its contortions. ''Now we've got some people actually trying to cause avalanches,'' said Mr. Tremper, who spends his mornings examining snow stability to put into a daily avalanche report. ''It's a sport.'' Mr. Tremper recently spotted a bumper sticker on a truck bound for Utah's back country. ''On the edge for you is the middle of the road for me,'' it read. For snowmobilers, the sport is called high-marking. The object is to ride as high as possible on a steep, typically untouched flank of snow. ''It's a lot of fun,'' said Darin Bryant, a Seattle snowboarder and snowmobiler. ''But stuff happens.'' The records of avalanche deaths this year complied by the Colorado Avalanche Information Center, which tracks North American avalanches, show the kind of accidents that follow people who hunt for unsteady snow. The center's listings from this month include the death of a snowmobiler in the Crazy Mountains near Livingston, Mont. It is just one of many: ''One snowmobiler caught, buried, killed. Two snowboarders caught and buried, one rescued, one killed. One solo snowboarder caught, buried, and killed.'' Here in Washington, more people die in avalanches -- 15 since 1996 -- than in any other natural disaster, according to the federal Northwest Weather and Avalanche Center in Seattle. ''We're killing more people in avalanches every year than die in wildfires or floods,'' said Mark Moore, director of the avalanche center. ''And a lot of those people, they're out there looking for the very slope that's mostly likely to come down in an avalanche.'' Just above this village near the Canadian border, weekend snow warriors carry battery-powered beacons that send out a locating signal, snow shovels and even balloons that inflate to take a victim above the snow. But the tools can provide a false sense of security. ''It's not a talisman to have all these tools,'' Mr. Moore said. The flip side of caution is the joy that comes from leaving the bonds of earth, even for a few seconds. All over Mount Baker last weekend, snowboarders wore T-shirts reading, ''Craig Kelly is my co-pilot.'' Mr. Kelly, known as a ''snow rat'' from his early days on the slopes of Mount Baker, dominated the world circuit of snowboarding in the late 1980's and early 1990's, while pioneering numerous airborne stunts. Mr. Drexler, as did many other snowboarders, worshiped Mr. Kelly. But he has learned the hard way that untracked snow can be deadly. Two years ago he and a friend tried to snowboard down an out-of-bounds ski area near Alpental, a resort in the central Cascades, when he was caught in a fast-moving slide. ''I held onto this tree, but the avalanche pulled me away,'' Mr. Drexler said. ''All of sudden, I'm like, whoa, I'm coughing, my goggles are clogged, this cloud of snow is carrying me down. I did everything I could to stay on top of it, and I lucked out.'' Now Mr. Drexler is a changed man -- to a degree. He carries a beacon that transmits a signal allowing people to find him if he is buried. But he has not followed through on plans to take a class on avalanche safety. ''Yeah, I should be taking the class,'' said Mr. Drexler, as he prepared for a snowboard run at the Mount Baker Ski Area near Glacier, about three hours north of Seattle. When snowboarders and skiers arrive at Mount Baker, the first thing they see is a sign boasting that the resort owns the United States record for most snowfall in a single season -- 1,140 inches, in the winter of 1998-99. That kind of snow draws risk-takers, but it also takes its toll. During that record winter, three people died in avalanches near here. ''We have a strict policy on out-of-bounds skiing and boarding, but people see these videos, these magazines, these stunts, and it just draws them in,'' said Duncan Howat, general manager of the Mount Baker Ski Area. ''People wonder what Craig Kelly must have felt during his last minutes alive -- I know, because I was buried once,'' Mr. Howat said. ''All I could think was how stupid this was. How I was never going to see my wife and two daughters again, and it was all because of this stupid act.'' Classes in avalanche safety are packed, ski operators say. Yet even with the high death toll in recent winters, there are few calls for restrictions. ''I don't think it's appropriate to restrict access to public land,'' said Mr. Tremper of the Utah Avalanche Center. ''We all own it. It's our greatest heritage. And instead of being locked up, as some antienvironmentalists say, it's the opposite -- it's total freedom.'' Most avalanche deaths occur on public land outside designated skiing and snowboarding areas. ''Snowboarders are an independent group,'' Mr. Moore said. ''They don't want to be told where to go or what to do. They want to go places where the avalanche lives.''"
"Craig Kelly, who played a major role in making snowboarding a modern-day sport and then a recreational outlet, died on Monday in an avalanche that killed seven skiers and snowboarders near Revelstoke, British Columbia. He was 36 and lived in Nelson, British Columbia. He was among 21 people who had gone to ski the Durrand Glacier when a wall of snow about 100 feet wide and 330 feet long came down. Kelly, who grew up in Mount Vernon, Wash., won three overall and four freestyle titles in the world snowboarding championships and three United States Open titles. Snowboarding is essentially surfing on the snow while wearing soft boots. Snowboarding competition started in 1975, and Kelly turned professional at 18. It became a Winter Olympic sport in 1998, soon after he stopped competing. ''Craig played a huge role in making it a sport,'' said Jake Burton of Burlington, Vt., his main sponsor. Kelly also changed the nature of the sport. His overall world championships required competition in both freestyle (tricks up and down steep walls) and giant slalom (like the Alpine skiing variety). ''He took the sport from competition into freestyle only, and the whole industry basically followed him,'' Burton said. ''Then he took it to free riding, which isn't competition, and the industry followed him there. Now if you pick up a snowboarding magazine, you'll see 90 percent of it devoted to free riding rather than competition. He was restless, but he always seemed a step ahead.'' Kelly was introduced to snowboarding in 1981. As his father, Pat Kelly, said: ''He had won several national titles on BMX bikes. His bike sponsor took him to a mountain to try an early snowboard that you steered with ropes, and he was hooked.'' In addition to his father, Kelly is survived by his companion, Savina Findlay; their daughter, Olivia; his mother, Janet Hansen of Redmond, Wash.; two brothers, Brian of Bellingham, Wash., and Josh of Mount Vernon; and two sisters, Gilliam Kelly of Kent, Wash., and Jessica Hansen of Redmond. Kelly's income in recent years came largely from still and motion-picture projects involving snowboarding. That pleased him, he said last year, because the worst thing about competing around the world was ''unproductive downtime that makes me feel real silly for being away from my family.''"
"Eight back-packing American sky mountaineers on helicopter tours of the jagged Selkirk Mountains of western Canada were buried and killed today by an avalanche, according to local officials. Two others were injured. The slide of ice and snow occurred about 20 miles northeast of the town of Revelstoke near the Durand Glacier where the skiers were dropped by helicopters, Bob Pearce, a spokesman for the British Columbia Ambulance Service, told reporters. The victims were members of several groups, including an estimated 20 skiers, who were caught in the avalanche during a particularly windy and freezing morning. The names of the victims and survivors were not immediately released. The survivors were taken to Revelstoke Hospital, where one was reported in stable condition. The condition of a second injured skier was not immediately known. The skiers were on tours organized by Selkirk Mountain Experience, a company based in Revelstoke that has been ranked as a top adventure tourism outfit by several prominent periodicals. Local officials said the slide had not been forecast, although avalanche conditions were rated as hazardous. This has been a particularly cold winter through much of Canada, but a relatively small amount of snow has fallen in southeastern British Columbia Province this year. That being the case, local officials said, the risk of a serious avalanche appeared minimal when the skiers set out early this morning. An estimated 50 people have been killed in snow slides in the rugged province of British Columbia in the past five years."
"AS ski season approaches, ski resorts and other organizations across the country have begun stepping up their backcountry education and avalanche safety initiatives. For good reason: a lot more people are heading out into the backcountry on their skis, ratcheting up both the excitement and the danger factors. In the 2002-3 season the number of avalanche fatalities in North America reached a record, 58. Half of those were backcountry skiers and snowboarders, including a group of high school students on a class trip, experienced backcountry guides, and a world champion snowboarder, according to the Forest Service National Avalanche Center. (The others killed included climbers, snowmobilers, hikers and snowshoers.) Last season, there were 32 fatalities, 10 of them involving skiers and snowboarders. ''In the last two decades, backcountry skiing and snowboarding has definitely been growing,'' said Craig Dostie, publisher of Couloir, a backcountry adventure magazine based in Truckee, Calif. ''The sport used to have the reputation that you had to be an extreme skier to go into the backcountry, but now it's the cool thing to do, adventure-wise. There's of course the avalanche danger, which is unpredictable, and it can certainly kill you whether or not you are prepared.'' Those who go out of bounds near a ski area can often be less experienced and less likely to recognize the dangers of unstable snow. Thus, the ski industry is responding with education programs designed to heighten awareness and minimize the risk. At Kirkwood Mountain Resort near Lake Tahoe, Calif., the dramatic popularity of the resort's out-of-bounds areas led to the creation of the Expedition Kirkwood program last year. More than 100 guests signed up last season for backcountry awareness clinics, avalanche beacon training sessions, and Sno-Cat skiing tours and hikes that focus on backcountry safety. Beacon Basin is an avalanche-training facility at Kirkwood run in partnership with Backcountry Access, which makes snow safety equipment. Participants are taught how to use avalanche beacons to locate a buried skier or rider. Eleven avalanche transmitters are permanently buried in a snowfield for beacon users to practice location skills. Training at Beacon Basin is also part of daylong backcountry awareness courses, which are offered monthly and focus on learning about snow conditions, risk assessment and safety procedures. Expedition Kirkwood's programs range from two hours to two days. Outside a resort's boundaries, skiers and riders have to depend on their own knowledge and snow safety skills, said Tracy Miller, a Kirkwood spokeswoman. ''The backcountry terrain outside Kirkwood's boundaries is very steep -- Class A avalanche terrain -- but unlike the resort, there is no snow safety work performed,'' she said. ''For the most technical skier or rider, it can be treacherous. For the inexperienced, it can be deadly.'' Many resorts offer avalanche and backcountry awareness sessions during the National Ski Area Association's National Safety Awareness Week, Jan. 15 to 21. The ski areas include Beaver Creek and Breckenridge, both in Colorado, and Big Mountain, Mont., which uses an avalanche-rescue-dog program called Powder Hounds to attract younger skiers and snowboarders. ''We try to teach people the basic knowledge of traveling in the backcountry, including route selection, equipment use, weather effects on the snowpack, and how to proceed in your group safely once you've decided to descend,'' said Addy McCord, patrol director at Beaver Creek. ''Always watch your partner, always have an escape route, things like that.'' On Feb. 5, Arapahoe Basin, Colo., will hold its third annual Beacon Bowl and Avalanche Awareness Day, which invites participants to test the latest avalanche gear and to attend clinics; there is also a time trial competition to find a buried avalanche beacon; all proceeds benefit the Colorado Avalanche Information Center. Other areas offering programs are Snowbird in Utah; Summit in Snoqualmie, Wash; Squaw Valley in California; and Telluride in Colorado, which in its annual three-day Telluride Avalanche School (Jan. 3 to 5 this season) gives students American Avalanche Association Level 1 certification. ''When you look at all the avalanche accidents, especially the recent accidents, you have about half knowing what they're doing, but the other half just don't know anything -- they're completely uneducated and bumble into a dangerous situation,'' said Bruce Tremper, director of the Forest Service Utah Avalanche Center, which teaches dozens of avalanche courses each season. Last year, three young snowboarders died in an avalanche near Aspen Grove in Utah. This month, the Utah Avalanche Center joined with the online gear retailer Backcountry.com and other partners in an avalanche safety campaign geared to school-age children and young adults, called Know Before You Go. The program includes a narrated video with extensive footage of avalanches, local avalanche professionals telling stories about close calls or accidents they have experienced, and presentations on basic avalanche signs and safety practices. The program will begin in Utah schools, but will be used as a model for mountain communities across the country. ''What's happened over the course of the last 10 years is that the gear and the technology far outpace people's avalanche skills,'' said Craig Gordon, an avalanche forecaster and director of the Know Before You Go program. ''So they're able to get out into the conditions, but then they don't know how to handle themselves or recognize basic instabilities. That's where the danger is.'' Those who venture off piste should have proper backcountry safety equipment with them and know how to use it, said Greer Terry, communications coordinator for Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. ''Our backcountry is one of the primary things that the resort is known for,'' Ms. Terry said. ''Our open-gate policy means that there are actual gates around our perimeter. There are warning sounds telling you that you are leaving the patrolled area, indicating the avalanche danger for the day, and if you choose to, you can go out of the gates and access over 3,000 acres of amazing terrain. But once you leave the resort, it's hike to and hike out, and you're on your own, so it's important that people know what they're doing.''
