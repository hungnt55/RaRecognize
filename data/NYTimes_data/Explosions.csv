"The government issued an ultimatum today to the rebels who occupy the hills above this city, ordering them to surrender or withdraw in 24 hours, or face being wiped out. A guerrilla commander called by Reuters said the rebels would ignore the deadline. ''Morale is high, our ammunition is plentiful, and casualties are light,'' the commander said by telephone from the hills. The government made its statement hours after the army had begun an intensive offensive against the rebels, who are ethnic Albanians, using tanks and artillery for the first time in the weeklong fighting in and around Tetovo, Macedonia's second largest city. The firing lasted all afternoon and hit houses on the wooded hills and at least one village beyond. The barrage was the first part of an offensive planned to drive out the rebels, an official said at the scene. The offensive has strained the multi-ethnic coalition government to a crisis point. Arben Xhaferi, leader of the largest Albanian party, was close to pulling out of the government, which Macedonian Slavs dominate. Mr. Xhaferi said his party would withdraw if civilians were wounded in the fighting or if the government adopted ''the Yugoslav way of war,'' with intensive use of artillery against civilian targets. He said that he opposed the offensive and that his party had not been included in the decision to launch it. He criticized the planned use of force as disproportionate. ''Until now, we are excluded from the decision-making process and we do not agree with only using weapons,'' he said. ''There is a lot of fighting in the villages, and lot of houses are burning now.'' Mr. Xhaferi, who has Parkinson's disease, showed signs of exhaustion at a news conference, as deafening explosions of tank fire drowned out his words. He criticized the Albanian rebels and said he absolutely did not support their use of force. He welcomed an agreement signed today among all Albanian parties that rejected violence, called for the rebels to lay down their weapons and appealed to the population to choose peace. A democratic peaceful Macedonia is crucial to the region, and war would affect the entire Balkans, he said. But he seemed most frustrated with his Slav partners in the government who were sidelining him. ''We must sit at the table and talk,'' he said. ''If the situation degenerates, we will have no other option but to withdraw from the government.'' If Mr. Xhaferi withdraws his group, the lone Albanian party in the government, ''the whole house will burn,'' a senior Albanian politician said. Mr. Xhaferi did not say what it would take to make him withdraw, but the planned offensive could prove decisive. ''We are going to hold on until civilians start getting hurt,'' Mr. Xhaferi said. ''I am waiting for a reaction from the international community. It's my last hope.'' Tanks fired from barracks in the city this afternoon, shaking buildings and rattling windows. The shells hit houses on the hillside west of the town, and reporters in Selce, where the rebels have headquarters, said dozens of shells had landed in that village, which has many civilians. The extent of casualties was not clear. Telephone and electricity lines to the mountain villages have been cut for days. Sniper fire also rang out here in late afternoon, and the police at an intersection opened fire in return, shooting over passing cars. A Macedonian television crew came under fire. The town fell quiet only when the curfew took effect at 7 p.m. Thousands of people have fled their houses since the fighting erupted around Tetovo a week ago. People rushed to buy foreign currency in the capital, and BBC television showed crowds of people lining up for passports in the capital. More than 3,000 ethnic Albanians have left Macedonia for Albania and Serbia, and more than 7,000 ethnic Albanians and Slavs have been displaced in Macedonia, relief organizations said. Many families interviewed said they had sent their children and young men abroad to stay with relatives. The rebels made a plea in a communiqu√© from their headquarters that they not be regarded as terrorists or adventurers. They said they had taken up arms only after years of frustration and discrimination. Peace did not depend on them, the statement said, but on the government and the people. International support remains firmly behind the government. The security chief of the European Union, Javier Solana, visited the capital, Skopje, today to back the government. Mr. Solana advised his hosts not to start talks with the guerrillas. He warned the rebels that they would achieve nothing by force. ''Nothing, and I mean nothing, will be obtained by violent means,'' he said at a news conference. ''It is a mistake to negotiate with terrorists in this particular case, and we do not recommend it.''"
"I read in a magazine that postal carriers are more healthy than people from other professions because they walk outside so much. That's true, but the job takes its toll. One day, when a teenager opened the door for a package, his dog jumped me and bit me in the thigh. The wound wasn't all that bad, and I just kept delivering the mail. Another time, I fell down a flight of slippery wet stairs and landed on my back, still holding the mail in my right hand. It didn't seem like anything serious, and so I got up and continued my rounds. But as I walked along, I felt a pain in my arm. I thought it was broken, so after I finished, I went to see a doctor. He said my arm was bruised but otherwise O.K. However, he said, I had broken my coccyx. He started chuckling. He said, ''Now you can go back and tell the management that you busted your butt for the post office.'' I never dreamed I'd become a letter carrier. I went to Baruch College for two years but moved to Michigan. Then I went to work for Kidder Peabody, the Wall Street firm, as a vault manager, but eight years later, in 1987, I was ready for a change. So I applied at the Postal Service and passed the test for carriers with flying colors. The fun part starts when I leave the office to deliver mail. I love to interact with the customers. Being on the same route for the last 10 years has given me a chance to develop many friendships and made my job easier, too. When I have a delivery for someone and they aren't home, I can usually leave it with a neighbor. One woman, who used to live on my route, became a close friend. When she moved upstate, we exchanged Christmas cards. Many elderly people stay home all day, and sometimes I am the only person they can talk to. One of the most exciting things about my job is that it lets me see children grow up. One boy had a lot of problems at home and sometimes he would walk along with me and talk about them. Recently, he became a firefighter. When I see him, I always laugh and tell him he's better off than me now. By having contact with so many people, I learned a great deal about their customs and culture. Once, I had a package for a Jewish woman. I noticed a mezuza affixed to the side of her door. Although I am not Jewish, a friend had told me about this sign. When she opened the door, I rubbed it according to the custom and entered her house. She got a kick out of that. I have to be very cautious when I leave my cart on the sidewalk. A few weeks ago, I let it out of my sight for a minute to deliver mail in a building, and when I got back, I noticed that a certified letter was missing. I was shocked and started to run around the building. I found the letter ripped open on the ground. There was nothing left inside. All I could do was report the theft. MY JOB Written with Marcin Skomial."
"As tensions roiled this divided city today and two bombing attacks struck Jerusalem, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon faced increasing pressure from his right-wing constituency to deliver on his campaign promise to enhance Israel's security. After the shooting death of an Israeli baby in Hebron on Monday, Jewish settlers began grumbling that Mr. Sharon was not demonstrating any greater resolve than his predecessor, Ehud Barak, to retaliate against Palestinian attacks. They charged that Mr. Sharon was proving too sensitive to diplomatic concerns, like how an Israeli military reprisal would affect the Arab summit meeting in Jordan. After the bombings today, which wounded about 35 people, pressure to respond forcefully mounted within Mr. Sharon's own Likud Party. Limor Livnat, the education minister, urged what he called a significant military response, suggesting that the army's targets should include Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. And Ehud Olmert, the Jerusalem mayor, who otherwise cautioned against expecting too much too quickly from Mr. Sharon, said: ''We can't succumb to fear and weakness because that's what the other side wants. The only consideration should be security. Diplomatic considerations should be secondary.'' [Early Wednesday morning, another bomb exploded near Kfar Saba in central Israel, and preliminary reports by rescue workers indicated that at least three persons were killed and three seriously injured.] Diplomatic analysts believe that Mr. Sharon does not want to take decisive action before the summit meeting concludes on Wednesday and before a large demonstration by Israeli Arabs planned for Friday. His response, if any, could prove to be the first test of how Mr. Sharon negotiates between his old instincts as a warrior and his new ones as a leader who strives to be pragmatic. In a statement issued by his office tonight, Mr. Sharon said: ''The Palestinian Authority and other terrorist bodies have exploited the restraint which the government has shown at the beginning of its term. Despite the fact that Israel has eased restrictions on the residents of the territories in recent days, these bodies have stepped up terrorism and violence by murdering, and striking at, innocent civilians.'' Palestinian officials, bracing for a fierce Israeli retaliation after the summit meeting ends, said that Israel itself brought on the shooting and bombing attacks. With tight restrictions on Palestinian movement, the continuing Israeli occupation of parts of the West Bank and Gaza is an increasing provocation pushing Palestinians to violent resistance, they said. Speaking on the Voice of Palestine, Ahmed Abdul Rahman, secretary of the Palestinian cabinet, said the presence of the small settler population in the overwhelmingly Palestinian city of Hebron was illegitimate. He expressed regret for ''the killing of any human being,'' but said that ''the ultimate crime is Israel's.'' After a thwarted bombing in Petah Tikva on Monday night, today's first bomb hit a shopping street in the Talpiot neighborhood of Jerusalem just before the shops were to open. The normally bustling area was still revving up for the day, and only seven Israelis were wounded, all lightly, by the powerful explosion. Windows of cars and shops were shattered. And the mangled remains of the stolen car that had carried the bomb littered the street. Shlomo Ohayon, a shift supervisor for a security company, said he was nearby when the car was detonated. ''It threw me backward, and I saw fire and billows of smoke,'' he said. ''People were shouting and running, there were people in shock. One woman was shaking, we hugged her and gave her some water to calm her down.'' In the afternoon, the second attack occurred in French Hill, a Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem. Miki Levy, the Jerusalem police chief, said that a suicide bomber wearing an explosive belt had blown himself up while standing beside a bus headed for the settlement of Pisgat Zeev. Several dozen people were wounded, one critically. For over an hour afterward, the bomber's body lay on a busy road between Jerusalem and Ramallah, covered by a yellow blanket. Onlookers gathered, several chanting anti-Arab slogans. Islamic Jihad's military wing claimed responsibility for both bombing attacks in Jerusalem. By dusk, the streets of West Jerusalem were unusually still for a balmy evening as Israelis holed up inside their homes. A waiter stood outside a typically busy restaurant, his arms crossed. ''It's not a time for focaccia,'' he said. Today in Hebron, the settlers were demanding stridently that Mr. Sharon order the Israeli Army to retake the Palestinian hilltop neighborhoods that were transferred to Palestinian rule in 1997. Some 500 settlers, ringed by Israeli troops, live in fortified enclaves in the mostly Palestinian city of Hebron. They are among the most ideologically hard-core settlers in the West Bank, and their relations with the Palestinian majority have been extremely tense for years. Shalhevet Pass, a 10-month-old girl, was killed by a bullet to the head while in her stroller at the entrance to a Jewish enclave on Monday. The enclave playground was swarming with children because new sand had just been delivered to the sandbox. Her father, Yitzhak Pass, was shot in the leg, and that is what her mother saw first. She leaned down to swoop up the baby and run for cover, only to discover that the girl was bleeding profusely, neighbors said. Correction: March 29, 2001, Thursday Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict referred incorrectly to the Israeli education minister, who called for a significant military response to attacks. The minister, Limor Livnat, is a woman. Correction: April 9, 2001, Monday An article on March 28 about pressure on Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to retaliate against Palestinians for attacks on Israelis referred imprecisely to Pisgat Zeev, a Jewish neighborhood built in 1984, which was the destination of a bus attacked by a Palestinian suicide bomber. While the Palestinians consider it a settlement, the Israelis say it is part of municipal Jerusalem."
"The next time you feel like complaining about the neighbors, consider what George Di Bouno has to put up with. His closest neighbor is a huge pile of salt. It moved in next door about 20 years ago. In winter, front-loaders growl around the yard in front of the salt pile 24 hours a day. Whenever they back up, they emit a sleep-bedeviling series of beeps. Not long after the pile of salt moved in, a hulking concrete salt hopper took up residence just beyond Mr. Di Bouno's backyard. Trucks from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey rumble beneath it to grab a giant-sized serving of salt before heading off to de-ice the George Washington Bridge. The Jersey-side tower of that bridge looms outside Mr. Di Bouno's kitchen window. At night, through the slats of his Venetian blinds, it looks like a prehistoric arthropod with a skeleton of steel. Mr. Di Bouno, 60, says he has always loved the look of the bridge, which opened a decade before he was born. But the traffic it now attracts (108 million vehicles last year) has all but obliterated his neighborhood. The wood-frame houses that once lined his street were razed to make way for a bridge-side Marriott hotel that was never built. In every direction, spreading out from the vacant lot where the hotel was to have been, there are tollbooths, offramps, parking lots, queues of idling traffic and, of course, the salt pile. The neighborhood resounds to the incessant yowl of cars and trucks crossing the bridge. Mr. Di Bouno's tidy three-story brick house looks desperately lonely. ''My friends say I am the only person they know who stayed put while the entire neighborhood moved away,'' he said the other night, while sitting in his dining room drinking coffee. He doesn't notice the beeping from the salt pile next door, he said. For the past 38 years, Mr. Di Bouno has commuted from this house to his job as an art teacher at a middle school in River Vale in northern Bergen County. The house is where his grandparents lived after immigrating from Italy. It's where his parents lived throughout their marriage, and where his father died. Mr. Di Bouno lives alone of the top two floors, renting out the ground floor. Excepting four years in the 1950's at Montclair State College, it's the only place that Mr. Di Bouno has ever lived. Next year, though, his house will cease to exist. He got a letter in December from his neighbor, the Port Authority. The letter said that to accommodate traffic on the Palisades Interstate Parkway, which now connects only to the upper level of the nearby bridge, the authority has to build another ramp. That ramp, the letter said, has to be built on the land beneath Mr. Di Bouno's house. In January, he was invited to bridge headquarters in Fort Lee to watch a video. The computer-generated presentation showed the new ramp curving up from the parkway -- on a collision course with his house. The video then showed his house disappearing as the new ramp swept triumphantly to the lower level of the bridge. ''I can't quite remember, as I think back on that video, if my house vaporizes, fades away or explodes,'' Mr. Di Bouno said. ''As I sat there watching, I was wondering if the Port Authority thought this video would make me feel good.'' The Port Authority has promised to pay fair market value for the house and to compensate him for the cost of moving. The authority would not say how much it might pay for the house, which Mr. Di Bouno said was worth at least $200,000. ''We feel bad about this,'' said Gerard Del Tufo, physical plant manager at the bridge, who explained that in the video the house was ''morphed'' out of existence. ''We are trying to do what is right for the public good. Our intention is not to hurt this person.'' Mr. Di Bouno said he understood that and did not hold a grudge against the authority. He expects to be treated fairly. Still, he dreads the move. ''I am not delusional,'' he said. ''I know that the neighborhood is derelict. But you know how you can see anything two ways?'' There is a fig tree in his backyard that has been in his memory as long as he has had one. It produces figs every year. When he is tending the tree, Mr. Di Bouno said, the salt pile, the traffic noise and the rest of the dismal present are easy to ignore. The Port Authority, which plans to have the new ramp finished by 2004, says he will probably have one more growing season before it demolishes his house and paves over the roots of the fig tree."
"The death toll in four coordinated explosions that shook a central Chinese city early Friday rose to 108, while the investigation into the blasts has apparently focused on a resident of one of the destroyed buildings who is already wanted for murder. State television reported that 38 people were also injured in the explosions, which leveled one five-story residential building and damaged three others in Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei Province, about 160 miles south of Beijing. Meanwhile, local newspapers carried a rare front-page wanted notice for Jin Ruchao, 40, who is suspected in a March 9 killing of a woman in southwestern China and other ''current'' and ''extremely serious crimes.'' The notice did not mention Friday's blasts but it offered a $6,000 reward, a huge amount of money in the region's depressed economy and something that's almost unheard of in China. The notice said Mr. Jin was a resident of the building where the biggest blast occurred, a residential block for workers at the city's No. 3 Cotton Mill. That building was flattened by the first of Friday's explosions at about 4 a.m. and most of the deaths and injuries occurred there. Little other information was given about Mr. Jin, who was described in the wanted notice as deaf and whose accompanying picture showed a thin, angular-faced man with a receding hairline and sideburns. A woman answering the telephone at the main office of the city's No. 3 Cotton Mill said she did not know if Mr. Jin had been an employee at the company, which has about 10,000 workers. Rumors in the city initially suggested that angry laid-off factory workers might be responsible for the bombings. Shijiazhuang, in the heart of China's cotton belt, is a hub of the country's financially troubled textile industry, which has laid off about 1.4 million cotton mill workers since 1998. Friday's explosions occurred within one hour and several miles of each other, damaging residential buildings for workers at two cotton mills, a railroad agency and a construction company. Wang Zhongyu, secretary general of China's cabinet, toured the four blast sites and visited hospitals on Friday, the official New China News Agency said."
"Maurizio Pollini has been particularly inventive in the programming for his Perspectives series, presented by Carnegie Hall but residing two weeks recently at the 92nd Street Y. In the first two of his three concerts at the Y, he presented chamber music, some requiring his services as a pianist, some played by members of two guest ensembles, the Accardo Quartet and the Ensemble Wien-Berlin. Those programs brought together old and new, but for sheer historical sweep neither touched the closing program, offered on Wednesday night. Included was music as early as Greek chant that may have been composed around 400 B.C. and as recent as Luciano Berio's ''Altra Voce,'' composed in 1999. Mr. Pollini's participation was unusual as well. In the first half of the program, he was merely the curator and did not play. After the intermission he appeared in a role that is unusual for him: he played the harpsichord continuo in a selection of Monteverdi madrigals. One thing Mr. Pollini may have wanted to show in this peculiar but satisfying program was the balance, or perhaps the tension, between melody and harmony. Most of the music on the first half of the program was composed as a single melodic line. In the case of the Greek chants, as revived through scholarly guesswork, that line has rhythmic qualities in common with plainchant. But its melodies are unshackled, and some of them soar and twist in ways that plainchant melodies never do. George Steel led sopranos and altos from his Vox Vocal Ensemble in five varied examples. In the last of the chants, a fragment from ''Orestes,'' Michele Marasco provided subtle punctuation on the flute and then gave a smoothly flowing account of Debussy's gracefully winding solo flute work, ''Syrinx.'' One could follow Mr. Pollini's associations here: surviving fragments of Greek antiquity, cloaked in modern scholarly assumptions, gave way to an early-20th-century modernist's Romantic vision of ancient Greek music. From there the subject shifts to solo virtuosity. ''Syrinx'' was the center of gravity in the unaccompanied flute repertory from 1913 until 1958, when Mr. Berio's ''Sequenza'' for flute encouraged players to push the instrument's limits. That work was not included here, but the ''Sequenza VII'' for oboe (1969) and the ''Sequenza III'' for voice (1966) were. They are very different works, but they have in common a sense that drama and a kind of intuitive meaning can be deduced from gesture, even in the absence of a text. Jacqueline Leclair, an oboist, and Luisa Castellani, a mezzo-soprano, met the works' challenges with an electrifying agility. ''Altra Voce,'' the newer Berio work, expanded on the single-line texture. Scored for flute, voice and live electronics (Mr. Marasco was joined by Monica Bacelli, mezzo-soprano, and the sound manipulators of Centro Tempo Reale), the piece begins with the flute and voice repeating a single pitch and then moves gradually afield. In the end the interplay of the flute, voice and electronic sounds creates an appealingly tactile web of sound. The move from single lines to two (plus electronics) at the end of the program's first half gave way to an explosion of polyphony after the intermission. Mr. Pollini proved an able continuo player, working only with a cellist in several selections from the Seventh Book of Madrigals (1619), and conducting a string ensemble in selections from the Eighth Book of Madrigals (1638). Ms. Bacelli was the vocal soloist in several of these, including ''Lamento della Ninfa,'' to which she brought an interestingly rough-hewn charm. The other singers, who gave superb, communicative performances of ensemble works, were Sara Mingardo and Bernadette Manca di Nissa, contraltos; Mario Cecchetti and Furio Zanasi, tenors; and Antonio Abete, bass. MUSIC REVIEW"
"To the Editor: Re ''China Sends Its Army Money, and Taiwan a Signal'' (Week in Review, March 11): Beijing's increase in defense spending will allow its army to subsist comfortably without engaging in commercial enterprises on the side. But soldiers weren't the only ones moonlighting: so were the elementary-school children in Wanzai County who built fireworks during lunch to supplement inadequate school financing. This enterprise may have led to the deaths of at least 42 people, mostly children, in an explosion at the school last week. This is a sobering illustration of where Beijing's priorities lie. The fear that Taiwan will declare independence validates spending $17.2 billion on defense while the education system remains in squalor. If there isn't enough money to go around, President Jiang Zemin should let the soldiers build the fireworks, not the children.

"The Federal Aviation Administration told airlines today to stop using a fuel pump on the Boeing 737 under certain circumstances after investigators found that the pump might have contributed to the explosion of a plane at a gate in Bangkok last month. The agency told the airlines not to run the pump in the center fuel tank when the tank was empty or nearly so. Investigators believe that was the situation in Bangkok. The Thai explosion occurred shortly before boarding was to begin; a flight attendant was killed. Thai authorities said they suspected sabotage, but no trace of explosives was found. Another 737 exploded on a runway in Manila in May 1990. American investigators have compared the Thai explosion with the explosion in flight of T.W.A. 800, a Boeing 747, a few minutes after it left Kennedy Airport on July 17, 1996. In both cases, the airplane sat on the ground on a warm day with the air-conditioners running. In the Boeing design, the heat from air-conditioning is dissipated by devices under the center fuel tank, and warms the tank. Heating the tank turns the fuel to vapor, which can explode if a spark is present. The phenomenon was not well understood before the T.W.A. 800 crash, which killed all 230 people aboard when the center tank exploded. Investigators do not believe that pumps were running on that airplane, although the tank was nearly empty, which could allow an explosive vapor to develop. Fuel pumps are designed to be submerged in fuel, which lubricates and cools them. In the 737, the pump delivers fuel to a piping system that feeds the engines on the wings, but if it pumps the tank dry or nearly so, it can overheat and provide a spark, experts say. Some people involved in the investigation in Thailand say the pump was running and the tank was empty, but a report has not yet been issued. ''When you run them when they're dry, bearings wear out, you get metal rubbing on metal, and you get heat,'' an F.A.A. official said. Boeing, which has long recommended not running the pump if the tank is dry, sent out a reminder to 737 operators worldwide on April 11 in response to the Thai explosion."
"The National Transportation Safety Board today described the explosion of a Boeing 737 in Thailand last month in terms similar to those used to describe T.W.A. Flight 800, a Boeing 747 that exploded in 1996 off Long Island. The Thai Airways International plane exploded at an airport in Bangkok, in what was initially believed to be sabotage. Thai authorities said they had found traces of explosives. But the safety board said today that the F.B.I. had found no traces of explosives. The blast was in the center-wing fuel tank, in the fuselage. On both models, the tank is above heat exchangers that the air-conditioning system uses to take heat out of the cabin. The air-conditioners had been running for about 40 minutes, the board said. Heating the tank allows fuel to turn to vapor, and it can explode if a spark is present. Investigators say they believe that is what happened to T.W.A. 800, shortly after takeoff on July 17, 1996."
"The most violent explosions in the universe appear to originate in dust-shrouded regions inside galaxies where stars form at a prodigious rate, according to observations by a network of satellites and telescopes that scientists described today at a conference here. Scientists do not know exactly what sets off the explosions, called gamma ray bursts for the high-energy radiation they emit. But an extremely bright burst that began on Feb. 22 is providing fresh clues. The burst was observed by dozens of instruments. If the scientists have interpreted those observations correctly, bursts may become beacons that allow astronomers to trace the history of star formation in the early cosmos. Though the formation regions are often extremely distant and obscured by dust and gas, the colossal outpourings of energy in gamma ray bursts easily punch through the haze. ''This may be a very important cosmic probe of where stars are forming in the universe,'' said Dr. Fiona Harrison, an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology. If gamma ray bursts are determined to arise in stellar nurseries, the finding would be in line with theories suggesting that some of the most massive stars born there, those perhaps 50 times as massive as the sun, occasionally collapse and explode, producing a gamma ray burst. Scientists who spoke at the conference, of which the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center was host, said they could not entirely rule out a competing theory that bursts occur when two superdense objects called neutron stars fall together and merge catastrophically. But the new clues support what were once speculations that the bursts represent the violent death throes of very large stars. ''While it isn't settled, all of the evidence is pointing toward the rapid death of massive stars,'' said Dr. Andrew Fruchter, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute here. The universe as seen with instruments that can detect high-energy radiation like gamma rays is far more capricious and changeable than the placid starscape visible to the eye, said Dr. Luigi Piro, an astronomer at the National Research Council in Italy and the mission scientist for the Italian-Dutch satellite BeppoSAX, which first observed the Feb. 22 burst. As seen in gamma rays and their less energetic cousins, X-rays, Dr. Piro said, ''the universe is very violent.'' He added, ''Gamma ray bursts are the most extreme example of this violent universe.'' The Feb. 22 burst emitted powerful gamma rays for perhaps two minutes, Dr. Piro said. Like a fading ember, the explosion then began producing much longer-lasting emissions of X-rays, radio waves and visible light. The burst's extraordinary brightness set off observations by satellites like the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory, as well as many ground instruments, including the Keck Telescope and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, both on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Scientists determined that the event originated about 10 billion light years away and that it was among the most powerful gamma ray bursts on record. Dr. Piro said the X-ray observations also showed that the explosion probably occurred in a dense, gaseous environment -- characteristics of star-forming regions. He said some of that evidence emerged from measurements of radiation characteristic of iron atoms, an element that is produced in substantial amounts only in tremendous explosions involving a large quantity of material. Dr. Piro estimated that in iron atoms alone, the source of the explosion, whatever it was, had heaved the equivalent of 1 percent to 10 percent the mass of the entire Sun into space. Dr. Fruchter said other lines of evidence suggested that galaxies in which the bursts occur are producing stars, on average, at greater rates than other galaxies in the early universe, which overall represents a kind of baby boom of star formation."
"Two detectors in Antarctica have discovered minute patterns in a glow from primordial gases, possible traces of the cosmic match that ignited the Big Bang and led to the creation of the universe 14 billion years ago, astronomers announced here today. The patterns, astronomers said, were probably created by microscopic processes -- energy fluctuations at the quantum scale -- that were at work when the universe was a tiny fraction of a second old and smaller than a human fist. The new observations do not see the quantum fluctuations directly, but instead have found traces of colossal waves, much like sound waves, that the fluctuations probably set in motion, roiling the young universe. The results rest on the most detailed observations ever made of a glow from the hot gases of the early universe. That glow, called cosmic microwave background radiation, carried an imprint of those waves to the detectors on Earth. The news comes as a relief for astronomers, some of whom started to worry last year that their basic picture of the origins of the universe might be flawed, after detailed observations failed to find the wave patterns. ''We see the structure of the universe in its infancy,'' said Dr. John Carlstrom, a University of Chicago astrophysicist who leads the team operating the Degree Angular Scale Interferometer, or DASI (pronounced daisy), a microwave detector at a South Pole research station operated by the National Science Foundation. Dr. Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago who was not involved in the measurements, said that the precise time the fluctuations took place remained to be determined by future measurements, but that the process was likely to have taken place in a fraction of a second comparable to a decimal point followed by 32 zeros and a 1. ''We are living in the most exciting time ever in cosmology,'' he added. Besides DASI, which also involved astronomers at the California Institute of Technology, the announcement today included the so-called Boomerang team. This group flew a balloon-borne detector around Antarctica, and includes astronomers from the United States, Italy, Canada and Britain. Antarctica is excellent for such observations because the air is thin and dry and does not strongly absorb microwave radiation. Dr. John Ruhl of the University of California at Santa Barbara presented results today for the Boomerang team. The announcements took place at a meeting of the American Physical Society. The Antarctica studies were buttressed today when another group of researchers reported that they had made less distinct observations of the wave patterns from the United States. That team, called Maxima, includes astronomers at the University of Minnesota and the University of California at Berkeley. The leading theory of how the universe could have exploded out of the primordial nothingness, known as the theory of inflation, predicts that the quantum fluctuations should have rattled the universe in such a way that it resonated like a vast organ pipe, with one main tone, or wavelength, and a series of overtones or harmonics. Last year, the Boomerang team detected the main tone but found no clear evidence for the overtones, raising the possibility that the inflation theory could be wrong. Since much of the information about the fluctuations, like their relative intensity and spectrum, would reside in the characteristics of the overtones, those results raised the prospect that few remnants of the initial spark might be found. Today, the three teams announced that they had seen two of the overtones for the first time. In musical terms, the observations saw the first two harmonics above the main tone. ''We do see two more bumps and wiggles out there,'' Dr. Ruhl said. ''We can move to the question of, 'What do these bumps and wiggles tell us?' '' Dr. Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at the University of Pennsylvania, said that while the new results were still far from absolute proof of the inflation theory, their agreement with the theory was uncanny and would cast doubt on alternative models. ''It's even scary that things agree this well,'' he said. ''This is a very bad day for the competition.'' Some other scientists, including Dr. Andrew Lange of Caltech, a leader of the Boomerang group, said the results strikingly showed that cosmologists understood the composition and behavior of the universe in the first few hundred thousand years of its life. It was then that the sound waves were humming through the young cosmos; astronomers believe the microwave background radiation was emitted as the universe cooled below a critical temperature when it was about 400,000 years old. ''We've really been waiting for the other shoe to drop,'' Dr. Lange said in reference to the lengthy search for the overtones. ''What we're confirming for the first time is a very generic prediction of modern cosmology.'' Although astronomers said much more detailed observations, including the discovery of further overtones, would be required to define the quantum fluctuations and to verify inflation, the results are likely to be seen as major victories for two scientists in particular. The first, Dr. Alan Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, developed the germ of the inflation model in 1980, a theory he has called ''the ultimate free lunch'' because it shows how the entire universe could have exploded out of nothing and impressed the quantum fluctuations on the cosmos. The results also provide major support for ideas closely associated with Dr. David Schramm, a Chicago cosmologist who died in a plane crash late in 1997. Dr. Schramm and his colleagues worked out a theory, unrelated to inflation, using trace elements created in the Big Bang explosion to gauge the amount of ordinary matter in the universe. Those values agree closely with the amounts deduced from the intensity of the sound wave overtones; that intensity is affected by the sloshing of matter in the sound waves' peaks and troughs. On the other hand, the results also leave cosmologists with some deep and perhaps troubling questions. For example, the new observations confirm that most of the cosmos seems to be made of so-called dark matter and dark energy, possibly particles or energy lurking somewhere in space but still never detected directly. Dr. Turner, of Chicago, said skeptics might well term that picture ''the absurd universe, or the preposterous universe.'' Sir Martin Rees, an astrophysicist at Cambridge University, said scientists were left with the question of whether fundamental physical laws would someday explain that strange mixture of ingredients, or whether the precise amounts were a sort of accident of how the universe came into being -- something like snowflakes, each of which has a hexagonal symmetry but carries a pattern that is otherwise unique. ''It may well turn out that the underlying laws do not give us these numbers, any more than they give the detailed pattern of a snowflake,'' Sir Martin said."
"Iraq tested a bomb in 1987 that cast a radioactive cloud in the open air and was designed to cause vomiting, cancer, birth defects and slow death, according to a secret Iraqi report on the weapon's construction and testing. Radiation sickness from the bomb, the document said, would ''weaken enemy units from the standpoint of health and inflict losses that would be difficult to explain, possibly producing a psychological effect.'' Death, it added, might occur ''within two to six weeks.'' The bomb, 12 feet long and weighing more than a ton, according to the document, could be dropped on troop areas, industrial centers, airports, railroad stations, bridges and ''any other areas the command decrees.'' While the existence of Iraq's effort to build a radiological weapon has been known for several years, the 1987 report sheds light on the secret effort. The New York Times obtained the document from the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, a private group in Washington that said it acquired it from a United Nations official. Radiation or radiological weapons, sometimes known as ''dirty nukes,'' are the poor cousins of nuclear arms. Their conventional high explosives scatter highly radioactive materials to poison targets rather than destroying them with blast and heat. Their effects on people can range from radiation sickness to agonizingly slow death, which is why military experts often see them as ethically bankrupt. ''It shows what kind of guy we're dealing with,'' said Gary Milhollin, the group's director, of the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein. The bomb, he added, was ''nasty stuff meant to kill people over a long period of time'' and thus, he said, ''crossed the line into moral barbarism.'' It was basically a dud, however, Mr. Milhollin said, and that caused the Iraqis to scrap the project. The radiation levels were considered too low to achieve the grisly objectives. The episode nonetheless ''shows Iraq's intention'' to develop weapons of mass destruction, he added. The official who disclosed the document, Mr. Milhollin said, is ''concerned that Saddam is going to get the bomb.'' The United Nations rarely discloses documents gathered in Iraq, but David Albright, formerly a nuclear inspector in Iraq, said he had seen the document and that it he did not doubt it was authentic. He and other experts agreed that the document, which is to be posted on a Web site Monday, gives away no secrets that could aid weapons development and no indication that the project was a resounding failure. Nuclear experts say Iraq today has neither programs to develop radiological weapons nor the reactors needed to make radioactive materials for them, and no fuel for nuclear arms. The reactor used in making the prototype radiological weapon was itself bombed during the gulf war in 1991, and inspectors tried to keep Iraq from resuming its nuclear efforts for years afterward. But today the inspectors are largely gone and American experts worry that Iraq may be quietly shopping for bomb fuel and parts on the international black market. ''There's growing concern that Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program and will make steady progress because it knows so much already,'' said Mr. Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, an arms control group in Washington. Iraq's testing of its radiological weapon was done in 1987 as it waged a war of attrition against Iran and considered the radiation bomb as a way to cripple enemy forces. The document said the work was undertaken by Atomic Energy Agency and the Al Qa-Qa and Al Muthanna centers of the Iraqi Military Industrial Commission. To make the radioactive materials, Iraqi engineers prepared special metals to irradiate in a reactor at Tuwaitha, Iraq's primary nuclear site. The document said the metal was mostly zirconium, which is often used in atomic reactors because it resists corrosion. The zirconium mixture also included hafnium, uranium and iron. Zirconium was chosen, the document said, because a production process for it already existed since the metal was used for incendiary bombs. When finely powdered, the metal ignites spontaneously in air. The half-life of zirconium 95, the document said, was 75.5 days. This relatively short period of radioactive decay, it said, ''helps to dissipate the effect of the bomb after several weeks so that it is difficult to track, analyze, or recognize.'' The brevity, it added, gives ''the desired biological effects'' while making it ''possible for our units to go to the bombed area without great danger after this period has expired.'' The document has many diagrams. They show at the bomb's core a thick three-foot lead case, shielding workers from its radioactive rays, that held the zirconium. This leaden case fit inside an eight-foot casing that held fuses and explosive charges and was capped by tail fins four feet long. The weapon and its parts were tested three times in 1987, the document said. The first sought to see if the thick lead case holding an irradiated charge could be blown apart, in order to discharge. It could. The second test was of a bomb sitting on the ground. ''The explosion was awesome,'' said the report. ''We saw the blast wave moving out of the center of the explosion in the form of a circle moving at great speed.'' The radioactive cloud rose more than 600 feet. In the third test, the Iraqi Air Force dropped two bombs, which again produced huge clouds. ''We must point out,'' the report said, ''that a significant part of the fallout went with the cloud into the air and it was not possible to follow this small amount of radioactive matter by means of the portable equipment.'' Radiation readings on the ground were rather low, in one case ''290 times above the highest level allowed nationally for foodstuffs.'' The document reported no readings taken in the air -- a critical oversight for a weapon meant to hurt and kill people largely through the inhalation of radioactive particles. The main flaws of the weapon, the report said, were that its radioactive charges lost strength quickly. The irradiatiated charge had to be used within a week. Calm weather was also essential. Another drawback, it said, was that the work had to be done in strict secrecy, ''even with regard to those doing the work, so as not to give rise to psychological feelings leading to hesitation because of a fear of radiation.'' A final problem, it said, was that an alert enemy might come to realize that the exploding bombs packed a lingering punch, allowing the future development of defensive precautions. It even suggested that satellites might be able to spot radiation from ''a concentrated strike,'' a feat that seems unlikely. Iraq gave the document to the inspectors and the United Nations apparently referred to it in a April 1996 report of the United Nations special commission set up to monitor Iraq's disarmament. ''Iraq declared,'' it said, ''that no order to produce radiological weapons was given and the project was abandoned.'' The document is to be posted Monday at www.iraqwatch.org, a new initiative of the Wisconsin Project. The main supporter of the Web site is the Smith-Richardson Foundation, a private group in Westport, Conn., that specializes in issues of national security. Mr. Milhollin of the Wisconsin Project said that the radiation effort was clearly a flop, despite the report's upbeat language. ''When you read this, you get the impression that the guys in Iraq were trying to put best face on the results, to exaggerate them,'' he said. ''But if you look at the figures, it's obvious it didn't work.''"
"Russian investigators released dramatic pictures of the drydocked wreck of the nuclear submarine Kursk today which appear to show that explosions that sank the boat 14 months ago also spread a ferocious fire and destruction through much of its interior. Vladimir Ustinov, Russia's prosecutor general and the head of a criminal inquiry into the disaster, said the ruin of twisted metal and scorched equipment extended well into the 490-foot-long submarine. It was apparent, he said, that none of the 116 crew members and two civilians aboard lived for more than eight hours after the boat fell to the floor of the Barents Sea, 356 feet below the surface. ''What happened here was hell, the worst kind of hell,'' Mr. Ustinov said in a seven-minute videotape of the wreckage released to Russian television networks today. Since a Dutch salvage firm towed the Kursk into drydock late last week, minus 65 feet of its bow left behind on the sea floor, officials had limited pictures of the submarine to views of its intact hull and conning tower, emblazoned with a huge double-headed Russian eagle. They offered no explanation for their change of heart. But at a news conference today, Mr. Ustinov and other officials used the release of the video to defend once more the government's initial response to the accident, which was savaged at the time as bumbling and xenophobic. The navy waited much of a day before announcing that the submarine was missing, then waited days more before summoning help from British and Norwegian rescue experts. Some of those experts later complained that the military's obsession with red tape and secrecy hamstrung them further. Mr. Ustinov said today that in the end, no rescue was possible. ''I want to tell those who say there was a chance to save them: there wasn't,'' he said. ''There was such an explosion here that nothing could survive.'' Officials said they had so far found 19 bodies in the submarine, removed 17 and identified seven. Eleven of the dead were found in the rear of the boat, in compartment nine, where deep-sea divers removed 12 bodies almost exactly one year ago in a risky recovery operation. The remaining eight were found in the sub's third compartment, not far from the bow-area torpedo room where the fatal explosions took place. Mr. Ustinov had predicted earlier that workers would find as few as 40 of the crewmen. Today he pledged that ''there will not be a single unexamined spot where a body or a part of a body might remain.'' But the prospect for locating many more of the dead, he said, were problematic. Two days after they first entered the wreck, clad in gas masks and protective clothing, investigators said today that the Krusk's two nuclear reactors and its 22 supersonic cruise missiles had weathered the devastation and presented no hazard. The missiles could be deactivated and removed starting next week; the dismantling of the reactors removal of their fuel will not begin for weeks. Although they have ordered new tests based on unspecified evidence found in the wreck, the investigators said they were little closer to answering the question of what caused the catastrophe. The Kursk was cruising at periscope depth, its 116 sailors and officers and two civilian weapons experts engaged in a Northern Fleet military exercise, when a first small explosion rippled across its bow on Aug. 12 of last year. Two minutes and 15 seconds later, a blast said by seismologists to carry the power of one to two tons of TNT blew out the bow, and the boat plunged to the bottom of the Barents Sea. The navy's top officials insisted immediately after the accident that the boat almost certainly had hit a World War II-era mine or a foreign ship, most likely a NATO submarine. For months afterward officials pointed to evidence, from grooves purportedly dug into the ship's side to a mysterious sonar image of a second boat supposedly lying near the Kursk, to support the theory that the sailors were innocent victims of a collision. But many experts continue to believe that the disaster occurred after an experimental torpedo employing a powerful new propulsion system triggered an explosion, perhaps as it lodged in a tube during firing. The boat was launching torpedoes as part of a naval exercise when it sank. Today the commander of the Russian navy, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, joined Mr. Ustinov in pledging that the cause of the disaster will be found and made public, even if the military is at fault. ''We have to find the cause and element of it,'' Admiral Kuroyedov said. ''Not to find the reason, and not to do anything about it, would be a crime.'' Investigators said today -- and the video appeared to confirm -- that the explosions caused such havoc that sailors probably had no time even to begin emergency procedures or don rescue suits. Mr. Ustinov claimed that tests had shown that the center of the fire aboard the boat was measured in the thousands of degrees. The commander of the navy's Northern Fleet, Admiral Vyacheslav Popov, said crewmen who survived the blasts were soon drowned or asphyxiated by toxic gases from the subsequent fire. ''There was fire throughout the submarine,'' he said. ''We expect confirmation that the boat was completely flooded within six, seven, eight hours.'' The latest explanation, however, appears at odds with much of what navy officials were saying in the hours and days after the Kursk went down. Initially, there were reports that the navy was in radio contact with the boat. For two days officials said they detected increasingly faint tapping from inside the sub's hull which had been interpreted as a desperate request for fresh air. In contrast to the national outpouring of grief that followed the disaster 14 months ago, Admiral Popov said today, the names of those sailors whose bodies are being removed from the Kursk would not be released until the entire submarine has been examined, all bodies identified and the burials completed. The few who have been identified are already being released to relatives, who have been given the choice of coming to Murmansk to receive their loved ones or having them flown home in military jets for burial. Two jets landed at the Murmansk airport today. Admiral Popov said he wished to avoid the chaos surrounding the Kursk's sinking last year, when the crew roster was posted on the Internet and both relatives and government officials were besieged by television cameras. Today, at least one relative politely differed. ''What is the secret? I am against it being hidden,'' said Vladimir Ruzlyov. ''People should know where and when sailors will be buried. They have known pain, and now there will be even more pain.'' Mr. Ruzlyov's 25-year-old son, Aleksandr, was a boatswain on the Kursk. Mr. Ruzlyov himself has served on nuclear submarines since 1971, and serves today on the submarine Novgorod Velikiy. Almost all relatives of the Kursk victims have left Vidyayevo, a navy town some 50 miles from here, where they lived when their husbands or sons were sailors. Mr. Ruzlyov, a navy man, has stayed. He says he wants to go to the drydock, to look inside the Kursk, to see what happened. And then, if his son is found, he wants to bury him in Ryazan, a city about 150 miles south of Moscow that is Mr. Ruzlyov's hometown. But Aleksandr served in the submarine's second compartment, almost directly above the site of the blasts. Mr. Ruzlyov said he did not believe that the body will be found."
"Now memories orbit around small things. None of the other window washers liked his old green bucket, but Jan Demczur, who worked inside 1 World Trade Center, found its rectangular mouth perfect for dipping and wetting his squeegee in one motion. So on the morning of the 11th, as he waited at the 44th-floor Sky Lobby to connect with elevators for higher floors, bucket and squeegee dangled from the end of his arm. The time was 8:47 a.m. With five other men -- Shivam Iyer, John Paczkowski, George Phoenix, Colin Richardson and another man whose identity could not be learned -- Mr. Demczur (pronounced DEM-sir) boarded Car 69-A, an express elevator that stopped on floors 67 through 74. The car rose, but before it reached its first landing, ''We felt a muted thud,'' Mr. Iyer said. ''The building shook. The elevator swung from side to side, like a pendulum.'' Then it plunged. In the car, someone punched an emergency stop button. At that moment -- 8:48 a.m. -- 1 World Trade Center had entered the final 100 minutes of its existence. No one knew the clock was running, least of all the men trapped inside Car 69-A; they were as cut off 500 feet in the sky as if they had been trapped 500 feet underwater. They did not know their lives would depend on a simple tool. After 10 minutes, a live voice delivered a blunt message over the intercom. There had been an explosion. Then the intercom went silent. Smoke seeped into the elevator cabin. One man cursed skyscrapers. Mr. Phoenix, the tallest, a Port Authority engineer, poked for a ceiling hatch. Others pried apart the car doors, propping them open with the long wooden handle of Mr. Demczur's squeegee. There was no exit. They faced a wall, stenciled with the number ''50.'' That particular elevator bank did not serve the 50th floor, so there was no need for an opening. To escape, they would have to make one themselves. Mr. Demczur felt the wall. Sheetrock. Having worked in construction in his early days as a Polish immigrant, he knew that it could be cut with a sharp knife. No one had a knife. From his bucket, Mr. Demczur drew his squeegee. He slid its metal edge against the wall, back and forth, over and over. He was spelled by the other men. Against the smoke, they breathed through handkerchiefs dampened in a container of milk Mr. Phoenix had just bought. Sheetrock comes in panels about one inch thick, Mr. Demczur recalled. They cut an inch, then two inches. Mr. Demczur's hand ached. As he carved into the third panel, his hand shook, he fumbled the squeegee and it dropped down the shaft. He had one tool left: a short metal squeegee handle. They carried on, with fists, feet and handle, cutting an irregular rectangle about 12 by 18 inches. Finally, they hit a layer of white tiles. A bathroom. They broke the tiles. One by one, the men squirmed through the opening, headfirst, sideways, popping onto the floor near a sink. Mr. Demczur turned back. ''I said, 'Pass my bucket out,' '' he recalled. By then, about 9:30, the 50th floor was already deserted, except for firefighters, astonished to see the six men emerge. ''I think it was Engine Company 5,'' Mr. Iyer said. ''They hustled us to the staircase.'' On the excruciating single-file descent through the smoke, someone teased Mr. Demczur about bringing his bucket. ''The company might not order me another one,'' he replied. At the 15th floor, Mr. Iyer said: ''We heard a thunderous, metallic roar. I thought our lives had surely ended then.'' The south tower was collapsing. It was 9:59. Mr Demczur dropped his bucket. The firefighters shouted to hurry. At 23 minutes past 10, they burst onto the street, ran for phones, sipped oxygen and, five minutes later, fled as the north tower collapsed. Their escape had taken 95 of the 100 minutes. ''It took up to one and a half minutes to clear each floor, longer at the lower levels,'' said Mr. Iyer, an engineer with the Port Authority. ''If the elevator had stopped at the 60th floor, instead of the 50th, we would have been five minutes too late. ''And that man with the squeegee. He was like our guardian angel.'' Since that day, Mr. Demczur has stayed home with his wife and children. He has pieced together the faces of the missing with the men and women he knew in the stations of his old life: the security guard at the Japanese bank on the 93rd floor, who used to let him in at 6:30; the people at Carr Futures on 92; the head of the Port Authority. Their faces keep him awake at night, he says. His hands, the one that held the squeegee and the other that carried the bucket, shake with absence. A NATION CHALLENGED: OBJECTS"
"The apartment fire that killed a 43-year-old mother of two here Sunday morning was intentionally set, but the circumstances of the blaze remained a mystery today, the authorities said. Intense burn patterns in the living room have convinced investigators that the fire was an arson, said Fred L. Schwanwede, first assistant Bergen County prosecutor. But, he said, further tests are needed to determine what type of accelerant was used. In addition, he said, detectives do not know how the fire was started or by whom. An autopsy determined today that the victim, identified as Mi Sun Goh, died of smoke inhalation and burns on all her skin, Mr. Schwanwede said. Firemen found her body near a window in the dining room of her first-floor garden apartment in southern Leonia. Her husband, Jae San Goh, a 43-year-old driver for a limousine company, escaped from the apartment, apparently through a ground-floor window, with his clothing on fire. He apparently helped the couple's children, Kevin, 7, and Sally, 3, to escape through the window, officials said. Residents of the apartment complex put out Mr. Goh's burning clothes with hand-held extinguishers, a neighbor said. Mr. Goh was in critical condition today at the Hackensack University Medical Center in Hackensack, with second-degree burns on 65 percent of his skin, said a hospital spokeswoman, Peggy Schunk. In late afternoon, he was transferred to the burn unit at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. The two children were reported in good condition, with first-degree burns, at the medical center in Hackensack. Mr. Goh's condition prevented detectives from questioning him today, Mr. Schwanwede said. He would not say whether the children provided any information about the start of the fire. A resident of the apartment complex, Mary Connolly, said she was awakened about 10 a.m. Sunday by an explosion. She said she went to her window and saw raging flames coming from the front door and two windows in the Gohs' apartment. ''The blaze was horrendous,'' she said. She said the first explosion was followed by two smaller explosions that sounded like ''cans popping.'' Leonia firefighters managed to extinguish the flames in about 10 minutes and kept them from spreading to the three other apartments in the two-story brick unit where the Gohs lived. Another resident of the complex, John Keese, called Mrs. Goh a ''lovely, lovely person.'' About a year ago, she started a novelty store, Surprise Gift Shop, in Ridgewood, an affluent suburb in western Bergen County, about 15 miles away. The store, which sells stuffed animals, whimsical decals and children's notebooks, among other merchandise, was not open today. ''She was a very sweet, hard-working, friendly woman,'' said Vinnie Barbuto, the manager of a shoe-repair shop across the street from Mrs. Goh's store. He said she often asked his advice on business matters in the weeks after her store opened. ''She was very interested in trying to do better for herself and her family,'' he said."
"Seven Palestinians were killed today in the West Bank and Gaza, some from bombs that may have been intended for Israelis. [An eighth Palestinian was shot and killed overnight by Israeli troops who tried to arrest him near Qalqilya, on the West Bank, The Associated Press reported. [And the Israeli Army said an Israeli motorist was killed in a shooting attack on Tuesday near the Jewish settlement of Ofra in the West Bank, Reuters reported.] Despite the surge in violence, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, speaking from New York, said on Israeli television tonight that Israel and the Palestinians were actively pursuing a cease-fire accord. Shortly after the broadcast, Palestinians unleashed a mortar barrage at a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip. Israeli artillery retaliated fiercely. In Ramallah, an explosion ripped through a house across the street from Yasir Arafat's residence, killing a man and two children inside. Some people at the scene said men in the house had been building a bomb. A local leader of Mr. Arafat's movement, Fatah, blamed Israel for the blast. The Israeli military said it had no knowledge of it. Earlier, in Gaza, a Palestinian worker in a Jewish settlement was killed by a bomb that destroyed the parked car of his Israeli employer. The bomb exploded as the Palestinian was standing nearby. Israeli military spokesmen said later that the man might have been responsible. In a separate incident in Gaza, two activists in the militant Hamas faction were killed by a car bomb that Hamas leaders said was planted by Israeli intelligence agents. Other Palestinians suggested that the bomb could have been a Hamas device that exploded accidentally. In an incident in the West Bank, a Palestinian man was killed today while fleeing from gunmen that residents said were Israeli agents."
"The Federal Aviation Administration plans to issue new rules next week governing the inspection and maintenance of airliner fuel tanks, part of a stream of requirements arising from the explosion of T.W.A. Flight 800 in July 1996. The agency has not said precisely how the rules will be revised, but F.A.A. officials said the changes would cost the industry about $165 million over the next 10 years, or several thousand dollars per aircraft, suggesting that the changes are not extensive. Typically, the costs include the labor required for inspections or maintenance, plus lost revenue when the plane must be in a hangar instead of in the air. The rules will set new requirements for designs of planes not yet in production. The anticipated schedule for release of the rules was first reported today in USA Today. A more expensive option to prevent explosions, requiring airlines to pump inert gas into mostly empty fuel tanks, is still before an F.A.A. advisory committee, which is to report back to the agency in July. Even if the new rules do not require extensive changes on any plane, they will affect virtually all United States airliners with 30 seats or more, which is more than 6,000 aircraft. In October 1999, when the aviation agency first proposed the new inspection and maintenance rules that it now plans to issue next week, it said the rules would reduce the frequency of fuel tank explosions by 70 percent to 90 percent. Some airlines plan to argue that with the rules going into effect, there is little reason to proceed with the proposal to pump inert gas into fuel tanks. Since the explosion of Flight 800, a Boeing 747, the agency has issued 40 rules, covering a variety of aircraft. One such rule, issued last week, required operators of Boeing 737's to update their pilot's manuals, to re-emphasize to crews not to run the fuel pumps in the center tanks when the tanks are empty. Those pumps are cooled and lubricated by the fuel, and if the tank is empty, they can generate heat; if the tank has vapors in it, the vapors can ignite. The order last week came after a 737 exploded at a gate in Bangkok; investigators believe the center tank pump was running. The ignition source on T.W.A. 800 has never been determined, although investigators found damaged wiring and other potential sources. Last month the aviation agency bought an old 747 from United Airlines for its laboratory in Atlantic City, where the agency is testing techniques for preventing explosions in the center tank. Experts say they could pump an inert gas, nitrogen, into mostly empty tanks, so they could not support combustion. The planes could also carry such tanks in the air or carry nitrogen generators. As fuel tanks gradually empty in flight, the space can fill with fumes; in flight, however, the tanks are cooled by frigid high-altitude air, and cold fuel does not easily turn to vapor. In the Bangkok case, as in T.W.A. 800, the plane had sat on the ground on a hot day with its air conditioners running to keep the cabin cool; in the 737 and 747 design, that has the effect of heating the center fuel tank. The rules issued so far, and the ones to be issued next week, represent a shift in safety philosophy since the T.W.A. 800 crash, which killed all 230 people aboard. Before the crash, the aviation agency believed that safety could be assured by preventing any ignition source in the tank. Under pressure from the National Transportation Safety Board, and after extensive research, officials no longer believe that this is possible."
"Although it may be some time before investigators determine the precise cause of the explosion that killed three firefighters in Queens on Sunday, fire officials said yesterday that early indications pointed to flammable liquids that were stored in a basement. ''I think all of the things they were permitted to store could cause an explosion like this, depending on how much of it had escaped from the containers, how hot it was at that point, how long it was burning,'' said Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen. That assessment was based on interviews with firefighters and other information gathered in the hours after Sunday's five-alarm blaze at the Long Island General Supply Company, on Astoria Boulevard at 14th Street. Commissioner Von Essen said investigators were still uncertain what had ignited the original blaze. However, early theories about the explosion point to the basement, where investigators believe that a few small cans of an unspecified liquid ruptured and the fumes from those cans set off the explosion. Law enforcement officials said investigators were also pursuing the possibility that two boys, 13 and 15, had spilled gasoline outside the building and that it had somehow seeped into the basement, where it ignited. The officials said the two boys were being interviewed last night and the theory was being seriously considered. Investigators also believe that the explosion occurred in the basement because firefighters in the building at the time said the floor heaved upward with enough force to propel 200-pound firefighters wearing 100 pounds of equipment into the air. ''Reports from firefighters on the first floor said that the explosion caused them to be lifted up and thrown against the ceiling,'' Commissioner Von Essen said. The commissioner said the store was stocked with a variety of flammable substances, including benzene, paint thinners, propane, varnish and oil-based paints. The store's owners, officials said, had permits to sell everything but benzene. The store's owners did not need a permit for propane as long as they had fewer than 156 one-pound cylinders, Commissioner Von Essen said. However, regulations prohibit propane from being stored below ground -- and officials said that one of the store's representatives had told them that some of the propane was being stored in the basement. ''We'll probably give them a summons for that,'' Commissioner Von Essen said. ''We have no reason to believe at this point that was the cause of the explosion or that it exacerbated the explosion.'' Commissioner Von Essen said none of the annual inspections by the Bureau of Fire Prevention, which regulates hazardous-materials permits, turned up any serious violations -- most were along the lines of a blocked aisle or rubbish in the yard. ''We have nothing to tell us that this businessman was doing anything wrong at this point'' with respect to anything that might have caused the explosion, Commissioner Von Essen said. Asked what was stored in the basement of the hardware store, Randy Spencer, an owner of the store, said, ''Everything that's legally allowed to be sold by a hardware store.'' He refused to answer questions about whether there was benzene or propane in the basement. The explosion did not appear to be natural-gas-related, Commissioner Von Essen said, because gas meters were intact and no one reported a gas smell. Nor, he said, was there evidence so far to suggest a lapse in procedure by the firefighters. Correction: June 21, 2001, Thursday An article on Tuesday about the investigation of the Queens fire in which three firefighters died on Sunday misstated the surname of an owner of the hardware store where it occurred. He is Randy Gordon, not Spencer."
"Yesterday was supposed to be John Downing's last day at Rescue Company 4 in Woodside, Queens, before he, his wife and two young children headed to Ireland for a long-awaited vacation. As is tradition at the 55-member firehouse, Mr. Downing bought lunch for many of the men, a jovial group described as ''a brotherhood'' by some who knew them. It was not long after the meal was finished that a siren rang out, and red engines went screeching down Queens Boulevard toward Astoria and a fire at the Long Island General Supply Company. About a half-hour later an explosion ripped through the building where the hardware store was on the ground floor, trapping Mr. Downing and two colleagues, Firefighters Harry Ford and Brian Fahey. All three died. By last night, dozens of firefighters had gathered at Rescue 4 -- some crying, others speechless, some gaining strength from stories about happier days. They left their own Father's Day barbecues and families to remember the men who yesterday, on the day meant to honor them, together left eight children and three wives. ''Fifty-five firefighters work here,'' Thomas DaParma, a retired firefighter, said last night at Rescue 4. ''And 55 are here right now, every single one of them.'' A priest traveled between Rescue 4 and the nearby firehouse, Ladder Company 163, offering words of comfort and prayers. There were light moments, such as when one firefighter recalled the day ''Harry told another firefighter he stunk at golf.'' Mr. DaParma said: ''There's no rhyme or reason to it. These were three experienced firefighters. They knew their jobs, they knew their jobs well.'' One former paramedic who knew two of the men who died began to share his feelings: ''There are no words to express . . .,'' he said, before he choked up. Later, he added: ''They don't get the recognition or respect they deserve. They know the risks and still do the job. They're real heroes.''"
"Forty-two people were injured yesterday when part of a cooling and ventilation unit exploded in the basement of a downtown office building, officials said. The injured, 38 of whom were firefighters, were treated at hospitals. None of the injuries appeared life-threatening, officials said. Three of the firefighters were admitted to the burn unit at the New York Weill Cornell Center. They were in stable condition last night, the hospital said. The explosion occurred around 1:20 p.m. at 1 New York Plaza, officials said, while firefighters were preparing to leave the building after having extinguished a small blaze that broke out at a construction site there hours earlier. Fire companies initially responded to the building, at Whitehall and State Streets, around noon when sparks from a construction worker's demolition saw set off a small fire in the subbasement, fire officials said. The construction crew had been dismantling a chiller unit that was part of the building's heating, ventilation and cooling system, officials said. After that fire had been put out, and firefighters were preparing to leave, there was a large explosion. The subbasement rattled, witnesses said. Smoke was everywhere. Firefighters carried dozens of their injured colleagues out of the building by using a ramp from an underground parking garage that leads up to the street. Witnesses said the force of the blast was so intense that it could be felt through inches-think cinder-block walls. ''It blew me across the room,'' said Michael Ward, 33, a carpenter from Woodside, Queens, who was helping set Sheetrock in another part of the subbasement. ''Bricks were flying. Things were coming off the ceiling. There was smoke and dust everywhere. It was a mess. ''I was very scared and in shock for about 30 seconds and then I realized, I've got to get out of here.'' Fire officials said they were still trying to determine the cause of the explosion, which started another fire. ''This was a pretty powerful explosion,'' said Chief John Norman of the Fire Department's special operations unit. ''People were lucky their injuries weren't more serious.'' Although contained, the fire continued to burn into last night. That, said Chief Norman, was a necessary precaution because of the intense heat from the still-burning titanium rods that made up the chiller unit. ''The titanium rods are burning at 5,000 degrees,'' the chief said. ''And we're going to let it burn itself out.'' Adding water to metal rods already at such a high temperature created the danger of a second explosion, Chief Norman said. Despite the severity of the blast, fire officials said there were no immediate signs of structural damage to the building. N.Y. Region"
"When he was taken to the emergency room at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens in late June, Joseph Vosilla's pelvis was crushed, most of his ribs were broken and several of his internal organs were ruptured. For more than a week, his doctors doubted that Mr. Vosilla, 41, one of dozens of firefighters who had been injured battling a ferocious hardware-store blaze that killed three of their colleagues, would survive. But yesterday morning, after two months of treatment and several operations, Firefighter Vosilla, wrapped in a white cotton blanket emblazoned with ''F.D.N.Y.'' and strapped to a gurney, was wheeled out of the hospital, smiling and chewing gum as he was greeted by cheering firefighters, tearful relatives, a bagpipe tribute and shouts of ''Go Joe!'' He was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, where he is expected to undergo rehabilitation for at least five weeks. ''I feel lucky'' said Firefighter Vosilla, who was surrounded by his mother, Renata Vosilla; Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen; and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani near the main entrance of the hospital on Broadway, where the sidewalk looked like the scene of a small but raucous parade. ''But, unfortunately for the brothers who passed away on the job . . .'' he said, his voice trailing off for a moment. ''Let's bow our heads and pause for them and their families.'' On June 17, Father's Day, the Long Island General Supply Company, a hardware store in Astoria, caught fire when a teenager rummaging for a can of spray paint outside the store knocked over a jug of gasoline, which leaked into the basement and was ignited by the pilot light from a water heater. The fire, which has since been ruled an accident, touched off an explosion that killed Firefighters Harry Ford, 50, Brian Fahey, 46, and John J. Downing, 40, trapping one of them in a smoke-filled corner and crushing the other two under a wall that collapsed. Firefighter Vosilla, an 11-year veteran who is a member of Ladder Company 116 in Astoria, was working closely with Firefighters Ford and Downing and was crushed by the same wall that tumbled onto them. Yesterday, he said he vividly remembered being trapped in the debris. ''I actually even remembered being buried under the bricks, knowing that I couldn't move out,'' he said. ''I just told myself to relax, take a couple of breaths. I knew I had good people around me and they were going to come and help me.'' One of those people was Firefighter Dave Schleyer, also of Ladder Company 116, who said he had escaped becoming trapped by mere seconds and later helped carry Firefighter Vosilla into an ambulance. Since the fire, Firefighter Schleyer, like many of the firefighters from Ladder Company 116 and Engine Company 261, which share a firehouse in Astoria, has regularly visited Firefighter Vosilla at the hospital. The worst time was when he was unconscious for several days, in an induced coma, and his family, friends and fellow firefighters sat by his side watching him and looking for signs that he was going to be all right. ''I always thought he would make it, I really did,'' Firefighter Schleyer said. Firefighter Vosilla, who is still unable to walk, was upbeat yesterday about his progress, if somber about his fallen colleagues. ''There will be a much bigger party when I get out of there,'' he said of his stay at Mount Sinai, ''because I'll be walking out of there.'' Later, as he was settling into his new room, he said by telephone that he was heartened by the well-wishing. ''It felt great,'' he said. ''It was very inspirational.''"
"What piled on him Tuesday morning, said Roger Parrino, was wind and dust, not flame and steel. So he washed it off and marched back to work as the lieutenant in a detective squad, looking just about the same as he did a week ago. Yet all is changed, utterly changed. ''I'm not going to be the same guy,'' said Mr. Parrino, 40, married and the father of two sons. ''And I'm not going to pretend that life isn't going to be different. I'm saying hello to every one I see on the street.'' Many who had close encounters with death on Tuesday are finding that not just the skyline has been altered; their own interior landscapes have been rearranged in ways that are still unfolding. For the second time in a decade, Chuck Meara had to evacuate 1 World Trade Center because of a terrorist attack. He walked down the 68 floors, crossing paths with dozens of young firefighters on the way up, lugging coils of hoses, picks, axes, the tools of their trade. They were greeted, he remembers, with cheers. Mr. Meara, 51, who is married with no children, works in the government and community affairs department of the Port Authority. He had left behind his own tools: a careful calendar, an old-fashioned Rolodex. ''Now I'm wondering, is it Thursday or Friday?'' Mr. Meara said.''And I'm thinking, who cares?'' He found himself replaying the scene in the stairwell, as thousands departed not knowing that they would never return, and the faces of the men bravely ascending to their death. Within hours, Mr. Meara discovered how far the apron of his life was spread. Nephews, nieces, relatives from across the country had jammed his answering machine, asking after him. For people across the globe, he noted, the dead and missing are not a vague numerical abstraction. ''I must have gotten 50 or 60 calls just from my direct family,'' he said. ''And then you think that has to be multiplied by everyone who might have been in the Trade Center that morning. How many? 20,000 30,000 people? From all over the world?'' No one can keep the losses of this week at arm's length; the dead and missing are no more than just a few links away in the chain of kinship or acquaintance. Mr. Parrino has a brother-in-law who may have lost a brother-in-law. His own wife had been scheduled to attend a seminar on the 106th floor, but decided not to go. And he narrowly missed becoming one of those links. After Mr. Parrino dropped off their children at a Midtown school, he heard the news and pointed himself toward the trade center. He assigned himself to look up at the rear of the jetliner jammed into the tower, trying -- ridiculously, he now says -- to write a description of the parts. At the moment the first building collapsed, he was huddling with firefighters and E.M.S. workers so that he could get the names and addresses of anyone they took out of the building. They took shelter in 225 Liberty Street. ''When I came outside, I thought I had come out a different way than I came in, because the building wasn't there any more,'' said Mr. Parrino. As he worked his way north, trying to find the next command post, he had a shattering conversation with a police sergeant. ''He told me, 'I just lost 16 of mine,' '' Mr. Parrino said. He saw a gang of paramedics line up stretchers at the base of the building. ''That's when the second building went,'' he said. He fled north, orienting himself along a cyclone fence. Finally, he dove against a curb. ''In the Marines, they trained us put our bellies on the ground and point our feet toward an explosion,'' said Mr. Parrino. A tremendous wind blast gave him the feeling that his head was being pushed into a pillow. He was suffocating. He pulled himself to one knee, spitting up dust. Both Mr. Parrino and Mr. Meara recalled the utter blackness that followed the wind; they remember meeting people who gave them water and help. They were able to talk clinically about the wind, almost as if it were a force of nature. When they spoke about acts of kindness, they had a different tone: these acts had a mysterious power. Mr. Parrino could barely speak about the strangers who helped him. Their marriages have taken on a new glow. ''I appreciate my wife and my children even more,'' Mr. Parrino said. And Mr. Meara noted: ''It's just the two of us.'' Mr. Parrino talked about a sister in Florida who had been praying for him when the second tower collapsed. ''I'm not a religious person,'' he said, ''but call it luck, call it the hand of God.'' They returned to work quickly. Mr. Meara attended a City Council meeting yesterday as the Port Authority's representative. He finds that he is not so concerned about the rescheduled election, though he notes that the country always has held them in wartime. He recalled that as the survivors moved down the stairs, firefighters had told them to walk away and not to look back, a caution against falling debris. ''When we left Manhattan that night, I couldn't look at the skyline,'' said Mr. Meara. ''I still can't.'' As for Mr. Parrino, he finished his shift in East Harlem yesterday and headed back to the trade center, to carry buckets or anything else. ''It's something I've got to do,'' he said. AFTER THE ATTACKS: CLOSE CALLS"
"At St. Charlie's restaurant on Albany Street, two blocks south of the World Trade Center, the tables were still set for a lunch that was never served. In the bar, some of the stools were still perched upside down on a table, but St. Charlie's had a new name scrawled in the dust of one of the few unbroken windows. ''Ground Zero Bar, Open 24 hours, no cover.'' On the chalkboard over the bar, someone had written, ''Free drinks for all workers.'' And, exhausted from days of grueling rescue work, the stress practically coming out of their ears in bursts of steam, the workers took advantage. At noon one day last week, a burly ironworker was pouring a healthy dose of Jameson's whiskey into a plastic water bottle. The bartender, Willie Otero, 27, who was the maintenance man at St. Charlie's before the explosion, handed the man a beer. ''It's cold,'' the drinker said incredulously. By 4 p.m. Mr. Otero had disappeared, and the ironworker and three other men in hard hats were behind the bar serving a growing crowd of policemen, soldiers and firefighters, many with American flags stuck in their hard hats. The place took on the rowdy feel of a bar in a mining town. The sad Irish song ''Danny Boy,'' rendered by Noel Houlihan, 30, a volunteer rescue worker, had never sounded sadder. But there were desperately festive moments as well. Someone piled cigarette cartons and cigars on the bar. Three cases of beer were ferreted from a closet. A man with a flashlight came up from the basement with a case of merlot. A woman who had been cataloguing body parts at the morgue all day arrived. ''Everyone in here deserves a beer,'' said Tommy Tierney, 32. No one disagreed. ''A toast to New York's finest!'' someone yelled as two firemen posed on the ledge of what was once a window but was now just a flimsy curtain, an intravenous bag dangling above it. Mr. Tierney, who had spent the day picking through debris and thinking about the three friends he had lost in the explosion, put his fingers in his mouth and whistled, loudly. ''A moment of silence!'' he demanded, and the clamor stopped. ''And let some spill for those no longer with us,'' he added after a moment, and all across the room splatters of beer hit the ash-covered floor. AFTER THE ATTACKS: GROUND ZERO"
"Hope of rescuing 65 coal miners trapped underground here began to fade Monday afternoon as mine officials reported that they had not yet been able to excavate the collapsed tunnels leading to the men. The miners were sealed in a pitch black, airless hell at 2:30 a.m. Sunday when built-up methane gas exploded, causing the three main tunnels leading underground to collapse. By late afternoon on Monday, rescuers had tunneled through about 400 yards of rubble but still had not broken through. Gov. Humberto Moreira Vald√©s of Coahuila State, where the mine is situated, said the trapped men were believed to be in three groups about 150 yards below ground. The tunnels leading down to them, however, are sloped and are more than a mile and a half long. ''There's blockage from the explosion that's impeding passage into the mine,'' the governor said Monday morning. ''We don't know how far we have to go to eliminate that blockage.'' The miners were equipped with six hours of oxygen in small tanks on their belts, and mine officials said they were pumping air into ventilation shafts, but it remained unclear whether any of that oxygen had reached the trapped men. Hundreds of family members of the trapped men kept a desperate vigil outside the gate to the coal mine, known as Unidad Pasta de Conchos No. 8. ''It's hard, it's exhausting,'' said Juanita S√°nchez, 43, whose brother-in-law Margarito Cruz, 40, was buried below. ''As long as they don't carry them out dead, we have to hope they are alive.'' Several family members said the miners, who earn about $50 a week, had complained to them in recent weeks about excess methane gas, poor ventilation, crumbling walls and weak tunnel supports. ''This is not as safe as the other mines,'' said Jorge Alberto Mart√≠nez, a 24-year-old miner whose father, Juli√°n, 42, was trapped in the mine. The son, who also worked in the mine until five months ago, said: ''They use posts and beams here instead of steel arches. The ventilation is too little. When there is gas you can feel your ears whine.'' State officials and the owners of the mine said it had passed an inspection earlier this month with 47 minor infractions, all of which, they contended, had been fixed. Rub√©n Escudero, the manager of Industrial Minera M√©xico, which owns the mine, said the levels of methane gas in the shafts were less than 1 percent at the time of the explosion. The mine's machinery is designed to shut off automatically if the level exceeds that threshold, he said. Mr. Escudero said: ''Like all operations, it is subject to human risk and, of course, to mechanical breakdowns, which we go about fixing as they arise. Nothing is perfect.'' But many miners and miners' wives said something had obviously gone horribly wrong with that system. By 4:30 p.m., tempers were growing short in the crowd of family members. Then Sergio Robles Garza, the state director of civil protection, said the rescue workers had changed their tactics, trying to open an air shaft, which was the least badly collapsed of three tunnels leading into the mine. Family members responded by shouting that the rescue workers should have tried to enter the mine through a different route earlier in the day and were wasting precious time. The last big mining accident in this northern border state, which produces most of Mexico's coal, came in 1969, when 153 miners perished at the Barroter√°n Mine. In 1939, 67 died in an accident at the Palo√∫ Mine No. 5."
"Scores of coal miners were trapped deep underground early on Sunday morning when a gas explosion caused an avalanche of rock that sealed off a mine shaft in the border state of Coahuila, state authorities said. The explosion and landslide occurred at about 2:30 a.m. in a mine known as Unidad Pasta de Conchos in the municipality of San Juan de Sabinas, about 85 miles southwest of Eagle Pass, Tex., a spokesman for the state governor, Humberto Moreira Valdez, said here in Saltillo, the regional capital. An estimated 78 miners were working in the mine when the explosion and avalanche took place, according to local news reports. Paramedics, firefighters, police officers and volunteers were trying late Sunday to locate the trapped miners. The workers had located and rescued at least 13 of the miners in the hours since the accident, most of them with burn injuries, and transported them to a hospital, officials said. The Mexican military cordoned off an area a mile wide around the site for the rescue operation. The governor's spokesman, David Aguill√≥n, said the remaining miners, believed to number at least 65, were trapped about 150 yards underground. He said emergency crews were scrambling to reach them before their air runs out. There were no immediate reports of deaths. The cause of the explosion also remained unknown, though some reports suggested a buildup of gas in the mine had somehow been ignited. Daniel Romo of Coahuila's emergency services department told The Associated Press that some of the rescued miners had severe burns and broken bones. ''Their lives are not in danger,'' he said. The mine is owned by Grupo Mexico, a Mexico City-based company that is the world's fourth-largest copper producer, a mining union spokeswoman told Bloomberg News Service. Consuelo Aguilar, a spokeswoman for the National Miners Union, was quoted by The A.P. as saying said there has been concern over safety conditions in Grupo Mexico mines. ''We have pressured for better safety conditions as well as for better pay at the mines,'' she said. In one of Mexico's worst mine disasters, in 1969, more than 150 coal miners died when an explosion caused tunnels to collapse, also in the state of Coahuila. Coahuila is the country's top coal-producing state, feeding the furnaces of Mexican steel and power industries. Sergio Guajardo, a Red Cross spokesman, told Reuters that rescue efforts were focused on pumping out the explosive gases, which also can suffocate miners. ''Right now we are working on getting out the gas,'' he said. ''The ventilators are working at full speed.''"
"At least 11 people, including four children walking to school, were killed in a surge of bombings and assassinations in the capital on Wednesday. One of the deadliest attacks was in central Baghdad, where a concealed bomb exploded in the morning in a crowded market area on a street where many children walk to school, an Interior Ministry official and witnesses said. Four children died in the bombing, said Thamir Hamid, 40, the owner of a convenience store near the explosion site. ''Look at the human remains on the wall,'' Mr. Hamid said, pointing to bits of flesh splattered across brick archways in the marketplace, in the Fadel neighborhood. ''One of the bodies was headless. The mother recognized it from the shoes.'' The bomb may have been aimed at liquor stores along the street. Since the American-led invasion, which has resulted in a strengthening of fundamentalist religious mores across Iraq, liquor vendors have come under relentless attack, with street salesmen being shot and shops bombed. In the southern city of Basra, it is virtually impossible now to find anyone openly selling liquor, and Baghdad is quickly heading in that direction. The Associated Press reported that three of the dead children were siblings, citing police officers and the father of the children, Jamil Muhammad, a merchant. ''We only wanted to live a decent life,'' Mr. Muhammad said, sobbing at the local police station. ''What is the guilt of my dead children? They were only heading to school.'' At the site, the owner of a cosmetics store, Atheer al-Bayati, was trying to rearrange a shelf of overturned bottles. ''They just want to create chaos,'' Mr. Bayati, 32, said, his floor littered with shards of glass. ''We live with the ultimate fact that even at home you don't feel safe. They even bomb mosques.'' A car bomb exploded in Baghdad at noon, killing four policemen and wounding another policeman and three civilians, the Interior Ministry official said. Another bomb in a car parked near a Shiite mosque in the Karada neighborhood killed one civilian and wounded five other civilians and three traffic policemen. In the early afternoon, a former security official and a policeman were gunned down in separate attacks in the neighborhood of Al Amel. In the northern city of Kirkuk, dozens of Kurds took to the streets to demand that Turkey release Abdullah Ocalan, an imprisoned Kurdish guerrilla leader. Mr. Ocalan, who was arrested in 1999, was the leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, an armed separatist group based in the Kurdish-dominated region of southeastern Turkey. While many Kurds support the group, the Turkish government and the Bush administration have labeled it a terrorist organization, accusing it of carrying out attacks that have killed many civilians. To contain any outbreak of bird flu, the Ministry of Health ordered the borders of the impoverished southern province of Maysan sealed off and told people there to start slaughtering chickens and other birds, a ministry spokesman, Qasim Yahia Allawi, said Wednesday. The announcement came after Iraqi and American doctors said Sunday that health officials were studying six suspected cases of bird flu in Amara, the capital of Maysan. The marshlands of the south, rich in fowl and other wildlife, lie partly in Maysan. ''The minister of health is now in the south visiting the provinces there in order to carry out the ministry's plans to stop the disease of bird flu,'' Mr. Allawi said in a telephone interview. ''The minister has ordered the closing of the borders of Maysan Province.'' THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE INSURGENCY"
"How would New York City respond if a bomb filled with arsenic trichloride, a highly toxic liquid compound, were to explode on a freight train moving through a Queens railyard -- just when a commuter train carrying weekend passengers was traveling in the other direction? Emergency workers would rush in, try to determine what threat was involved and begin decontaminating the dozens of wounded. A temporary morgue would be set up to receive the dead -- estimated at 28, including two of the rescuers. That nightmarish situation was the basis for a four-hour simulation yesterday involving 1,500 police officers, firefighters and other emergency workers and tested the city's ability to respond to a chemical emergency, though not necessarily a terrorist attack. The Office of Emergency Management planned the field exercise, named Trifecta because it emphasized three activities: search and rescue, victim identification and handling of the dead. Despite the grim nature of the exercise -- the casualties would have included 74 injured -- the commissioner of emergency management, Joseph F. Bruno, said it demonstrated the effectiveness of the Citywide Incident Management System, a protocol that governs how various city agencies are to interact during a major emergency. ''I'm happy and I'm actually a little surprised that it worked as well as it did,'' Mr. Bruno said at an afternoon news conference, after most of the exercise had been completed. A critical element of the response plan gives the Police Department overall command of the city's emergency agencies in most major disasters, at least until the possibility of terrorism has been ruled out. The Fire Department had sought control of several types of situations, including those that involve hazardous materials. The plan, which took effect under an executive order signed last April by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, was prepared after a lengthy examination of poor coordination and communication among city agencies, particularly the Police and Fire Departments, during the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001. Yesterday was the first major field test of that agreement. Police commanders set up a ''unified command,'' which provided for top officials from the police, fire, health, environmental protection and other departments to make joint decisions. ''It's a matter of respecting their core competencies,'' Mr. Bruno said. Although police and fire officials clashed during the formation of the plan, leaders from both sides said yesterday that it was effective. ''I think CIMS is clearly the way to go, and I believe it's been accepted by all the agencies,'' Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said. Frank P. Cruthers, first deputy commissioner at the Fire Department, said the test was ''a very realistic exercise'' and added, ''The level of cooperation was terrific.'' The exercise, financed by $700,000 from the federal Department of Homeland Security, began with a mock explosion at 10 a.m. in the railyard at Maspeth, Queens, an industrial neighborhood dominated by factories and warehouses. The New York & Atlantic Railway provided the freight train for the exercise, while the Metropolitan Transportation Authority supplied a Long Island Rail Road passenger train. Several federal and state agencies participated, as did nonprofit groups including the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army. The Fire Department was the first to respond after the simulated explosion, followed by the Police and Environmental Protection Departments. ''When you look at this incident, it seemed at first to move very slowly in the beginning,'' Mr. Bruno said afterward. ''That's just the way it has to. We do not know if there are other explosive devices here. We do not know the nature of the chemical.'' Once the various officials evaluated the danger, he said, they made ''good, crisp decisions.'' Mr. Bruno said the exercise proceeded with only a few glitches. At one point, he said, a centralized operations post had to be separated from the command post because ''there was too much confusion.'' Since 9/11, the city has had other drills involving the premise of a terrorist attack, including one at Shea Stadium in March 2004 and another at the Bowling Green subway station, in Lower Manhattan, in May 2004."
"At least 75 Iraqis were killed and scores injured Tuesday as insurgents carried out their deadliest offensive in weeks. Most of the victims died in five powerful bombings in Baghdad, which threatened to heighten tensions as Iraqis struggled to recover from the worst sectarian bloodletting of the war. Though politicians and clerics have been calling for calm, and a weekend curfew cooled off the fury in the streets, people across the capital remained anxious over the possibility of new sectarian violence. Militiamen and private guards stood watch at mosques, and the American ambassador declared that last week's killings had pushed Iraq ''to the brink of civil war.'' The cabinet said Tuesday afternoon that 379 people had died and 458 had been injured in the violence since the bombing last Wednesday of a sacred Shiite shrine in Samarra and in the anti-Sunni reprisal killings that followed. After meeting with the country's most powerful cleric, the Iraqi national security adviser warned that leaders would take ''a few months'' to form a new government, and that negotiations would proceed along a ''rough road with a lot of political mines in our way.'' American and Iraqi officials fear that bitter, prolonged negotiations will undermine faith in the politicians, reinforce sectarian divisions and strengthen the insurgency. The Bush administration is gambling that the political process will help stabilize Iraq -- and provide an exit for some of the 130,000 American troops here -- by drawing in recalcitrant Sunni Arabs, who are leading the insurgency. In Washington, President Bush declined to say whether the violence of the past week would affect the administration's hopes of reducing the American troop presence. American officials have been saying they would like to get the number of troops down to 100,000 or so by year's end. ''The people of Iraq and their leaders must make a choice,'' Mr. Bush said to reporters. ''The choice is chaos or unity.'' On Tuesday, blast after blast rocked the capital. After one car bomb exploded at noon in a Shiite district of downtown Baghdad, firefighters and witnesses struggled to pry two blackened bodies from a charred sedan. The wailing crowd lifted the bodies out, shouted, ''God is great!'' and marched down the street bearing the bodies aloft. Nuns from a nearby convent rushed toward the flaming wrecks clutching buckets of water. An Interior Ministry official said at least six people had been killed and 18 wounded in that bombing. Around the same time, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives at a gasoline station in a Shiite neighborhood in southern Baghdad, killing at least 23 people and wounding 51. The deadliest attack took place in the evening, when a car bomb exploded by a marketplace in the northern Hurriya neighborhood, killing at least 25 and wounding at least 43. An explosion there in the morning devastated a Sunni mosque, continuing the string of attacks on houses of worship. No one was inside. In Tikrit, a bomb damaged the mosque where Saddam Hussein's father is buried. After the first attack, the Iraqi Islamic Party, a conservative Sunni political group, denounced the Shiite-led government, saying it was in ''collusion with the criminals who have gone too far in destroying God's houses and igniting riots.'' The tough language threatened to undo some of the recent gestures of reconciliation among the leaders of the country's political groups. The sectarian clashes last week subsided only after Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish leaders appeared together in televised meetings and prayer services. ''I think the country came to the brink of civil war,'' the American ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, said Monday on CNN. ''But Iraqis decided that they didn't want to go down that path and came together.'' That was the most explicit acknowledgment by an administration official of the degree to which sectarian strife had destabilized Iraq. It also contradicted declarations from American generals last week that Iraq was nowhere near a civil war. On Tuesday, the cabinet released statistics on people killed, saying officials wanted to correct figures that had appeared in an article in The Washington Post, which reported that 1,300 people had died in five days. The article cited officials at the Baghdad morgue. But the top two directors of the morgue said Tuesday morning that they had received only 246 bodies in the capital, where most of the killing had taken place. Of those, only about 70 have been claimed, they said. The Iraqi national security adviser, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, said Tuesday that security forces had arrested 10 people in connection with the bombing of the golden-domed Askariya Shrine in Samarra last Wednesday. Four were shrine guards, and six were ''terrorists,'' he said. Mr. Rubaie, a conservative Shiite, made his comments in the southern city of Najaf after meeting there with Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most powerful Shiite cleric. ''I expect we will go down a rough road with a lot of political mines in our way to forming a new government,'' Mr. Rubaie said, ''and I think the formation will take a few months, so I ask our people to be patient.'' The British military said Tuesday that two soldiers had been killed when their patrol was ambushed in the southern city of Amara, and the American military said a soldier had been killed Monday by small-arms fire west of Baghdad. At least 2,296 members of the American military have died in the war. In Baghdad, 9 people were killed and 17 wounded by one car bomb, The Associated Press reported. A roadside bomb aimed at a Defense Ministry adviser killed five soldiers and wounded seven others. In Khalis, gunmen killed four policemen, Reuters reported. Northeast of the capital, in Baquba, an imam, a policeman and an interpreter for the Americans were killed in separate incidents. South of the city, the police found nine bullet-riddled bodies along a stretch of road. THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: VIOLENCE"
"Forty-one hours after an explosion trapped 13 men in a West Virginia coal mine here, family members and a state official said 12 of the miners had been found alive Tuesday night. Earlier Tuesday evening, the body of one miner was found 11,200 feet from the mine entrance, within a few hundred feet of a vehicle used to transport the workers deep into the mine, company officials said. The miner was not identified, and the cause of his death was unclear. Joe Thornton, deputy secretary for the West Virginia Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety, said the rescued miners were being examined at the mine shortly before midnight and would soon be taken to nearby hospitals. Mr. Thornton said he did not know details of their medical condition. Outside the Sago Baptist Church, where people had gathered across the street from the mine, family and friends of the miners hugged each other and shed tears of joy as they learned the news. ''It's a miracle,'' said Loretta Ables, who said her fianc√©, Fred Ware, was among the survivors. ''Everyone was telling us they were probably dead.'' Earlier in the ordeal, air readings from a hole drilled 260 feet into the mine had revealed extremely high levels of toxic carbon monoxide, a likely byproduct of the explosion, mine company officials said. After the one miner's body was found alone, Bennett K. Hatfield, the chief executive officer of International Coal Group, the mine's owner, said he considered it a hopeful sign that the other miners had abandoned the vehicle and found a safe pocket of air. Terry Goff, a friend of one of the miners, said he learned that the miners were alive when the bell at the Baptist church began ringing just before midnight. ''People were rushing out, yelling, 'There's 12 alive!' '' Mr. Goff said. ''When they found the body and said the carbon monoxide levels were high, I doubted my faith,'' he said, ''but now we've got 12 men walking off that hill.'' Throughout the day, trained rescue teams equipped with oxygen canisters had rotated through the mine, meticulously repairing the damaged ventilation system and combing through the mazelike corridors for the men. Emotions seesawed throughout the day with each new piece of information. In the morning, hopes had run high that the miners, most of them highly experienced workers in their 40's and 50's, had barricaded themselves in a corridor with breathable air to wait for a rescue party. By late afternoon, mine company officials said that with only a few thousand feet of mine left to search, the chances of the miners being alive seemed remote. But late in the evening, officials said the fact that 12 miners had apparently not been killed by the force of the explosion renewed hopes that they were alive. Nick Helms, who waited all day for news of his father, Terry, said his father, a strapping 50-year-old, had endured numerous injuries in a 30-year career and hated mining because of the dangers, but refused to quit because the job put food on the table. ''He gave his life in there so I could go to the movies,'' Mr. Helms, 25, said of his father. Switching to the present tense, Mr. Helms added, ''He is very selfless.'' The explosion, which occurred at about 6:30 Monday morning in an unused part of the mine that had been sealed just last month, shook homes and woke people nearby. But it did not cause extensive damage inside the mine, company officials said. Some concrete walls used to direct airflow had been knocked down by the force of the blast, but there were no cave-ins or piles of rubble from the explosion, officials said. The real danger to the miners, officials said, would have come from the persistent high levels of carbon monoxide inside the mine. A colorless, odorless gas, carbon monoxide impedes the body's ability to carry oxygen to vital organs. It can cause flulike symptoms like headaches and nausea, and in high enough quantities, it can kill a person in 15 minutes. Of particular danger to trapped miners, it can also cause confusion. By Tuesday evening, monitors showed carbon dioxide readings of more than 300 parts per million in some sections of the mine, more than 10 times the amount considered safe, company officials said. ''The CO2 was the worst thing they could find,'' said Bruce E. Dial of Pineville, N.C., who worked as a federal mine safety official for more than 20 years. Miners, after underground explosions or fires, are trained to find pockets of breathable air using special monitors, then barricade themselves in using a plastic-coated fabric known as brattice cloth. Lewis Wade, a mine safety expert and senior science adviser for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, said a well-sealed corridor could keep a miner alive for hours. ''Explosions are devastating things,'' Mr. Wade said, ''but miners are smart and resilient people.'' Federal inspectors fined the Sago mine more than $24,000 for roughly 202 violations in 2005, according to federal records. The total monetary figure is likely to rise substantially because the federal mine-safety agency has yet to put a dollar figure on some citations. The most serious of these citations are 16 ''unwarrantable failure orders,'' which are problems that an operator knows exist but fails to correct. Thirteen of these orders were issued in the past six months, federal records show. ''Under the Bush administration, the citing of unwarrantable failures has gone down dramatically,'' said Tony Oppegard, a top federal mine official in the Clinton administration and a former prosecutor of mine-safety violations in Kentucky. ''So to see a rash of unwarrantable failures under this administration is a telling sign of a mine with serious safety problems.'' Inspectors found dangerous accumulations of coal dust, which can be explosive. Other citations dealt with ventilation and firefighting equipment violations. Since June, the mine has experienced 15 roof falls or wall collapses, with three causing injuries to miners, according to federal records. That is an unusually high number, Mr. Oppegard said, ''and it's indicative of roof-control problems.'' Asked about the violations on Tuesday, Mr. Hatfield said the mine's ''bad history'' had occurred before his company took it over last year, adding that dramatic improvements had been made since then. The anxiety of the day was heightened by what seemed to be painfully slow progress by the rescue teams, which took the entire day to move 2,000 feet. But, experts said, the teams had to proceed cautiously, frequently testing the air and repairing the ventilation system, because of an array of dangers. A weakened roof could have caved in, for instance, or trapped methane could have triggered a second explosion. Dennis O'Dell, administrator of health and safety for the United Mine Workers of America, who was assisting in the search, said hasty rescue efforts had at times led to additional deaths. At the Blue Creek No. 5 Mine in Alabama in 2001, 10 men attempting to rescue trapped miners were killed in a second explosion. ''I know it's tough on families because every minute seems like an hour,'' Mr. O'Dell said. ''It's just something you have to do. Everybody has done as good a job here as I have seen.'' In one setback, a robot owned by the federal government became mired in mud inside the mine on Tuesday and was rendered unusable. Officials had hoped that the robot, equipped with lights, an air testing device and a video camera, would reach the trapped miners faster than human teams could. The cause of the blast remained a mystery. Company officials said that the mine did not have a history of methane gas problems and that air testing conducted before the explosion found no evidence of methane, a highly combustible gas. The apparent lack of methane led some mining experts to speculate that coal dust, which is highly combustible, caused the explosion. A spark from electrical equipment could ignite coal dust, they said. Mr. Hatfield said the likelihood of a coal dust explosion seemed low because no work had been done in the mine over the weekend. The trapped team was the first to enter the mine after the holiday layoff but had not begun work when the explosion occurred, he said. As a result, there would have been little or no coal dust in the air, he said. Lightning was another possible cause. The explosion happened during a violent thunderstorm, and Mr. O'Dell said there had been incidents in which metal pipes extruding from underground mines had conducted lightning bolts. The bolts then ignited pockets of methane gas, he said. Correction: January 7, 2006, Saturday A front-page article on Wednesday about the mine explosion in Sago, W.Va., referred incorrectly at one point to the gas that was present at high levels. As stated elsewhere in the article, it was carbon monoxide, not carbon dioxide."
"It is perhaps the most heartbreaking question raised by a heartbreaking accident. Did 12 miners die deep inside the Sago Mine because, instead of trying to walk to safety after an explosion, they waited for help that took too long to arrive? They apparently had enough oxygen in their respirators to last an hour or more and no wall of debris blocked their escape, mine company officials said. They could not have known it, but there was breathable air inside the mine, possibly just 2,000 feet away. Cut off from communications with the outside, surrounded by thick smoke and deep darkness, they might have believed a fire was raging ahead of them, or that the mine roof was in danger of collapsing. They might have become disoriented by carbon monoxide poisoning. Whatever the answer, they did what the textbooks instruct: they built a simple barricade out of plastic cloth in an alcove 13,000 feet from the mine portal and hunkered down to wait for help. That help arrived more than 40 hours later, when all but one were dead. ''If they had been able to walk another 1,500 feet, they might have made it,'' said Dennis O'Dell, the health and safety administrator for the United Mine Workers of America, who helped in the rescue. Autopsies by the state's chief medical examiner found that the 12 miners died of carbon monoxide intoxication, John Law, a spokesman for the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, said Friday. As state and federal investigators began a sweeping investigation of the accident, they have begun grappling with some of the most perplexing questions to have been raised about mine safety in memory. What caused the explosion, which apparently occurred in a sealed, abandoned part of the mine? What led to the miscommunication that caused the miners' families to believe for three hours that the men had been rescued? Why was one miner, Randal McCloy Jr., able to survive? And would a quicker response have saved the miners as they huddled behind their barricade, harboring their oxygen and scribbling notes to their families? There was no rescue team on the mine site, so teams had to be called in from other mines, a process that might have been slowed by holiday vacations, rescue officials said. The closest federal team, in Morgantown about 70 miles away, had lost members to attrition and took several more hours to deploy, said J. Davitt McAteer, a former assistant secretary of mine safety and health under the Clinton administration. And once the teams arrived at the site, equipment had to be mustered, maps reviewed and air quality tested. There were concerns about fire. The result was that the first teams did not enter the mine until more than 11 hours after the explosion, the mine company's owner, International Coal Group, said. Those delays might have been unavoidable, and it was not clear that the men could have been saved even with a faster response. But some experts assert that the delays point to broader problems in the nation's mine rescue system. A 1995 federal study concluded that the system was antiquated, losing people and poorly financed. But Mr. McAteer said few of those concerns had been addressed. ''Time is the enemy in mine rescues,'' said Mr. McAteer, now a vice president of Wheeling Jesuit University in West Virginia. ''Always is. You know that from the start.'' For the miners heading into the Sago Mine, which had been closed Saturday and Sunday for the New Year's holiday, the workweek began at 5 a.m. Monday at the dressing area. Less than an hour later, 26 men were joking their way down the incline to the mine, where they ducked out of a violent thunderstorm. Two small rail cars waited. One team of 13 -- including Martin Toler Jr., Jesse Jones, Randal McCloy Jr. and Terry Helms -- clambered into the first car. But Hoy Keith, 62, a miner for 31 years, said his crew had been left a runt rail car that could not fit them. A new car was found, and the second team left 10 minutes late. Those minutes might have saved them. The mine resembles a backward ''F,'' with the closest corridor called First Left, and the next one called Second Left. The first crew dropped Mr. Helms somewhere past First Left, then headed into Second Left. Minutes later, around 6:30 a.m., Mr. Keith's team reached First Left. Just then, what felt to them like a fist of hurricane-force wind punched through them. Somewhere ahead, something had exploded. Chunks of rock and coal pelted the miners. Sheets of dirt splattered their safety glasses. ''It filled my mouth full of mud, my nose full of mud, my ears full of coal dust,'' said Ron Grall, who is 63. ''I couldn't breathe.'' In seconds, the men got out of the car, donned respirators and groped for one another and then for the wall to guide them outside. After 700 or 800 feet, they heard shouts of ''Fresh air!'' Rescuers with a rail car met them and took them to the entrance. But Owen Jones, the foreman of the rescued crew, refused to stay put. With three rescuers, he headed back to search for his brother, Jesse Jones. ''Just about everybody was hollering for him to go home,'' Mr. Keith said. ''But people who had their heads knew he had a brother in there.'' The four got about 9,000 feet inside the mine before they turned back because of concerns about toxic air. On the other side of the explosion were 13 men. Mr. Helms, whose job included checking for methane gas, was hit with its full force. The other 12 were ahead of him in Second Left, where they would remain for the duration of the ordeal. Outside the mine, the rescue effort was slowly getting assembled. Mine officials called state and federal regulators, many of whom were still off for the holiday and had to be reached at home or on cellphones. Two teams from nearby Barbour County, who had a contract with the Sago Mine, were summoned, but supervisors knew that would not be enough, so they requested help from other mining companies. One of the first teams to arrive was from the Robinson Run mine near Fairmont, W.Va., owned by Consul Energy, about 50 miles away. Jeff Bienkoski, a 54-year-old member of that team, had just finished a 10-hour shift when he got the call at about 10 a.m. He gathered his equipment and raced to the mine, arriving after 12:30 p.m., he said, about six hours after the explosion is believed to have occurred. Mines are not required by federal law to have rescue teams on site provided such teams can arrive within two hours. Company officials declined to comment on when the first teams arrived in Sago. In the next few hours, several more of the specially trained teams arrived. But they were not allowed to go into the mine until nearly 6 p.m., more than 11 hours after the explosion, company officials said. Though it always takes time for teams to review maps, check equipment and develop a strategy, critics of the mining company, including the mine workers' union, have questioned why it took so long for the teams to be allowed into the mine. Matt Barkett, a spokesman for the mine's owner, said the main reason for the delay was concern about high carbon monoxide levels inside the mine, which were initially measured at 1,300 parts per million, enough to kill a person without a respirator within minutes. He said the high levels had raised concerns about fire. Once inside, the six- to eight-man teams worked meticulously, rotating through the mine in shifts. Mine rescues are extraordinarily dangerous because of the threat of secondary explosions, toxic gases and roof cave-ins. At a mine owned by Jim Walter Resources Inc. in Alabama, nine men who ran to the aid of some injured miners were killed in a secondary explosion in 2001. ''These mine rescue guys are eager, they aren't afraid of the devil,'' Mr. O'Dell said. ''Sometimes you've got to keep them from going too fast.'' Charles Ross, 54, who worked for 25 years on a mine rescue team for Consul Energy, said the rescuers must carefully check for damage to the roof. Concrete and metal walls used to direct the flow of air must be repaired to restore proper ventilation. The air must be repeatedly checked. And every square inch must be inspected for bodies or barricades. ''People don't realize how much work there is,'' Mr. Ross said. ''It's time consuming.'' Across the street from the mine entrance, relatives and friends had gathered at the Sago Baptist Church. Frustration was growing at the pace of the rescue. One of the people trying to soothe the families was Gov. Joe Manchin III, who had been in Atlanta on Monday morning to see West Virginia University play in the Sugar Bowl but flew home that afternoon as the magnitude of the accident became clear. For the rest of Monday and throughout the day Tuesday, family members waited for updates from the company. Then before 9 p.m. on Tuesday, company officials informed family members at the church that one miner's body had been found, but that there was still no sign of the others. People wailed in anguish, but Mr. Manchin saw a ray of hope. That miner was later identified as Mr. Helms. But the rail car a few hundred feet from his was empty. Even lunch pails had been taken. All that remained were casings from the miners' respirators. To Mr. Manchin, it seemed a sign that the miners had escaped the blast and did what they were supposed to do: found breathable air and built a barricade to keep the toxic air out. ''That would be our miracle scenario,'' said Lara Ramsburg, Mr. Manchin's spokeswoman. ''If you were looking for something to hang on to, this was something. You were thinking: they got out of there.'' About 11:45 Tuesday night, a call came from a ''fresh air'' rescue operation base deep inside the mine -- so called because workers do not need respirators. Though the exact wording of the call is uncertain, company officials say a roomful of people heard the same message: The 12 miners had been found, and all were alive. Pandemonium broke out inside the rescue command center. Someone used a cellphone to call people at the church with the news. The church bells began tolling and a celebration began. A joyful Mr. Manchin made his way from the church to the command center to seek confirmation, telling someone, ''Miracles do happen.'' But two miles inside the mine, there was only one survivor, Mr. McCloy, and the rescue team was struggling to stabilize and then move him to the fresh air base. When they reached that base, they called the command center with a new message: They were coming out with the one survivor. What caused the miscommunication is unclear. Mine company officials said it might have been the result of garbled transmissions by rescue workers wearing oxygen masks, or a misinterpretation of that transmission by the fresh air base. Mr. O'Dell said that sending messages from the mine was a three-step process, requiring radio calls between two rescue bases where miners were wearing oxygen masks to the fresh air base, which had a hard wire line to the command center. Mr. O'Dell said that the rescue workers he debriefed told him that the message they sent initially was, in essence, ''We found all 12 bodies. One is alive.'' But somehow that became, ''We found all 12 bodies. All are alive.'' A new transcript of radio communications between two emergency workers reflected the confusion that led to families believing for hours that 12 miners had survived. At 11:48 p.m. Tuesday, an emergency worker said, ''They did find them, and they're all O.K. I guess, so, I think we might be transporting them.'' When told 12 miners were being rescued, the emergency worker asked, ''And they're all alive?'' ''Uh, as far as I know,'' the other replied. In the chaos, a debate emerged over what to tell the families, if anything. Mr. O'Dell said he urged officials to tell the families there was a problem. ''We were sick in there knowing there was a celebration going on outside,'' he said. ''There was a moral obligation for the company to step up.'' But company officials said they did not want to upset the families with incomplete information, and they dispatched another rescue team into the mine to double check the condition of the miners, which took another two hours. Sometime after 2:30 a.m., company officials notified families at the church that only one man had survived. The church exploded in anger. It was not clear what position state and federal officials, who were theoretically in charge of the rescue operation, took in the debate. But Ms. Ramsburg defended the decision to wait. ''The company was honestly trying to make sure they had the most accurate information to pass on to these families,'' she said. The Baptist church in Sago grew quiet after the bodies were brought out and taken to a local school, where relatives identified them. Some relatives received notes found with the men. Mr. Toler wrote in uneven block letters, ''Tell all -- I see them on the other side. Jr.'' Along Route 20, the main road from Sago to Buckhannon, businesses edited signs that days before had expressed hope for a miracle. ''God Has 12 New Angels,'' said the sign outside the Go-Mart on Friday. At the church, journalists were largely gone on Friday. The mud their wheels had churned up in the driveway had disappeared under a fresh load of gravel: the first hint of repair in a community that remained broken. DISASTER AT THE MINE"
"Anniversaries of the three most somber milestones in the American program of human spaceflight are clustered in the days ahead. Each in its own tragic way represents a pivotal moment in space exploration. The two most recent disasters continue to haunt the program with lost momentum and persistent doubts about its value and future direction. Thirty-nine years ago, on Jan. 27, 1967, the three astronauts of Apollo 1 lost their lives in a fire on the launching pad. The training accident set back the successful attainment of the goal to land men on the Moon by the end of the decade, but did not prevent it. Twenty years ago, on Jan. 28, 1986, the space shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff, killing all on board, including a schoolteacher. The disaster was all the more stunning because it occurred in full view of the crowds at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and of millions watching on television. It was more than two and a half years before another shuttle flew. Three years ago, on Feb. 1, 2003, the shuttle Columbia broke apart over Texas on its return from orbit, killing the seven astronauts. It was again two and a half years before a shuttle returned to orbit, and it encountered a potentially disastrous problem. Although the mission was completed safely, flights were again suspended, and are not expected to resume earlier than May. At a news conference last week at Cape Canaveral, Fla., Michael D. Griffin, the NASA administrator, acknowledged that ''this is a time to think about those kinds of losses.'' He compared those experiences ''surrounded by black crepe'' with the many setbacks in the early days of air transportation. ''I think that is the perspective with which we have to look at our losses in spaceflight,'' Dr. Griffin said. ''We are, as fallible and flawed human beings, trying very hard to learn how to do something very, very difficult to do.'' But some experts outside the National Aeronautics and Space Administration say the program of human spaceflight has never really recovered from the Challenger disaster. Even before 1986, the shuttles had failed to live up to expectations as reliable and cost-effective reusable vehicles for carrying crews and cargo into orbit. ''The shuttle could never do what the agency tried to make it do, and so they traded off safety,'' said Alex Roland, a former NASA historian who is a professor of history at Duke University. ''I don't blame the managers; they were presented with an impossible job.'' The immediate flaw in the booster rockets that ignited the Challenger explosion was fixed, Dr. Roland and other critics say, but not the systemic engineering and management shortcomings. ''The proof is the Columbia accident,'' Dr. Roland said, noting that engineers had had warnings on prior flights of the fuel tank debris that damaged the shuttle wing and led to the craft's fatal disintegration. ''There was enormous pressure on the managers and they just kept flying with the problem, even though they could not explain why it was happening,'' he said. ''The law of averages caught up on Columbia.'' John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said human spaceflight had never recovered from the decision to build the program around the shuttles and then the International Space Station, the orbiting platform assembled and maintained mainly by shuttles. ''NASA is attempting now to recover from 35 years that in many ways were a dead end,'' Dr. Logsdon said. ''That was not NASA's mistake, but the country's, the national leadership's.'' It took two disasters -- the Challenger and then the Columbia -- to shock the White House and Congress into trying to redirect the program, Dr. Logsdon said. Two years ago, the Bush administration announced an ambitious ''vision of space exploration'' plan to phase out the shuttles by 2010, while developing more reliable replacement vehicles based on the latest technology. The stated goal is to have them ready by 2012. Their main purpose is to return people to the Moon and, eventually, to take them to Mars. Dr. Logsdon said he was cautiously optimistic. ''All along, we should have been exploring and continuing the momentum of Apollo,'' he said. Dr. Roland and other critics are skeptical. ''The announcement was a piece of election year rhetoric,'' he said. ''It's not going to happen, not the way it has started. All the big money for the program will have to come after Bush leaves office.'' But advisers close to Dr. Griffin and a former agency official say the NASA administrator believes that the shuttle is a dangerous vehicle and is committed to finding a replacement and a new mission. After the Challenger, they recalled, there was no such new vision. With the anniversaries of past setbacks, Dr. Griffin said, ''It's a tough job, and the losses that we have sustained so far reflect the difficulty of the challenge and our limitations as human beings as we try to invent a new technology.''"
"The explosion that killed three men and injured a fourth at an acetylene gas plant in Perth Amboy last year was caused by a combination of human and technical failures, federal investigators said on Thursday. The blast could have been avoided, said Stephen J. Selk, the lead investigator for the United States Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, with newer equipment, checklists for safety procedures and better training of employees. The explosion, on Jan. 25, 2005, occurred after a check valve in one of the plant's water pipes failed, allowing highly volatile acetylene gas to flow backward and out an open drain valve into a shed. The gas apparently ignited when it came in contact with the shed's propane space heater, according to the board. The explosion, heard miles away, killed three workers -- Enio Perez, 34; Pablo Morillo, 29; and German Gonzalez Vasquez, 46 -- who were shoveling snow. Another worker, Jiovai Pena Gomez, was injured. Another factor, according to the board, was the failure of plant operators to send water into the water pipe when switching between its supplies of city water and the plant's own recycled stores of water. The water pressure would have been sufficient to prevent the gas from backing up, the board said. The check valve was an added precaution. Mr. Selk said that the check valve, designed in the 1930's and bought new about 20 years ago by the plant's owner, Acetylene Supply Company of Woodbridge, was a primary safeguard against explosion. He said that the rubber stopper in the valve tilted, caught on the lip of a pipe, and left space for acetylene to escape. ''We consider it a design that really needs to be replaced,'' he said. The company that produced the valve, Rexarc, of West Alexandria, Ohio, said in a statement that its products ''were consistent with industry standards and properly designed.'' The Chemical Safety Board's conclusion, it said, ''is incorrect and any implication of wrongdoing by Rexarc is unjustified.'' A woman who answered the phone at Acetylene Supply said the company had no comment on the case. Relatives of the victims, however, said in interviews that they agreed with the Chemical Safety Board's recommendations, which included more training for workers and designs that would minimize the risk of acetylene being ignited. ''It angers me,'' said Emilia Perez, 25, Mr. Perez's sister. ''They didn't have any safety measures. They didn't train the workers about the dangers they were working with.'' In July, after its own investigation, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined Acetylene Supply $237,600 for 40 alleged violations of federal safety standards."
"In the final desperate hours of the Sago Mine disaster that left 12 men dead in West Virginia, at least four of the air masks meant to protect the miners from dangerous smoke and fumes did not work, the sole survivor wrote in a letter to victims' families this week. ''The first thing we did was activate our rescuers, as we had been trained,'' wrote the miner, Randal McCloy Jr. ''At least four of the rescuers did not function. There were not enough rescuers to go around.'' The two-page typed letter offers the first detailed account of what happened to the 13 men trapped 260 feet underground, struggling for air as rescue crews tried to reach them. ''As my trapped co-workers lost consciousness one by one, the room grew still and I continued to sit and wait, unable to do much else,'' Mr. McCloy wrote. Mr. McCloy was comatose when he was rescued and spent months in a hospital with extensive brain damage, originally described as remembering nothing about the disaster. His letter, however, is a cogent and moving account of what happened, and it was not immediately clear how he came to compose it or why he chose to send it. Stephen P. Goodwin, the lawyer for the McCloy family, verified that the letter, obtained by The Associated Press, came from Mr. McCloy and that it had been dictated, but would not say who wrote it down for him. ''All I will say is that the letter accurately reflects all of his thoughts and sentiments,'' Mr. Goodwin said. Phil Smith, a spokesman for the United Mine Workers Union of America, said: ''The letter raises some key concerns yet again, as we have done in the past, about these oxygen generation packs.'' Mr. Smith said it was ''absolutely imperative'' that federal mine regulators ''begin an immediate and nationwide inspection of these units.'' In a statement, the mine owner, International Coal Group Inc., refused to comment on the validity of Mr. McCloy's recollection. But the company said the miners' air packs, also known as self-contained self-rescue devices, or S.C.S.R.'s, had been tested by federal investigators after the Jan. 2 explosion that trapped the miners. ''I.C.G. was informed that the S.C.S.R.'s found at the barricade were deployed and showed evidence of use,'' the statement said. ''The federal investigators did not note any defective S.C.S.R.'s and all appeared to be in working order.'' The statement did not indicate whether workers at the mine, which resumed work on March 15, were still depending on the same equipment. Dennis B. O'Dell, administrator of occupational health and safety for the mine workers union, said that a typical oxygen pack had a shelf life of about 10 years. Under federal regulations, miners are supposed to visually inspect oxygen packs to see whether the color-coded indicator shows that they are functioning properly. In the letter, Mr. McCloy said the men were forced to share the few functioning air packs. He said the miners tried to escape but had to retreat because of smoke and fumes. ''We found a sledgehammer, and for a long time, we took turns pounding away,'' Mr. McCloy wrote, describing their frantic efforts to get the attention of rescuers above. Eventually realizing they were unlikely to escape alive, the men recited a ''sinner's prayer,'' and began quietly penning farewell notes to their families, the letter said. While the cause of the explosion remains uncertain, the company has speculated that lightning bolt ignited a natural buildup of methane in the mine. Federal officials are conducting an investigation and are expected to release their findings next month. There have been 26 mining deaths nationwide in only the first four months of the year. Last year at this time, there were 13 nationwide. It was unclear how Mr. McCloy, who was initially unable to speak and now does so with difficulty, could have put together such a detailed chronology of events. Mr. McCloy, 27, who has been nicknamed the ''miracle miner,'' survived exposure to toxic fumes for more than 40 hours. The statement from the coal company said that all of the oxygen packs had been inspected daily by miners and every 90 days by a mining official. Dirk Fillpot, a spokesman with the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, said his agency examined all the air packs recovered from the mine. Initial tests concluded that the packs were functioning properly, Mr. Fillpot said. He said his agency was ''looking at whether the miners received adequate training in the use of their S.C.S.R.'s.'' In 2005, the Sago Mine had only one violation concerning its oxygen equipment, according to federal records. The violation was for failing keep proper records of inspections of the mine's oxygen packs. Representative George Miller of California, the senior Democrat on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, expressed outrage at the revelations in the letter. ''The Bush administration killed a proposal in 2001 that could have required the more frequent replacement of these self-contained self-rescue units,'' Mr. Miller said, ''required more inspections of these units, and provided more adequate training on how to use them.'' He also expressed frustration that a mine safety bill sponsored by Representative Nick J. Rahall II, Democrat of West Virginia, and supported by the West Virginia delegation had yet to receive a vote from the full committee. It would mandate more oxygen packs in mines and the construction of safe chambers where miners could go if the exits were blocked in an emergency. ''Miners are dying at an alarming rate,'' Mr. Rahall said. ''If this letter and the ongoing tragedies are not a motivation enough for Congress to act, then, by golly, I don't know what will be.''"
"Chernobyl still haunts, 20 years after that morning, April 26, 1986, when something went wrong in Reactor No. 4 and it exploded, sending a plume of debris and radioactive particles across the Soviet Union and eventually far beyond. Some have said that Chernobyl -- the human and environmental toll it caused, the obfuscations of the Kremlin it revealed -- hastened the end of the Soviet Union itself. Perhaps. It was certainly never the same afterward. ''What they described in newspapers and magazines -- it was all rubbish,'' said Anatoly Rasskazov, the station photographer who was there that day. ''The ruins that I photographed from the ground and the upper part were retouched so it couldn't be seen that there was a ray coming from there, that everything was glowing,'' he said. ''Just a ruin. So as not to get the public up in arms.'' Twenty years later, the anniversary has occasioned new debate among those who have studied its consequences and those who have wielded the results as evidence of what a world in urgent search of energy should do with nuclear power. A committee of United Nations agencies released a study last fall concluding that the effects were not as dire as first feared. It suggested that only 4,000 would, in the end, die from diseases caused by direct exposure to the radiation. Greenpeace, the environmental group, released its own response last week, saying Chernobyl would kill at least 90,000. The true number may never be known, but the lasting impacts, physical and psychological, are evident in those who came to be known as liquidators. They were the hundreds of thousands of firefighters, pilots, soldiers, scientists and experts sent to contain the damage, to evacuate the citizenry and ultimately to encase the deadly ruin in a concrete sarcophagus whose stability appears precarious. A photographer for The New York Times sought out 27 of them in Moscow, Kiev and Minsk, photographing them as they recounted their experiences at the time and in the turbulent years that followed. What they described sounded very much like war. At least 47 workers and liquidators died almost immediately. Hundreds, perhaps thousands have died since; the records are unclear. The rest endure as veterans, many as invalids, sickly and unappreciated, if not entirely unrecognized by newly independent countries that wish to put the worst of Soviet history behind them. ''Just like the Germans had come, this enemy had arrived,'' said Arkady Rokhlin, an engineer, who was 58 at the time and so old enough to remember that war. ''And we had to defend ourselves.'' And like war, it was disorienting. Fear and heroism mingled with bureaucratic chaos and surrealistic calm. ''In a real war shells explode, bullets fly, bodies fall, blood flows,'' he said. And then he remembered the summer of '86 in the most poisoned place on earth: sun, birds, gardens ''bulging with fruit.'' ''You couldn't possibly have imagined that all this was death.'' STEVEN LEE MYERS"
"As the police began to round up suspects on Tuesday in the triple bombing of this small seaside resort the day before, Dr. Muhammad Hussein was cataloging body parts at the local hospital, and hundreds of Egyptians, some marching in protest, expressed fear that the attack would destroy the tourist industry, and with it their chance to earn a living. This community, a refuge for scuba divers and backpackers, pressed up against the sea by the soaring bare cliffs of the Sinai, is so close-knit that it took almost half the day on Tuesday for the shock to subside enough for anyone to wash the blood from the pedestrian walk, to board up shattered store fronts or even to remove the plates of food left on restaurant tables. There were conflicting reports on the number of fatalities, with some officials saying 18 had died and others saying the toll had reached 24. (In the first confused hours, officials had put the toll at 30.) The bombing was condemned by two leading Islamist groups, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Hamas, the militant Palestinian faction that recently came to power in the West Bank and Gaza. Many of the most critically injured were flown by military planes to Cairo, where some may have died, accounting for the discrepancy in the figures. Dozens of the less seriously injured were taken to a hospital at Sharm el Sheik, a larger town on the southern tip of the Sinai peninsula. ''It is hard to explain how I felt at that moment,'' said Muhammad Yousri, 22, who works in a scuba store very close to the blasts. ''I felt loss, people dying and destruction everywhere, and at that moment I knew what it meant to be safe. It is very difficult when someone loses this sense of safety. Feeling safe is a blessing.'' Some voiced more concrete fears. ''I came here for my sisters -- to help them get married -- and to help me have some kind of future,'' said Maged Eissa, 20, of Mansoura, a city in the Nile delta, whose right leg was badly burned. ''We came here to work, but we now have nothing.'' Egyptian security officials said they had begun picking up dozens of people believed to have connections to, sympathy for or information about those involved in the bombing. Scuba divers continued to troll the turquoise waters of the Gulf of Aqaba looking for body parts. Security men in dark glasses and freshly pressed suits zoomed in and out of town in big S.U.V.'s. This was the third bombing attack on a Sinai town in less than two years, and the third to come at the time of a national holiday. Egyptians were celebrating the end of the Coptic observance of Easter and the national spring holiday of Sham el Nessim, and were planning for Sinai Day on Tuesday, the anniversary of the final withdrawal of Israeli troops from the area in 1982. The celebrations were canceled in many places. While investigators and government officials said it was far too soon to draw any firm conclusions, some said they believed that the profile of this attack was so close to that of the other two, in Taba in 2004 and Sharm el Sheik in 2005, that they would prove to be connected. And that only served to underscore a reality that has already unnerved the authorities: that the Sinai, a place that historically has not bred radical thinking, may have become an incubator for terrorism. ''What happened actually has all the markings of a local group,'' said a high-ranking government official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly. He cited the fact that the suspects obviously knew the area very well. The attack began at 7:15 p.m. on Monday, when the center of this quaint village was packed with Egyptians and foreigners, young and old. Three bombs detonated, maybe 15 seconds apart, witnesses said. The first exploded in the middle of a pedestrian walkway near the Lantern, a restaurant with tables on the beach. The second went off just north of there, over a small wooden bridge, beside the outdoor Al Capone Restaurant. The third hit seconds later, on the south end of the walkway, near the Ghazala Supermarket. In an instant, a stretch no larger than a soccer field was splattered with flesh and blood, and littered with shattered glass. ''Everything was pleasant, and there was nothing shady looming,'' said Galal Rabee, 30, who was working at a shop near the first explosion. ''Then suddenly, it all changed. We found dead people and injured people bleeding.'' Government officials said Tuesday that the bombs were small crude devices and appeared to have been detonated by timers -- though suicide bombers had not absolutely been ruled out. No matter how small the devices, the devastation was considerable. The blasts were set off in the middle of a crowded walkway, which would be like placing three bombs in the Faneuil Hall market in Boston or South Street Seaport in New York on a holiday weekend. Dr. Hussein was working at Dahab Hospital, a small, single-story first aid center about a mile from the beach. The hospital keeps only a few supplies on hand, he said, accustomed as it is to dealing with diving injuries, not wounds more common to a war zone. He said he was eating dinner when he heard the three blasts, and immediately dispatched his three ambulances to pick up the wounded. The little hospital was quickly overwhelmed. ''We were all trying to do anything we could,'' he said. As his staff worked Tuesday to clean the blood off the floors, he read off a grisly inventory of body parts he was storing in a freezer for identification: ''Two heads, right arm, left arm, three right legs, three left legs.'' Officials said a small number of foreigners were killed, perhaps four. The primary target seemed to be Egypt, its tourist industry and its citizens: mainly the men who leave their homes in Cairo and small towns along the Nile, where jobs are scarce, to earn a living along the Gulf of Aqaba. Tourists generate jobs, they tip fairly well and they thus allow thoughts of a future, workers here said. Muhammad Abdel Azim moved here from Cairo and had been saving for nine years to get married. John Samir moved from Sharqiya, and Fayez Tolba moved from Minya. They were working in the Da Vinci Bazaar at a busy corner when the third blast detonated, near the front of the shop. People standing guard inside the shattered remains of the shop said all three men were killed. They said that Mr. Abdel Azim was to be married, finally, next month. But keep walking down the street, called Mashaya, and it is clear who will suffer the reverberations. Ibrahim Ahmed, 19, moved from Cairo a year ago to make a living at the Ghazala Supermarket. Osama Ramsis, 34, moved from Cairo 16 years ago and worked in the Santa Clause Jewellry store. (English spellings are sometimes unconventional.) In Mona Lisa, another jewelry store, was Ahmed Tabakh, 23, who moved from Banha five years ago. In the spice shop was Abdullah Hassan, 21, who moved from Qena a year ago. In the Carpet Center was Ahmed Melihah, 20, who moved from Kafr el Sheik. From all corners they came to Dahab on Tuesday, after the shards of glass had largely been cleared and the police had taken down the yellow tape that had closed off the small bridge in the middle of town. Dozens of Egyptians, men, women and children, marched up and down the main street, condemning terrorism and praising God. ''We want peace, we want to be able to live,'' they chanted as they waved hastily made signs condemning the killing. When 9-year-old Faisal Samir was asked why he was marching, he said, ''We want to eat and drink.''"
"More than six decades after the end of World War II, Germans still routinely come across unexploded bombs beneath farmers' fields or city streets. Lately, there has been a skein of such dangerous discoveries, one with deadly consequences. On Monday morning, a highway worker was killed when his cutting machine struck a World War II bomb beneath a busy autobahn southeast of Frankfurt. The explosion ripped apart the vehicle and damaged several passing cars, wounding four other workers and a motorist. Also on Monday, a weapons-removal squad defused a 500-pound bomb found next to a highway near Hanover, in the north. The police said it was a British aerial bomb, one of tens of thousands dropped on German roads, factories and cities during Allied bombing raids. On Saturday, 1,000 people were evacuated from a town east of Berlin after a bomb was discovered. And last week, 22,000 people were evacuated from a district in Hanover after three bombs were discovered near a house. It was the second largest evacuation for a disposal operation since the end of the war. While the four incidents were not related, they reminded people that even though Germans have spent decades digging out rusty munitions, their landscape remains something of a minefield. ''We'll have enough work to keep us busy for the next 100 to 120 years,'' said Sebastian Semmler, the owner of a small company in Bavaria that specializes in defusing and clearing munitions. Allied warplanes dropped about two million tons of explosives on Germany, ranging from small firebombs to giant high-explosive bombs. There are also buried mortars, land mines and hand grenades, which often turn up during road construction or other major excavations. The explosion on Monday was particularly jarring because the bomb lay under one of Germany's busiest autobahns, which connects Frankfurt and Munich and is a main artery for trucks traveling to and from Eastern Europe. The highway, built in 1956, was closed for several hours. Authorities said they had not yet determined the type of the bomb, which tore a crater in the roadway 6 feet deep and 26 feet across. Pieces of the construction vehicle were blown 500 yards from the site. Normally German authorities defuse bombs with a minimum of fuss. In Hanover, the highway was closed for barely an hour. The last fatalities from a World War II bomb here were in 1994, when three construction workers were killed and 17 injured after a bomb exploded at a building site in Berlin. Even in the countryside, buried bombs pose a danger, Mr. Semmler said, because they can move closer to the surface over decades, as farmers till the land, removing rocks and layers of soil. The biggest problem, Mr. Semmler said, is that many Germans do not want to spend the money searching for bombs before they start digging. Property developers have to bear that cost, and it can quickly rise into the tens of thousands of dollars for a large site in the middle of a city."
"American intelligence agencies have concluded that North Korea's test explosion last week was powered by plutonium that North Korea harvested from its small nuclear reactor, according to officials who have reviewed the results of atmospheric sampling since the blast. The officials, who would not speak for attribution because it was an intelligence matter, were responding to specific questions about what had been learned about the nature of the weapon. As administration and intelligence officials watched for indications that the North might be preparing a second test, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice warned North Korea on Monday that it risked even further isolation if it took such a provocative action. American officials have reported recent activity at the test site, leading some to believe that another test might be carried out soon. The intelligence agencies' finding that the weapon was based on plutonium strongly suggested that the country's second path to a nuclear bomb -- one using uranium -- was not yet ready. The uranium program is based on enrichment equipment and know-how purchased from Pakistan's former nuclear chief. Nuclear experts said that the use of plutonium to make the bomb was important because it suggested that North Korea probably had only one nuclear program mature enough to produce weapons. ''This is good news because we have a reasonably good idea of how much plutonium they have made,'' said Siegfried S. Hecker, the former chief of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and now a visiting professor at Stanford University. Mr. Hecker, who has visited North Korea and is one of the few foreigners to have seen parts of its nuclear infrastructure, said that it was his guess that ''they tried to test a reasonably sophisticated device, and they had trouble imploding it properly.'' The supply of plutonium materials is known from the days when international inspectors kept tabs on the fuel rods in the North's reactor, and intelligence analysts estimate that North Korea has enough material to make 6 to 10 plutonium bombs. Politically, the results of the test may revive last week's finger-pointing about who is more responsible for the Korean test: Bill Clinton or President Bush. As president, Mr. Clinton negotiated a deal that froze the production and weaponization of North Korea's plutonium, but intelligence agencies later determined that North Korea began its secret uranium program under his watch. The plutonium that North Korea exploded was produced, according to intelligence estimates, either during the administration of the first President Bush or after 2003, when the North Koreans threw out international inspectors and began reprocessing spent nuclear fuel the inspectors had kept under seal. Unlike the Clinton administration in 1994, the current Bush administration chose not to threaten to destroy North Korea's fuel and nuclear reprocessing facilities if they tried to make weapons. That threat in 1994 -- which was ultimately resolved with an agreement to freeze the weapons program -- was made by William J. Perry, who was the defense secretary then. In an interview on Monday, Mr. Perry said: ''There was a brief window to catch this plutonium before it was made into bomb fuel. It's gone. It's out of the barn now.'' After a week of some lingering doubt about whether the test had indeed been a nuclear detonation, the office of John D. Negroponte, director of national intelligence, confirmed that much in a statement issued Monday. ''Analysis of air samples collected on Oct. 11, 2006, detected radioactive debris which confirms that North Korea conducted an underground nuclear explosion in the vicinity of Punggye on Oct. 9, 2006,'' said the statement, putting on the record a conclusion that officials first disclosed Friday, the night before the United Nations Security Council voted on sanctions. ''The explosion yield was less than a kiloton,'' the statement added. It gave no further details, and the officials who described the early findings did not disclose more beyond the conclusion that plutonium, not uranium, was the device's core. The determination that the blast was nuclear was announced a day before Secretary Rice was to depart for a trip to Japan, South Korea, China and Russia. She will go to the capitals of the nations that have been engaged in the six-party talks over North Korea's nuclear program except, of course, North Korea. The unanimous resolution adopted by the Security Council last week imposing sanctions on military material and luxury goods was proof of ''a strong and firm hand and strong and firm response,'' Ms. Rice said Monday during a State Department news conference. She said the international community wanted ''to leave open a door for North Korea to take a different course if it wishes to do so.'' Pressed to respond to analysts' assessment that desires by China and South Korea for continued economic and business exchanges with North Korea might trump demands for a stiff sanctions and inspections regime, Ms. Rice said her goal was to work out the details of putting the Council resolution into effect. The Associated Press reported Monday from Dandong, China, that customs officials were examining trucks at the North Korean border as China complied with the United Nations sanctions. However, China's ambassador to the United Nations, Wang Guangya, indicated that his nation would not conduct similar searches at sea. Mr. Wang made clear that China would not halt ships and board them to search for ballistic missiles or for bomb-making equipment or material that can be used to manufacture nuclear, chemical and biological arms. ''This is a resolution we have to implement,'' he told reporters at the United Nations. ''The question was raised whether China will do inspections. Inspections yes, but inspection is different than interdiction and interception. I think different countries will do it different ways.'' During the news conference on Monday, Ms. Rice said she was ''not concerned that the Chinese are going to turn their backs on their obligations. I don't think they would have voted for a resolution if they did not intend to carry through on it.''"
"The North Korean test appears to have been a nuclear detonation but was fairly small by traditional standards, and possibly a failure or a partial success, federal and private analysts said yesterday. Throughout history, the first detonations of aspiring nuclear powers have tended to pack the destructive power of 10,000 to 60,000 tons -- 10 to 60 kilotons -- of conventional high explosives. But the strength of the North Korean test appears to have been a small fraction of that: around a kiloton or less, according to scientists monitoring the global arrays of seismometers that detect faint trembles in the earth from distant blasts. ''It's pretty remarkable that such a small explosion was promptly apparent on seismometers all over the world,'' said Paul Richards, a seismologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y. ''The detection of this was really good. You can't hide these kinds of things, even very small tests.'' A senior Bush administration official said he had learned through Asian contacts that the North Koreans had expected the detonation to have a force of about four kilotons. Because classified information was involved and there was lingering uncertainty, he would not let his name be used. Philip E. Coyle III, a former director of weapons testing at the Pentagon and former director of nuclear testing for the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a weapons design center in California, said the small size of the test signaled the possibility of what might be described as a partial success or a partial failure. ''As first tests go, this is smaller and less successful than those of the other nuclear powers,'' he said. Perhaps the North Koreans wanted to keep it small, he added. ''But if it turns out to be a kiloton or less,'' Dr. Coyle said, ''that would suggest that they hoped for more than that and didn't get it.'' The United States Geological Survey said it had detected a tremor on the Korean Peninsula of 4.2 magnitude, which translates into an explosive force of roughly 1,000 tons. The agency listed 20 seismic stations as having initially picked up the blast's shockwave, including nearby ones in China, Japan and South Korea as well as distant ones in Ukraine, Australia, Nevada and Wyoming. The Russian defense minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, told the Itar-Tass news agency that the Russian government believed the strength of the blast to have been 5 to 15 kilotons. The basis for his claim was not immediately clear. In Washington, intelligence officials said they were still in the early stages of evaluating the North Korean blast. But one said analysts had estimated its force at less than a kiloton. ''We have assessed that the explosion in North Korea was a sub-kiloton explosion,'' said the intelligence official, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing classified information. It will probably take several days to determine with confidence if the explosion was in fact nuclear, the official said. He added that so far, sensors had not detected radiation leaking from the blast site. But federal and private experts said it seemed unlikely that the North Koreans had faked an underground nuclear blast with a large pile of conventional high explosives. First, they said, the political risks involved would seem disproportionate. More important, federal and private analysts said, the United States has long had spy satellites observing the North Korean site and appears to have found no signs of chemical explosives being unloaded. ''It's difficult to fake it when you know people are looking down on you,'' said Dr. Richards of Columbia. ''The execution of a chemical explosion would be hard to hide.'' Dr. Coyle, the former director of nuclear testing at Livermore, said small tests were more likely to leak radioactivity than large ones, because the intense heat and gigantic shock waves of bigger blasts tended to melt and pulverize nearby rock into impregnable barriers. Experts said the United States, Japan and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization had equipment that could sniff the air and water around North Korea for signs of radioactivity. The South Koreans estimated the seismic magnitude of the blast at roughly 3.6. William Leith, the coordinator of seismic monitoring at the United States Geological Survey, said the South Korean method was different from and not comparable with the American technique. He added that the American estimate of 4.2 was unlikely to change. In Vienna, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization estimated the blast's magnitude at 4.0, which is within the error margin of the American estimate. An American intelligence official said the blast had shaken a North Korean site that the nation's spy agencies had long monitored -- the flank of a mountain not far from the northeastern coast. The small size of the explosion, he said, ''tells you they have a lot of work to do in terms of weaponizing what they've got.'' He added, ''If the lower-yield estimates are valid, then it's not a militarized system, but also not something a terrorist would reject.'' THE NORTH KOREAN CHALLENGE"
"With the United Nations preparing to vote on whether to impose harsh sanctions on North Korea, American intelligence officials said Friday evening that they had found new evidence that the country detonated a nuclear bomb deep inside a mountain in its desolate northern territory. An analysis of air samples taken in the region on Wednesday found radioactive material that is ''consistent with a North Korean nuclear test,'' according to a document sent to lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Friday by the office of John D. Negroponte, the director of national intelligence. But a senior intelligence official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the results were still preliminary and that final analysis of the data would not be completed for several days. The document was provided to The New York Times on Friday evening. One day after the blast, the Pentagon dispatched Air Force planes with special radiation detectors into international airspace near North Korea. The official did not say whether the planes had collected the radioactive sample. One question that remains is whether the explosion that North Korean leaders announced with great fanfare might actually have been a failure or merely a partial success. Intelligence officials and independent scientists have said that the detonation was a ''sub-kiloton'' blast -- an explosion far smaller than typical nuclear tests by novice bomb designers. One widely held theory is that the nuclear blast was less powerful than the North Koreans had hoped it would be. This week, American officials said the North Koreans had notified the Chinese government that the nuclear test would be in the range of four kilotons. ''Based in very incomplete information, it smells to me like a fizzle,'' said Sidney Drell, a theoretical physicist and arms control expert at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Given the comparatively small size of the blast, American officials said, it is possible that only a small amount of radioactive material leaked from the subterranean test site. Because the test was conducted by one of the world's most closed societies, the Pentagon and intelligence agencies have had to construct complicated computer models to try to prove North Korean claims of a nuclear test. They used the models to calculate the times when the Air Force's WC-135 ''Constant Phoenix'' aircraft would have the best chance to collect samples of radiation from the explosion. Military officials said this week that the ability to detect any radiation would depend partly on the uncertainties of nature because the prevailing winds would have to blow east toward the military aircraft patrols. Professor Drell also said any radiation leakage would depend on the geology of the test site. The explosion could have blasted new holes in rock formations that would allow radioactive material to seep into the air. But the blast could also have sealed off subterranean passages and reduced the chances for leaking. ''We're in the process now of going through, looking through all the data and all the facts to try to come up with the best possible explanation for what, exactly, happened there,'' said Sean McCormack, a State Department spokesman. ''We don't know yet.''"
"A gas pipeline explosion that has killed at least seven people in East Java was a consequence of the mud eruptions that began several months ago, government officials and drilling experts said Thursday. The heavy outflows of mud and water caused the earth level to drop, and a dike that had been built to contain the mud collapsed, officials said, creating pressure that ruptured the pipeline. ''The land subsided two meters,'' the minister for energy and mineral resources, Purnomo Yusgiantoro, said at a news conference in Surabaya after inspecting the site of the blast, 23 miles to the south. The explosion, which occurred Wednesday evening, sent flames shooting into the sky. Unofficial accounts have put the death toll at 10, most of them police officers and soldiers. At least 15 people were injured and several are still missing, officials said Thursday. Such an accident had been feared since the mud eruptions began nearly six months ago, after a company drilling for natural gas, Lapindo Brantas, failed to properly line the sides of its well, according to government officials."
"A suicide car bomber struck a NATO military convoy in the southern province of Kandahar on Wednesday, wounding three NATO soldiers and killing himself. In another development, the Afghan police announced that they had arrested a suspect in the killing of Safia Amajan, the director of women's affairs for Kandahar. She was shot as she left for work in Kandahar on Sept. 25. The suicide bomber drove his explosives-laden vehicle into the NATO convoy in Shorabak, an area just outside Kandahar, on Wednesday afternoon, said Maj. Luke Knittig, a spokesman for the NATO force in Kabul. He said that three soldiers were wounded, ''but suffered nonlife-threatening injuries and they were successfully medically evacuated.'' He did not give the nationality of the soldiers, but the soldiers most frequently on patrol in Kandahar Province are Canadians. On Tuesday, three American soldiers were killed after their convoy hit a roadside bomb in the northeastern province of Nuristan. The Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman, Zemarai Bashary, announced Wednesday that the Kandahar police had arrested a former member of Hezb-e-Islami, the mujahedeen party led by the renegade commander Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, and that the man they arrested had confessed that he had killed Mrs. Amajan, a 65-year-old former teacher and high school principal. She had been in charge of the Kandahar department of the Ministry of Women's Affairs for the last five years. Mr. Bashary said the government had concluded that the assassination was a contract killing. ''The killer, Abdul Aziz, is a resident of Kandahar who was promised $4,000 for the killing of Mrs. Amajan, but he says he has not received the money yet,'' the spokesman said. An investigation into the killing is continuing, he said."
"Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki said Sunday that Iraq's politicians were largely responsible for the surge in violence that engulfed the country over the past week, a departure from his previous assertions blaming militants for inciting the mayhem. ''These actions are at most the reflection of political backgrounds and wills and sometimes the reflection of dogmatic, perverted backgrounds and wills,'' Mr. Maliki said. ''The crisis is political, and the ones who can stop the cycle of aggravation and bloodletting of innocents are the politicians.'' He said politicians must work harder to stop the violence. Mr. Maliki spoke at a news conference just a few days before he was to meet with President Bush to discuss the deteriorating security situation in Iraq. The remarks were an acknowledgment of the political nature of the war here and placed responsibility on political leaders for achieving peace. The war is being driven by leaders of Sunni and Shiite militias vying for dominance and has spiraled into a pattern of revenge killings and rival sects driving each other out of neighborhoods. Mr. Maliki spoke after a meeting of an advisory security council of Iraq's top politicians, including himself, the president and the speaker of Parliament. The council has met in recent days in an attempt to quell the tensions after the killings of more than 200 people by bombings in a Shiite district of Baghdad on Thursday, the deadliest single attack since the American invasion. The next day, vengeful Shiite militiamen attacked Sunni mosques in Baghdad and in the nearby city of Baquba. Mr. Maliki said the members of the security council would work to bring together clashing political groups in Iraq. He did not identify the specific groups. In a show of unity, Mr. Maliki, a Shiite, appeared at the news conference alongside President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, and Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi, a conservative Sunni Arab. Mr. Maliki is scheduled to meet with President Bush in Amman, Jordan, on Wednesday and Thursday. The two are expected to talk about the widening sectarian war in Iraq and to try to reach agreement on ways to stop it. Tension has been rising between their governments, as officials from each have debated pursuing different policies in the face of continuing violence. In the afternoon, Mr. Maliki attended a funeral in Sadr City, the district bombed Thursday and a base of support for Moktada al-Sadr, the anti-American Shiite cleric who lends political support to Mr. Maliki. The funeral was for four brothers killed in the bombings, a Sadr official said. Mr. Sadr's militia, the Mahdi Army, is believed responsible for many of the directed killings here. Despite a curfew in Baghdad in effect since the Thursday bombings, deadly violence continued. Mortar rounds landed near a Shiite mosque downtown, killing two and wounding at least two others, an Interior Ministry official said. An American military spokesman said indirect fire -- meaning mortar shells or rockets -- landed near an American base, but he gave no report of casualties. The projectiles came from an area near Sadr City, the military said. Violence erupted in other parts of the country. A suicide car bomb exploded at a police checkpoint in the town of Iskandariya, killing at least eight people and wounding at least 26 others, a police official said. In Diyala Province, east of Baghdad, the police found at least eight bodies, while gunmen kidnapped at least 25 people from Hadaf village. On a highway south of Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown, gunmen abducted eight policemen from a checkpoint. The American military announced Sunday that a patrol found 11 bodies on Wednesday about 18 miles west of Haqlaniya, in Anbar Province. There were 10 men and one child or teenager, and all had apparently died from gunfire, the military said. A burned-out van was found nearby. An American soldier was killed and two were wounded by a roadside bomb explosion in Diyala Province on Saturday, the military said. Two marines died in separate attacks in Anbar Province on Saturday. The military also said a detainee died Saturday at Camp Bucca, an American-run detention center in southern Iraq, from what appeared to be natural causes. In Basra, gunmen killed at least three people on Sunday, police officials said, and a roadside bomb south of the city killed one person."
"AS John Frazier recalls it, his marching orders from the producer Jerry Bruckheimer and the director Tony Scott in connection with their forthcoming film, ''D√©j_ Vu,'' were clear, if not exactly simple. He was supposed to shock the audience with ''a hyper-realistic act to motivate them to sit through an unrealistic exercise that would undo the horror of the realism.'' In other words, Mr. Frazier, a 35-year veteran of the pyrotechnic and special effects business -- in film industry jargon, a ''powder guy'' -- was supposed to blow something up. Big time. Audiences can judge his handiwork when ''D√©j_ Vu'' opens on Nov. 22, or they can glimpse it in a trailer now playing on the Web and in theaters. For a scene that culminates the film's five-minute opening title sequence, Mr. Frazier, who shared a 2005 Academy Award for best visual effects on ''Spider-Man 2'' and previously worked with Mr. Bruckheimer rigging movie explosions on ''Armageddon'' and ''Pearl Harbor,'' engineered the seeming destruction of a 225-foot-long passenger ferry, the Alvin T. Stumpf, by a terrorist bomb. The explosion triggers a plot in which a federal investigator, played by Denzel Washington, contemplates traveling through time to undo the damage. It also provides an image of disaster that is especially chilling because it occurs in post-Katrina New Orleans. Along the way it underscores one of the many reasons big-studio films continue to make an impression: they spare no expense when it comes to the work of effects masters like Mr. Frazier. ''I saw these incredible flames, and I just burst into tears,'' said Bill Marsilii, one of the film's writers, who was standing 300 yards away when the explosion took place last April. ''My first thought was 'My God, what have I done?' '' As an aspiring screenwriter in September 2001, Mr. Marsilii stood on the corner of Sixth Avenue and Fourth Street, near his Greenwich Village apartment, and watched in horror as the World Trade Center towers fell. Having struggled to conceptualize ''D√©j_ Vu'' since 1997, he stopped writing for a year after the 2001 terrorist attacks, he said. Eventually he returned to the story with another writer, Terry Rossio. But it took Mr. Frazier's craft to make it, in movie terms, real. ''D√©j_ Vu'' begins with a scene of hundreds of uniformed Navy sailors and their young families bounding onto the Alvin T. Stumpf -- an actual working ferry that typically runs between the Canal Street and Algiers ferry landings in New Orleans -- during Mardi Gras. Three minutes into the film, the car radio of an unoccupied Ford Bronco suddenly blares in the automobile parking deck of the ferry. After images of cherubic youngsters on the decks above, the film cuts to the back of the Bronco and a bomb rigging of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, fuel oil and blasting caps (similar to the rigging used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing). Seconds after the last main title card is shown, the truck bomb explodes and hurls two-ton cars and a mass of burning sailors off the ferry decks. The resulting 300-foot-high fireball is a red and black phantasm of seemingly deadly flame that resembles a nuclear mushroom cloud. Audiences at recent showings of ''D√©j_ Vu'' recoiled reflexively, despite the ferry explosion's prominence in the preview trailers and commercials that are currently running in theaters, on television and on the Web (movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/trailer.html?v--id=343370). ''The degree of the explosion is what shocks the audience,'' Mr. Scott, the director, said in a recent interview. ''It doesn't matter if people are told it's going to happen. They're just not prepared for something as extreme as this.'' Mr. Bruckheimer, the producer, added that the effect was powerful because it wasn't made with miniature models, or with a software program. ''The explosion is all real,'' he said, ''and an audience absorbs this for the rest of the film because they know it's not faked in a computer.'' Even so, what the tremendous detonation represented, ultimately, was an illusion of danger. ''Coordinating the camera helicopters that shoot an explosion is actually more dangerous than detonating the explosion -- if the powder is being rigged correctly,'' Mr. Bruckheimer added. Mr. Frazier said of the blast: ''It was all a trick. The ferry you see in the film was put back in service four days after we filmed the explosion, and in my whole career I've never done more unintended damage than blowing out two windows.'' In the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the mixture of fertilizer and fuel oil was detonated all at once, at an extremely high speed, by dynamite. In ''D√©j_ Vu,'' the ferry explosion is actually a series of individual detonations placed throughout the length of the boat. And, although he is known as a ''powder guy,'' Mr. Frazier's fuel of choice for the special effect was gasoline. ''Each gasoline bomb we rigged would burn off in three seconds if it went off by itself,'' he explained. ''But when you set off 50 gasoline bombs like we did within five seconds, there's a cumulative heat effect that feeds on itself, and which just sucks this huge fireball into the hot air that keeps rising above the ferry. We added a little diesel fuel to give the fireball a red color, and a lot of black dirt, which gives the fireball its dark entrails.'' After the interior and exterior of the ferry were painstakingly covered with fire retardant, Mr. Frazier used 350 separate bombs that were grouped into 50 explosive ''events.'' Extending the time that the fireball burns was in large part the job of Chris Lebenzon, an editor and a veteran of Bruckheimer and Scott shoots. Mr. Lebenzon was working from film shot through 15 cameras strategically placed by another Bruckheimer-Scott veteran, the cinematographer Paul Cameron. At the end of the ''D√©j_ Vu'' ferry explosion, 1,000 gallons of the gasoline-diesel fuel mixture burned long enough for the movie pros to simulate what only looks to be a catastrophe. Mr. Frazier and his special effects crew were inside the ferry with fire hoses and extinguishers as the special effects were detonated. New Orleans firefighters stood by but remained out of action. ''The code of a powder guy is that we put out our own fires,'' Mr. Frazier said. (Another of Mr. Frazier's credos is: Don't hire military veterans trained in explosives -- ''All they want to do is rip and tear,'' he said -- or anyone who claims he loved blowing things up as a child. ''They're a little too spooky.'') Ultimately audiences will have to process the explosion on their own terms. Stuart Fischoff, a retired professor of media psychology at California State University, Los Angeles, said he expects some viewers to stay away because of the graphic depiction of terrorist destruction and others to seek it out for much the same reason. He added that though he was disturbed by the ''AT&T-commercial-like look that Tony Scott opens the film with before killing kids and their dolls,'' the speed with which Mr. Scott establishes the ''emotional caring, anger and desire for revenge allows the audience to immediately hope for the undoing of the terrorist act.'' Mr. Marsilii, the screenwriter, agreed. ''One of the unique virtues of a time-travel story like 'D√©j_ Vu' is that it allows you to have your disaster and stop it too,'' he said. But he acknowledged that five years after he witnessed the events of Sept. 11, he was treading on dangerous ground by giving today's attention-deficit film audiences such a bang in the first few minutes. ''If anyone sees that explosion and applauds,'' he said, ''then we've totally failed as filmmakers.'' FILM"
"A bomb exploded in an armored car among those belonging to the speaker of Parliament, wounding the American security guard who was driving it out of a parking area in the government Green Zone and disrupting a meeting of lawmakers nearby, a parliamentary aide said. Though the speaker, Mahmoud al-Mashhadani, was not in the vehicle and was unscathed, the assassination attempt was one of the most serious breaches of security yet within the Green Zone, the heavily fortified government district on the west bank of the Tigris River. The bomb, which exploded in midafternoon, was planted inside an armored car that resembled the one the speaker uses and was usually used as a decoy car in his convoy, said the parliamentary aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly about the attack. Only part of the bomb exploded, the aide said. A police official said investigators believe that the bomb was planted inside the Green Zone and detonated by cellphone. Mr. Mashhadani, a hard-line Sunni Arab nationalist reviled by many Shiites, was attending a Parliament meeting inside the Green Zone convention center at the time of the explosion. He and other legislators were forced to stay inside for hours afterward while the American military secured the area. In the summer, senior Shiite and Kurdish leaders, backed by some American officials, called for his ouster because of inflammatory comments he had made about various groups in Iraq and about the American presence. The most serious breach of security inside the Green Zone occurred in October 2004, when insurgents set off two bombs in crowded areas that killed at least five people, including three Americans. Individuals have also been attacked there: at least one foreign jogger was reportedly stabbed, and another intentionally hit by a vehicle. While Parliament members stewed inside the convention center, a senior Kurdish legislator said in a telephone interview that the president, Jalal Talabani, had accepted an invitation from the president of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, to meet in Damascus. Such a meeting would be the highest-level diplomatic discussion between the two countries in decades, and would seal a reconciliation that took place this week with the visit of the Syrian foreign minister here. No date has been set for Mr. Talabani's visit, said the legislator, Mahmoud Othman, a member of the Kurdistan Alliance. The invitation was delivered to Mr. Talabani by the Syrian foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, who came to Iraq to re-establish diplomatic ties that were severed in 1982, after Syria sided with Iran in the Iran-Iraq war. Mr. Talabani is scheduled to visit Iran this weekend, months after Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki made his first trip there. Mr. Othman said there were rumors that the Iranian government had also invited Mr. Assad to the meeting, but there was no definite sign that any senior Syrian officials would attend. Meanwhile, the White House announced that President Bush would meet with Mr. Maliki in Jordan next week to discuss security in Iraq. Early Tuesday, American and Iraqi forces raided the Shiite district of Sadr City in eastern Baghdad and detained a man the American military identified as the leader of a kidnapping ring in connection with the abduction last month of an American soldier, Specialist Ahmed al-Taie. Soldiers detained six other Iraqis. The raid sparked a battle that involved fire from American aircraft. A Shiite official in the district, Sheik Abdul Zahra al-Suaidi, said in a telephone interview that five civilians had been killed in the fighting, including a woman and a child, and 15 others were wounded. A spokeswoman for the American military, Lt. Col. Josslyn Aberle, said in an e-mail message that ''there may have been civilian casualties.'' Across Baghdad, at least 29 bodies were discovered Tuesday, an Interior Ministry official said. In Diyala Province, at least 13 people were killed in scattered violence. THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ"
"The moans of the lone survivor of the Sago Mine disaster led to the mistaken announcement that all the miners had survived their underground ordeal, a member of the rescue team testified on Wednesday. The rescuer, Bill Tucker, took responsibility for uttering the words that led to the false hopes of family members -- and to incorrect headlines around the world. Testifying on the second day of hearings into the explosion that claimed 12 lives in the West Virginia mine, Mr. Tucker said that when he heard the moans of Randal McCloy Jr., he turned and yelled to his fellow rescuers. ''I don't recall the exact words I used,'' he said. ''I think I may have said, 'They're alive!' '' ''That may have been the start of the miscommunication,'' said Mr. Tucker, assistant inspector for the West Virginia Office of Miners' Health Safety and Training. When Mr. Tucker checked the vital signs of the 11 other miners in the area, he found they were all dead. Another miner was killed elsewhere, apparently in the initial explosion. Wednesday was the first time the public learned the source of the miscommunication, which was quickly passed on to relatives of the miners gathered at the Sago Baptist Church. Two hours later, family members learned the truth. ''For myself and all the mine rescue workers, we apologize for any of the problems or heartaches caused,'' said another rescuer, Ronald Hixson. ''That was not meant to be.'' During the hearing, consultants for the International Coal Group, the owner of the mine, explained their theory that a powerful lightning strike caused the explosion in the mine, a theory that many at the hearing challenged. The lightning bolt blew apart a tree near the mine at 6:26 a.m. on Jan. 2, said Dr. Thomas Novak, professor of mining and engineering at Virginia Tech. From there, he said, the charge jumped 300 feet to the power line that provided electricity to the mine. It then traveled down the line, Dr. Novak said, through the mine's conveyor belt system, up chains connecting the system to the roof, through several feet of solid rock, and into the wire mesh that supports the roof in a sealed-off section of the mine, where it ignited the explosion. The charge would have to have traveled four miles, he said. ''You have a continuous metallic conductor all the way back to the sealed area of the mine.'' Dr. Novak said. Relatives of the dead and members of the investigating panel expressed skepticism about the theory. ''Can you cite one single event in the 100-year history of coal mining in the United States and Canada when a lightning strike sparked an explosion inside a coal mine?'' said Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of America. ''No, I can't,'' Dr. Novak replied. Later, Pam Campbell, sister-in-law of one of the dead miners, Marty Bennett, challenged Dr. Novak directly. ''You don't even know if this theory is even possible,'' she said. Panel leaders and relatives of the miners wondered whether a collapsing roof in the mine's sealed-off section might have caused an electrical spark, a situation that they feel is a more likely cause of the explosion. That section of the mine has a long history of roof collapses, which is why it was closed, said Sam Kitts, senior vice president of operations for International Coal. ''I don't understand how you ruled out a roof fall as a possible cause of ignition,'' said a panel member, Bill Hamilton, a state legislator. The state and federal mining agencies responsible for mine safety were to present the initial findings of their investigations Wednesday, but testimony ran over and their presentations were postponed until Thursday. Family members also challenged state and federal regulators and the mine's owners to explain possible safety problems at the mine. They asked about the age and availability of oxygen canisters carried by the miners to provide an hour's worth of air in the event of emergencies. Mr. McCloy, in a letter last week to the miners' families, said four of the canisters had failed, forcing the miners to share the breathing devices. They also asked about the walls built to seal off older sections of the mine. The blast obliterated the walls, said Steve Sawyer, a structural engineer hired by International Coal. Ben Hatfield, chief executive of International Coal, said: ''The walls were built according to federal rules. Those rules have clearly failed us.''"
"As many as 200 people were burned to death and dozens of others injured Friday morning when a gasoline pipeline exploded in a Nigerian seaside village some 30 miles east of the country's commercial capital, Lagos. The explosion occurred at Inagbe, a fishing community, and scorched everything within 20 yards after a rupture in the pipeline, which attracted villagers to the scene to collect gasoline that was gushing out. Witnesses said the site was strewn with charred bodies and burned cans and buckets that the victims had been using to scoop up the gasoline, according to television reports and local journalists. ''So far, over 100 burnt bodies have been seen, while efforts are on to recover more of the bodies,'' said a police statement issued in Abuja. A Lagos police chief, Emmanuel Adebayo, said at the scene of the blast that there could be as many as 200 people dead, local reporters said by telephone. A police statement said that a ''preliminary investigation report indicates that the fire incident was as a result of pipeline vandalization, as over 70 jerrycans, long hoses, pliers, nut removers, chisels -- all implements of vandalization -- were seen and recovered from the scene.'' The police said they had found ''two burnt outboard engines by the seaside, an indication that some vandals might have come in by boats and canoes.'' The Red Cross and some policemen arrived, and The Associated Press reported that about 100 bodies had been buried together near the site. ''We just decided to give them a mass burial, because no one can recognize them,'' The A.P. quoted Tola Kasali, the Lagos State health commissioner, as saying. ''Even their family members can't identify them. We're concerned that if we don't do that, we'll create a health emergency in Lagos, since it happened by the shore and the water will just flow back into the city.'' Biodun Oladunjoye, spokesman of Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency, said, ''We are used to explosions of this nature in Nigeria.'' ''We know what usually happens when such explosions occur,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''There isn't any search and rescue to be done. What we usually would do is just to ensure that injured people are taken to hospitals as quickly as possible and the dead are, well, taken to the nearest mortuary.'' Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, is the world's seventh-largest exporter of petroleum and the fifth-largest supplier to the United States. More than 90 percent of Nigeria's national income comes from oil earnings. ''Bunkering,'' a local term for oil or gasoline theft, is common in the swampy Niger Delta, where the thieves use barges and tankers to transport petroleum products to sell. More than 60 people died in a similar inferno last year in Ilado, a short distance from the site of Friday's explosion. The pipeline at Inagbe belonged to the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. The corporation pumps refined petroleum products across long distances using a network of pipelines, many of which pass through villages or farms and often are barely buried beneath the surface. The pipes are usually easy targets for thieves, many of whom are impoverished. ''We are calling on Nigerians to respect our pipelines' right of way,'' Livi Ajuonoma, a spokesman for the company, said in a telephone interview in Abuja, adding that ''the vandalized pipeline has already been repaired and will therefore not affect domestic supply'' of gasoline. He said the blast had occurred while the company was pumping gasoline from its Atlas Cove depot in the outskirts of Lagos. Oil pipeline explosions are not new to Nigeria. At least 1,000 people died in a similar explosion in the town of Jesse in the country's southeast in 1998."
"The owner of the Sago Mine and government regulators did not do enough to correct unsafe conditions and did not begin rescue efforts quickly enough, relatives of the miners testified Thursday in the final day of hearings on the mine collapse that killed 12 men. Relatives said the hearings yielded little new information about the cause of the explosion that caused the collapse but expressed gratitude for a chance to question company and government officials. Inspectors with the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration said the explosion occurred in a sealed-off section of the mine where there was a buildup of methane gas. A spark as small as ''a person walking across carpet on a dry day'' would have been enough to ignite the gas, said Richard Gates, accident investigation leader for the agency. The walls built to seal off that section of the mine are supposed to withstand such an explosion, but they had not been constructed in accordance with federal guidelines, said John Urosek, a mine-ventilation expert with the agency. ''You are aware that the seals failed these men, correct?'' said Russell Bennett, whose father, Marty Bennett, died in the mine. ''They did,'' Mr. Urosek replied, ''and they failed catastrophically.'' Many in the audience said federal regulations were not strong enough to prevent similar disasters. ''Nobody's talking about the real issue, which is that even if the rules are followed, these walls can fail,'' said Joe Main, who recently retired after 22 years as director of worker safety for the United Mine Workers of America. ''The rules need to be much tougher.'' In talking about the rescue efforts, panel members asked why no one was listening for communications from the trapped men. Coal miners are trained to bang metal roof bolts repeatedly, and those vibrations can be sensed by seismographs set up by rescuers at the mine entrance. ''The night of this tragedy, we asked whether anyone was listening to hear the miners pounding,'' said Bill Hamilton, a Republican in the West Virginia House. ''We were told yes, they were. But today we learned that wasn't true.'' The seismographs were never deployed, Mr. Urosek said, because the agency's system was designed in the 1970's and takes at least 12 hours to set up at the site. Mr. Bennett criticized the mine safety agency for its decision not to allow rescuers to enter the mine until 11 hours after the explosion. ''You guys are investigating International Coal Group,'' Mr. Bennett said to Mr. Gates, referring to the owner of the mine. ''Who's investigating M.S.H.A. and the state?'' Federal regulators responded that they could not answer many questions because their investigation was incomplete. But by the end of the day, it was clear they had grown tired of defending actions they said were taken by International Coal. ''I'll tell you this. M.S.H.A. doesn't own Sago Coal Company,'' said Ray McKinney, the agency's administrator of mine safety. ''M.S.H.A. doesn't contract mine rescue teams for Sago Coal Company. And M.S.H.A. is not responsible if Sago Coal Company doesn't train their people to know what to do in an emergency.'' On Wednesday, consultants hired by International Coal presented a theory of how electricity from a powerful lightning bolt might have traveled four miles into the sealed-off area to ignite the explosion. State and federal inspectors said they were still investigating that theory. But regulators have not ruled out the possibility that a falling section of roof behind the seals could have provided the spark."
"President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan ordered his security forces to investigate the American aerial bombardment of a village that killed at least 16 civilians, officials said Tuesday. As the numbers of casualties from the Sunday night operation continued to rise, officials in Mr. Karzai's administration told news agencies that the president would also ask for an explanation from the American commander of coalition forces in Afghanistan, Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry. Accounts of the attack filtering in from the village of Tolokan, which is just 20 miles west of Kandahar but is sealed off by Afghan and foreign troops, suggested that at least 20 villagers, and possibly more, were killed. Wounded villagers treated in the Kandahar city hospital said Monday that they knew of 16 civilians killed and 15 wounded. Many Taliban fighters were also killed in the bombardment, they said. But Abdul Qadar Noorzai, head of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission in Kandahar, said villagers coming to see him told him that 20 to 25 civilians had been killed and 30 to 35 wounded. Some of the wounded were taken to the Kandahar hospital and some to Pakistan, he said. The district chief of Panjwai District also confirmed that 20 civilians had been killed, he said. Coalition forces said they had carried out a successful operation against Taliban fighters in the area on Sunday night and were looking into reports of civilian casualties. In further violence, four Afghan employees of a medical charity were killed in a bomb explosion on Tuesday on a road in central Afghanistan. They were driving through Wardak Province, south of Kabul, when the mine exploded, said Hafizullah Salaam, an aide to the governor of the province. ''It killed all four workers, including a woman health worker, and destroyed the vehicle,'' he said. THE REACH OF WAR: AIRSTRIKE"
"The Abu Odeh family was finishing Saturday lunch when there was a screaming across the sky. ''Suddenly there was a huge explosion,'' said Intisar Abu Odeh, the family matriarch. ''The dishes flew and the television jumped in the air.'' Her husband, Muhammad, 54, said with some awe: ''Everything was upside down. And then I saw my son rushing out of the house, bleeding everywhere, so I took him to the hospital.'' When he got there, he heard that Intisar was at another hospital suffering from shock. With her was his grandson, also named Muhammad, 5, who had been wounded under the chin. ''I didn't know where to go, where to be,'' Mr. Abu Odeh said. ''With my son, or my wife and grandson?'' An Israeli artillery shell had slammed into the Abu Odeh house, which sits on the edge of Beit Hanun, in northern Gaza, overlooking an extraordinary vista of empty fields that once were orchards. The shelling of the area, which began Friday night and lasted until Saturday night, was ordered, the Israeli Army said, in response to four Qassam rockets that had been fired from the Beit Hanun area on Friday night. The army, said a spokesman, Capt. Jacob Dallal, did not aim at a civilian house and regretted any casualties. But the army has been returning fire toward the spots where rockets have been launched for a month now, he said. ''In general, the heavy-handed response has proven itself,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''The number and accuracy of the Qassams are down, and if the Qassams stop, the shelling will too.'' The army had just dropped leaflets in the area promising ''quiet for quiet,'' apparently in an effort to enlist the residents' support to put pressure on Palestinian militants to stop firing the inaccurate, homemade Qassams, which -- on Friday night, at least -- fell harmlessly. Before the Israeli Army withdrew from the Gaza Strip last year along with all 9,000 Israeli settlers, it cut down the orchards of Beit Hanun in an earlier effort to prevent the militants from firing rockets toward the Israeli cities of Sederot and Ashkelon, visible from the Abu Odehs' broken house. In a way, the Abu Odehs were lucky. The shell hit their reinforced concrete stairs, which absorbed some of the impact. But the roof of some upper-story rooms collapsed, the walls of two bedrooms crumbled, windows blew out and closed doors were blown out of their frames, one of them hitting a wall and coming to rest across the top of a crib where a baby slept. Abdel Rahman Abu Odeh, 13, Muhammad's son, was up on the roof filling a water bottle from the tap. Shrapnel pierced his thigh and threw him down, and his trousers filled with blood. His mother held up a pair of jeans that looked as though they had been dipped in a vat of rusty brown paint. Abdel Rahman, pale and sweaty, lay on a mat in the house, his trousers rolled up over a thick bandage around his thigh. ''It hurts,'' he said, then said it again. He said he remembered very little except filling the water bottle, the harsh whistling of the shell and the explosion. ''Then they jumped on me and took me to the hospital,'' he said. On the ride, he said, he watched ''the blood fill my clothes.'' There is still a piece of shrapnel in his leg, and he will need an operation in two weeks, said his uncle, Moussa Abu Odeh, who lives around the corner. There are school exams in a few weeks, and the family is afraid that Abdel Rahman will miss them, Moussa said as he tried to hold down 5-year-old Muhammad, who had a bandage on his chin. Moussa and the elder Muhammad both used to work construction in Israel, with farming more of a family exercise than their main source of income. Now all that has stopped with the closing of the Erez crossing into Israel for nearly all Palestinian workers. ''We have started to live our lives more simply,'' Moussa said. ''I used to eat meat twice a week, but now it's less. We get food packages from the United Nations and charitable organizations,'' he added, mostly containing staples like rice and cooking oil, ''and sometimes I can work a day here and there.'' In fact, Moussa had just returned from a protest rally of unemployed workers at the offices of the European Union and the United Nations, he said. ''We gave them a letter explaining our bad situation,'' he said, ''and asking for aid to continue to the Palestinian Authority,'' now run by the militant faction Hamas. ''We were depending for help on our relatives who worked in the Palestinian Authority,'' Moussa said. ''But now they need help, because they have no salaries.'' The authority paid February salaries in mid-March, but March and April salaries, due on the last day of the month, have not been paid, in part because Israel refuses to hand over tax receipts, and the West refuses to give budget aid, to a government run by Hamas, which is listed as a terrorist group. All told, seven Palestinians were wounded in the day of shelling, including another youngster in Beit Hanun. Since the Israelis pulled out of Gaza last September, 175 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli actions, and 34 Israelis (28 civilians, 3 soldiers and 3 foreigners) have been killed by Palestinians, according to B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization. The Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group gives similar figures: 170 Palestinians and 30 Israelis killed. In the same period, the Palestinian group says, 713 Palestinians were wounded, compared with 176 Israelis, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry. Captain Dallal, the army spokesman, says the Israeli shelling has helped to reduce the number of Qassam rockets fired to 13 in the last week from 32 in the first week of April, with a total of 83 for the month, compared with 134 fired during March. ''We have to stop this firing into Israel,'' he said. ''Otherwise the situation will escalate, and a ground operation will cause many more casualties.'' Muhammad Abu Odeh held out his hand, which was filled with shrapnel. ''I have no money to fix this house,'' he said. ''I don't know what will happen. At least, thanks be to God, everyone is alive.'' Beit Hanun Journal"
"FIVE summers ago, a car bomb exploded in Netanya, an Israeli city on the Mediterranean, and everyone's first reaction was to fear the worst. It had to be another terrorist attack, people figured. Netanya, lying a mere 10 miles from the West Bank, had become all too vulnerable to Palestinian suicide bombers. But assumptions turned out to be wrong. The attack, which proved nonfatal, was the work of Israeli criminals, the police said. One mobster had tried to do in another. What a relief, people said; it wasn't terrorism. ''I prefer a criminal attack,'' Yehuda Madar of Netanya told me at the time. These days, New York has that in common with faraway Netanya. Bad things happen here, some bearing the potential for a huge loss of life. But as long as they are not the work of terrorists in search of martyrdom or who knows what, our reaction tends to be the same as it was in Netanya: Whew! We dodged a bullet. We experienced the phenomenon this week after an explosion destroyed a town house on East 62nd Street and wounded a few people, including the doctor who owned the property. First came fears of terrorism. Then came relieved sighs. From what the police say, the doctor, chasing whatever demons, may have blown up his own house. What a lucky break for us, most New Yorkers said. But why the high fives? With an altered circumstance or two -- say, people walking by at the wrong moment -- dozens could have been killed. The fact is that, despite the terror and high body count of Sept. 11, 2001, New Yorkers are far more likely to be maimed or killed by a deranged fellow citizen than by someone with a Qaeda decoder ring. A few weeks ago, a man wounded four people during a 13-hour stabbing spree in Manhattan. Five people were stabbed in a similar rampage last year, three others in yet another attack the year before. Remember the driver who went on a hit-and-run spree in Midtown four years ago, killing a pedestrian and injuring two dozen others? Barely a weekend passes without some drunken dope losing control of his car and killing three, four, five or more innocents. The list is long. So why do we derive comfort from knowing that a disaster is caused by a disturbed soul or a souse? Mayhem is mayhem. And unless New York undergoes radical change, we are likely to have many more demented people among us than terrorists. ''We tend to underreact to risks that are familiar -- they kind of recede into the background -- and overreact to risks that are new, in part because we don't know how bad they are,'' said George Loewenstein, a professor of psychology and economics at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Car wrecks and people going crazy -- those are ''known risks,'' Dr. Loewenstein said. But terrorism, 9/11 notwithstanding, still falls into an ''unknown-risk category,'' and that is scary. Paul Slovic, a psychologist who is president of Decision Research, a research institution in Eugene, Ore., said that ''terrorist acts unnerve us because they do not follow the normal 'disaster plot,' which has a beginning, middle and end. We don't know what the scope of the planned aggression is.'' ''Terrorism, perverse as it is, has a rationality to it,'' Dr. Slovic said. ''This seems worse than the deeds of one who is 'not in their right mind.' The 'right mind' of the terrorist wants to terrorize us.'' With the town house explosion, there is an added factor, said Anthony R. Mawson, a professor of public health at Jackson State University in Jackson, Miss. Many people, he said, view the doctor as ''a man to be pitied rather than one to be feared.'' BUT what if that attitude were to change? What if we began to regard the one who caused the explosion, whoever he was, as no better than a terrorist? Dr. Kerry J. Sulkowicz, a Manhattan psychoanalyst, said he would not be surprised if some New Yorkers now walk nervously past town houses wondering if they might go boom. ''It is, of course, highly unlikely,'' Dr. Sulkowicz said. ''But that's the effect of terrorism, to make people think that way.'' For now anyway, we remain in Netanya mode: relieved that what occurred on 62nd Street falls comfortably into ''the not-threatening-to-me category,'' as Dr. Loewenstein put it. It might be worth noting, though, that bombs have gone off in Netanya several times in the last few years, with casualties in the dozens. That feeling of relief? It didn't last long.

"Investigators poring over the wreckage of an Upper East Side town house removed sections of plastic tubing yesterday that they had said had been used by someone to tamper with the main gas line. The tubing was pulled from the rubble of what was once the centerpiece in a long-running divorce fight, and was sent out for tests. On Monday, a little more than an hour before the house blew up, the only person inside, Dr. Nicholas Bartha, 66, sent his ex-wife an e-mail message that said, ''I always told you I will leave the house only if I am dead.'' Dr. Bartha remained in critical condition yesterday at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital with second- and third-degree burns over 35 to 40 percent of his body. Police officials said detectives had not been able to question him, in part, because he was breathing with a respirator. On the block of 62nd Street between Madison and Park Avenues where the town house once stood, more displaced residents of the apartment building next door returned home yesterday, some dressed exactly as they were when they were evacuated on Monday. On orders from the city, 13 apartments in the building, Cumberland House, remained off limits, their windows boarded up. The department also ordered the private club on the other side of the town house, the Links Club, to remain closed until the rubble could be cleared and what had been the basement of the town house could be filled in with dirt. Officials opened the sidewalk on the north side of 62nd Street to pedestrians. But John Buneta, the citywide emergency coordinator for the city's Office of Emergency Management, said the sidewalk on the south side, where the town house stood at 34 East 62nd Street, and the street itself would remain closed to traffic, possibly until early next week. For much of the morning yesterday, a yellow earth-moving machine picked up rubble, one big scoop at a time, and dropped it as gently as possible in the middle of the street. There, firefighters with shovels picked through it. Sometimes they got down on their hands and knees and pulled out items -- a charred book, for example. And then, around 1:30 p.m., the tubing. ''This is the hose,'' Deputy Fire Chief Tom McKavanagh said. ''This is what they have been looking for.'' ''Exactly where it led, I'm not sure,'' he added. On Tuesday, fire officials said they were trying to determine how far into the house the tubing had run. It had been attached to the main gas line at the front of the house, they said, describing a valve where the connection had been made. Yesterday, they said that they had found clamps that could have been used to attach the tubing to the gas line. Investigators stretched the pipe along the street outside the house, where they measured and photographed it. ''There could be a few pieces left in the rubble,'' said Chief McKavanagh, who estimated that 20 to 24 feet of tubing had been found and removed. One former tenant, Dr. Alan Winter, said the building had been plagued by problems with gas odors. ''It was perpetual,'' said Dr. Winter, who moved out in May after three years in the building. ''There were days that my staff had to leave that it was nauseating because the gas smell was so bad.'' His first reaction when he heard the explosion -- he now works from an office a block from the town house -- was, ''The gas finally went.'' But a Con Edison spokesman, Michael S. Clendenin, said a check of the company's service records showed only two calls for gas odors in the last four years. In 2002, he said, ''we went and checked, but there was nothing.'' On June 8, a meter reader reported smelling gas, and a crew was sent to check for leaks. Mr. Clendenin said they found ''gas leaks from some threaded fittings where a pipe screws into another.'' Con Edison shut off service to the building and told Dr. Bartha to have the problem repaired. The gas was turned on the following day, after Con Edison tested the line to make sure it was no longer leaking. Besides Dr. Bartha, one other person was hospitalized with injuries from the explosion, Jennifer Panicali, 22, a Parks Department employee. She remained in stable condition at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell yesterday."
"The physician suspected of blowing up his $6 million town house on the Upper East Side as a way of taking vengeance on his former wife has died from the burns and other injuries he suffered in the blast, a hospital spokeswoman said yesterday. Dr. Nicholas Bartha, 66, died at 11 p.m. on Saturday, said Mary Halston, an administrator at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital. Dr. Bartha, whose condition was complicated by obesity -- he weighed about 350 pounds -- and diabetes, had developed an infection and was breathing with the help of a ventilator. In addition to Dr. Bartha, 10 firefighters and 5 passers-by were injured in the blast last week. The most seriously injured, Jennifer Panicali, 22, was treated for injuries from flying debris and glass at the same hospital and was released on Saturday. Dr. Bartha, an internist, was never formally accused of causing the explosion, which investigators said resulted from a tampered gas line, but he was the prime suspect from the beginning, according to the authorities. Investigators, however, were never able to interview Dr. Bartha, whom doctors placed in a medically induced coma because of the gravity of his injuries. As a result of a protracted court fight following a ferocious divorce, Dr. Bartha was ordered to sell the town house, valued at nearly $6.4 million, and share the proceeds with his ex-wife, Cordula Hahn. Dr. Bartha had vowed never to surrender the building. In a rambling e-mail message to Ms. Hahn sent hours before the explosion, he wrote: ''You always wanted me to sell the house. I always told you, 'I will leave the house only if I am dead.' You ridiculed me. You should have taken it seriously.'' He also wrote, ''When you read this lines your life will change forever. You deserve it. You will be transformed from gold digger to ash and rubbish digger.'' Polly Passonneau, a lawyer for Ms. Hahn, said yesterday that her client would have no comment on her ex-husband's death. A lawyer for Dr. Bartha, Ira Garr, said, ''It's a very sad conclusion to a very tragic story.'' About two weeks before the explosion, Mark Baum, Dr. Bartha's real estate agent, received a message that Dr. Bartha might be willing to sell the town house, something the doctor had not considered seriously three months earlier. On July 7, however, three days before the explosion, Dr. Bartha was served with eviction papers because of the court battle over the property. And then on the morning of the explosion, Mr. Baum and others received a copy of the e-mail message that he had sent to Ms. Hahn. ''The house represented his life, and he destroyed both,'' Mr. Baum said. Dr. Bartha, a Romanian, and Ms. Hahn, who is from the Netherlands, met in 1973; he was a medical student at the University of Rome, where she had just earned a doctorate in German literature. They moved to the home of his parents in Rego Park, Queens, in 1974, married three years later and soon had two daughters, Serena and Johanna. In 1986, the young family moved into the town house, a landmark building in one of Manhattan's most famous and storied neighborhoods. In October 2001, his wife filed for divorce and moved with their daughters to a small apartment in Washington Heights. Correction: August 9, 2006, Wednesday An article in some copies on July 16 about neighbors whose apartments were damaged when the Upper East Side town house of Dr. Nicholas Bartha exploded misstated the number of passers-by injured. (The error was repeated in an article on July 17 about the death of the doctor, who was suspected of blowing up the building.) Four passers-by were hurt, not five."
"A mob of gunmen went on a brazen daytime rampage through a predominantly Sunni Arab district of western Baghdad on Sunday, pulling people from their cars and homes and killing them in what officials and residents called a spasm of revenge by Shiite militias for the bombing of a Shiite mosque on Saturday. Hours later, two car bombs exploded beside a Shiite mosque in another Baghdad neighborhood in a deadly act of what appeared to be retaliation. While Baghdad has been ravaged by Sunni-Shiite bloodletting in recent months, even by recent standards the violence here on Sunday was frightening, delivered with impunity by gun-wielding vigilantes on the street. In the culture of revenge that has seized Iraq, residents all over the city braced for an escalation in the cycle of retributive mayhem between the Shiites and Sunnis that has threatened to expand into civil war. The violence coincided with an announcement by American military officials that they had formally accused four more American soldiers of rape and murder, and a fifth soldier of ''dereliction of duty'' for failing to report the crimes, in connection with the deaths of a teenage Iraqi girl and three members of her family. With movement in Baghdad difficult after a military cordon was established to suppress the violence, facts were hard to ascertain. The death toll from the shootings alone ranged from fewer than a dozen, according to the American military, to more than 40 reported by some news services. The bombing near the mosque later claimed at least 19 lives and left 59 wounded, officials said. The military's announcement about the soldiers brought to six the number implicated in the rape-murder, one more than previously disclosed. The case has enraged Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki and led to apologies by the highest American military and civilian officials in Iraq. A photograph of the girl's passport distributed by news agencies on Sunday showed that she was 14. Only seven weeks old, Mr. Maliki's government is facing increasingly difficult obstacles. Worsening violence has undermined his intention to disarm the country's sectarian militias. At the same time, the growing furor over criminal accusations against American troops has tested Mr. Maliki's divided loyalties to his American allies and to an Iraqi public that has grown weary of the American presence. The killings on Sunday in the western Baghdad neighborhood of Jihad began in late morning, near the site of a car bomb explosion in front of a Shiite mosque on Saturday, residents and officials said. Initial reports said the bombing had killed three people, but the American military said Sunday that at least 12 people, including 3 children, had died in the blast, and at least 18 had been wounded. According to some residents and Sunni Arab officials interviewed by telephone, the gunmen, whom they accused of being members of a feared Shiite militia, the Mahdi Army, set up checkpoints around the neighborhood, indiscriminately pulled scores of Sunni Arabs from their homes and cars and killed them on the street. Other bodies were found with their hands bound behind their backs and gunshots in their heads, residents said. But as often happens in Iraq, accounts of the violence varied widely. Residents and some Iraqi officials said in interviews that more than 35 people had been killed in the attacks. The Associated Press quoted Lt. Maitham Abdul-Razzaq of the Iraqi police as saying that 41 bodies had been taken to hospitals. And an official at Yarmouk Hospital, the main medical center in western Baghdad, said in a telephone interview that at least 23 bodies had been delivered from Jihad, and 10 people had arrived wounded from the shootings. But American and some Iraqi security officials said the casualty figures were far lower. Lt. Col. Jonathan B. Withington, spokesman for the Fourth Infantry Division, which oversees security around Baghdad, said the Iraqi police had reported finding only 11 bodies. It was unclear whether that toll included victims delivered to the morgue. American and Iraqi security officials also said they could not confirm the accounts of the seemingly arbitrary street killings, and Colonel Withington said the Iraqi security forces were mobilized immediately after reports of ''sporadic gunfire'' in Jihad. By early afternoon, Iraqi and American forces had sealed off the neighborhood, officials said. Several prominent Sunni Arab political and religious leaders criticized the Iraqi and American security forces for their inability to control the violence. In comments broadcast on Al Jazeera, Salam al-Zubaie, a deputy prime minister and a Sunni, called the events in Jihad ''a real massacre,'' and suggested that the country's Shiite-led security forces were to blame because they had been infiltrated by militiamen. The government forces, he said, ''coordinate with these filthy terror groups who are roaming the streets.'' Mr. Maliki's office, in a statement, tried to distance itself from Mr. Zubaie's comments, saying ''they do not represent the government's point of view.'' Mr. Maliki, a Shiite, has vowed to crack down on militias regardless of sectarian affiliation and to eradicate militia influence from the government's security forces. In recent days, American and Iraqi troops have conducted several operations against the powerful Mahdi Army militia, which is loosely under the control of the influential Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, and is regarded by Sunni Arab leaders as a main force behind many sectarian reprisal killings. Iraqi and American forces captured two Mahdi Army leaders on Friday and raided a suspected militia bastion on Saturday. Some Jihad residents and Sunni Arab leaders accused the Mahdi Army of committing the killings on Sunday, but officials in Mr. Sadr's organization denied that. ''The Mahdi Army takes care of the national interest,'' Abdel Hadi al-Daraji, a spokesman for Mr. Sadr, told Al Jazeera. Mr. Sadr joined other government leaders in publicly calling for calm, and he requested an emergency session of Parliament to discuss the crisis and ''prevent a sea of blood,'' his office said in a statement. President Jalal Talabani warned Iraqis against falling prey to ''acts of violence that some want to look sectarian.'' Militias of all stripes appeared to be bracing for fallout from the morning's attacks. Mahdi Army fighters interviewed by telephone said they were preparing for a wider battle. Mahdi militiamen had set up checkpoints in the city's predominantly Shiite neighborhoods and, according to residents, were preparing for Sunni reprisals. A Mahdi Army platoon commander who identified himself only as Sheik Faleh said, ''If anything happens, we will attack.'' Later in the day, the deadly double-car bombing next to a Shiite mosque in Kasra, a mixed neighborhood in northeastern Baghdad, also seemed intended to stoke sectarian fury. Seven people were killed and at least eight wounded in various insurgent attacks around Kirkuk, including a bomb that exploded in a bus, killing one civilian and wounding seven, the police said. In Samarra, gunmen assassinated a top official in the Iraqi Islamic Party, a Sunni organization, and two of his guards, the police said, while in Karbala, a police captain was killed. The American command here said an American soldier was killed early on Sunday in the greater Baghdad area in a ''noncombat-related incident,'' but did not elaborate. In the rape-murder case, the American military did not identify the five newly accused soldiers, who remain on active duty in Iraq. The first to be implicated was Steven D. Green, a recently discharged private first class arrested June 30 in North Carolina on suspicion of participating in the crimes on March 12. A affidavit filed in the case against Mr. Green implicated five soldiers: Mr. Green; three soldiers who accompanied him to the farmhouse in the town of Mahmudiya, 20 miles south of Baghdad, where investigators say the rape and murders took place; and another soldier who remained at a checkpoint. But the new accusations, made Saturday and disclosed Sunday, indicate that another soldier was also inside the farmhouse at the time of the crimes, according to a military official who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss such details. The soldier who has been accused of dereliction of duty is, according to the military statement on Sunday, ''not alleged to have been a direct participant in the rape and killings,'' suggesting that it was the soldier who was aware of the plan but stayed at the checkpoint. The formal accusations against the five soldiers set in motion the military's court-martial process. According to military officials, the soldiers will now face an investigation under Article 32 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, a process similar to a grand jury hearing, which will determine whether enough evidence exists to put the men on trial. THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: SECTARIAN CLASHES Correction: July 12, 2006, Wednesday Because of a production error, a front-page article on Monday about an escalation of violence in Baghdad omitted part of a sentence just before the continuation of the article in some copies. It should have read: The death toll from the shootings alone ranged from fewer than a dozen, according to the American military, to more than 40 reported by some news services."
"Israel will continue its military offensive in the Gaza Strip at its own pace until Palestinian militants release a captured Israeli soldier and halt their rocket attacks, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told his cabinet on Sunday. The operation in Gaza is a ''war for which it is impossible to set a timetable,'' Mr. Olmert said, according to briefings provided by an Israeli official. ''We will continue this battle with level-headedness and patience, while making use of the proper means,'' he is reported to have said. ''We cannot sit and not respond to the Qassam rocket fire.'' Mr. Olmert ruled out negotiations with Hamas, which leads the Palestinian government and whose military branch is holding Cpl. Gilad Shalit, who was abducted during a raid into Israel on June 25. He said he had been prepared to release prisoners to Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, before the two men met for a formal meeting, and Mr. Abbas confirmed that on Friday. But Mr. Olmert said Sunday, ''We intended to release them to moderate elements, not terrorist elements.'' Releasing prisoners to Hamas in response to a kidnapping would further damage Palestinian moderates and reward extremism, Mr. Olmert said. He repeated to the cabinet that Israel would not reoccupy Gaza but would act militarily there as it saw fit. ''We will operate, enter and pull out as needed,'' the official quoted Mr. Olmert as saying. Maj. Gen. Yoav Galant, commander of Israel's southern region, said late Saturday that Israel was ready for a long campaign, planning to shift the focus of operations from place to place. ''We are prepared to continue the operation a month, two months and, if need be, even more,'' he told Channel 2 television. ''The Palestinians will do their reckoning. They will count hundreds of dead terrorists, they will count the damaged infrastructure, the destroyed offices, the damaged factories.'' On Sunday, the Palestinians counted more dead, even as they mourned and buried four people, including three from the same family, killed Saturday night in the Shijaia neighborhood, near the Karni commercial crossing, in an explosion at a house. The Palestinians blamed Israel. But Israel said that its investigation showed that the explosion did not come from an airstrike, and that intelligence reports later showed that the deaths had been caused by a Palestinian anti-tank rocket. Capt. Jacob Dallal, a spokesman for the military, said the Israeli Air Force, which tracks its missiles carefully, reported that its missile ''hit the intended target,'' which was a nearby street where armed militants were walking with weapons. He said the army did not know what happened to those men, but ''we hit the area we targeted, not the house.'' An Israeli military official said intelligence information developed later, presumably from a source within Gaza, ''clearly says that it was a Palestinian anti-tank missile.'' The military official insisted on not being identified and said he could not be more specific. On Sunday, a Palestinian civilian was killed by an Israeli missile fired at a car carrying Hamas militants in the southern town of Rafah. The militants apparently escaped from the car, and a second missile hit nearby, wounding bystanders. The dead man was identified as Bilal Sliman Rabah, an 18-year-old supermarket clerk. Seven other Palestinians were wounded, with one in very serious condition, hospital authorities said. Earlier Sunday, just after midnight, the air force struck a group of armed militants near the Karni commercial crossing, wounding three, members of the Palestinian security forces said. Airstrikes also destroyed a major bridge in Beit Hanun, in northern Gaza, and an electricity transformer there, making it difficult to travel easily to the city and cutting electricity and some water supplies. Palestinians continued to fire Qassam rockets into Israel despite the military operation. One resident of the nearby Israeli town of Sderot was moderately wounded Sunday morning from shrapnel wounds to the chest when a Qassam hit. A second rocket hit a house, and three people were treated for shock. Three of the four Palestinians killed Saturday in the house explosion were members of the Hajaj family -- Um Ayman Hajaj, 48; her son Muhammad, 21; and her daughter Rawan, 6. Four other family members were wounded. The house is on the very edge of the Palestinian area closest to the Karni crossing into Israel. Iman Hajaj, 23, one of Mrs. Hajaj's 14 children, said she was in the house's living room during the explosion, where some were watching an Egyptian soap opera. Those people were wounded, she said; those who died were in the garden drinking tea or cooking corn over a fire. ''We had been nervous for two days with the movement of tanks and the shells,'' Ms. Hajaj said, sitting in a room of mourning women, all covered in black head scarves and long black robes, in a relative's house nearby. ''My brother Muhammad, who died, had just arrived a minute before to visit my married sister,'' Ms. Hajaj said, beginning to cry, then held out her hand, holding a curved piece of shrapnel. ''More than 20 pieces like this we took from the body of my mother,'' she said. As she spoke, young women who lined the banister of the stairway all began to chant in unison, ''With our souls, with our blood, we sacrifice ourselves for our martyr!'' Um Hassan Hajaj, the aunt of the dead mother, spoke angrily about what she said was the responsibility of Israel and the United States for the deaths in her family. ''Look at what your weapons are doing to us!'' she yelled. As the television cameras came closer, she turned to them and shouted: ''One day the Muslim countries will change everything, and there will be hard days for America! Injustice never lasts.'' As the bodies of the dead were brought, wrapped in the flags of Islamic Jihad and Fatah, there was screaming and ululating and the cascading sounds of gunfire from the militants surging around the courtyard. The militants wore various forms of mufti, waving weapons and flags, including the green of Hamas. As the small body of Rawan was carried, tiny in the stretcher, her face exposed, the wailing swelled, and Um Fathi Hajaj, the girl's grandmother, collapsed in tears. As he walked along the route of the funeral march, Abu Ahmed, the spokesman for the Islamic Jihad's military wing, quietly promised retribution. ''We have 70 suicide bombers in a new brigade awaiting orders to strike Israel,'' he said. Asked whether Islamic Jihad would respect a negotiated political document calling for Palestinian military activity to concentrate on Israel proper, he smiled wearily. ''All of historic Palestine is ours, and we don't distinguish between 1948 or 1967,'' he said. Mr. Abbas, back in Ramallah, ordered two representatives to discuss the crisis with Syria and with the exiled leader of Hamas's political bureau, Khaled Meshal. On Friday, in a news conference, Mr. Abbas said he did not know of any splits in Hamas and dealt only with the elected Hamas prime minister, Ismail Haniya, who called in vain for a mutual cease-fire on Saturday, quickly rejected by Israel without Corporal Shalit's release. The Israeli Army also announced after an investigation that the only Israeli soldier who has died in this nearly two-week Gaza operation was accidentally killed by Israeli fire."
"When Nicholas Bartha's townhouse on East 62nd Street blew up -- in what investigators think was his suicidal attempt to punish his ex-wife for divorcing him -- the explosion created a legal mess as big as the pile of rubble the blast left behind. As Dr. Bartha, 66, was buried at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Queens on Wednesday, in a quiet family ceremony, lawyers for the family, the injured, the neighbors and New York City began sorting out various claims to the property. So far, no will has surfaced, and Dr. Bartha's former lawyer, Ira E. Garr, and the referee in his divorce, Marilyn Dershowitz, speculated that he was too disorganized to leave a will behind, or that if he did, it was destroyed along with his house and its other contents. If no will emerges, legal experts said, his adult children, Serena and Johanna, inherit everything. The two daughters together owned 25 percent of the house already, while Dr. Bartha owned the rest. His ex-wife, Cordula Hahn, will become one of many creditors, seeking to collect the $4 million judgment she won during divorce proceedings. Other creditors could include the city, which paid for cleanup, people injured by the blast and neighbors whose apartments were damaged. ''It's very complicated,'' Donna Bennick, Ms. Hahn's lawyer, said of the disposition of the estate. ''I'm trying to unravel it myself.'' Since it appears that the mother and daughters have a good relationship, it seems unlikely that the daughters would contest their mother's claim to any proceeds from the property, lawyers said. ''So all roads ultimately lead to Rome,'' Charles F. Crames, an estate and trust lawyer in Manhattan, said this week. It was a court judgment ordering Dr. Bartha to be evicted and the house to be sold as a way of satisfying his ex-wife's claim that seemed to precipitate what may have been Dr. Bartha's decision to destroy the house. Investigators said a gas line had been tampered with before the blast. Dr. Bartha was the only person in the house when it exploded on the morning of July 10. He was plucked from the rubble and died in the hospital five days later. Property was an emotional issue for Dr. Bartha. In a rambling, often incoherent e-mail message sent to his ex-wife before the explosion, he said one of his earliest memories was of hiding in a cave in his native Romania during World War II. In a tale of wounded family pride, he told how his father owned a gold mine, which was nationalized after the war. The family lost its home in the village of Rosia Montana, Romania, he wrote, and his mother was obsessed with getting it back, to no avail. Dr. Bartha's parents bought the town house at 34 East 62nd Street in 1980 for $395,000, according to court records, but did not move in until 1986. Ms. Dershowitz said the price of the house was low for the time because it was occupied by tenants who had to move out before the Barthas could move in. In his final e-mail message, Dr. Bartha indicated that he did not want his daughters to inherit the house. Berating his ex-wife, apparently over the divorce, he wrote, ''Cordula with this you disinherited your children.'' ''The ultimate irony would be that she gets to administer the estate,'' Harold A. Mayerson, former chairman of the Matrimonial Law Committee for the New York City Bar Association, said of Ms. Hahn. If a will is found that cuts the daughters out of the estate, they could conceivably contest it by challenging his mental competency at the time he made the will, lawyers said. ''You have a right to disinherit a child,'' Mr. Crames said. ''However, if there is no will, no matter how bad your attitude toward your children, your spouse inherits first, and then your children. In this case, there is no spouse, because they were divorced.'' Dr. Bartha has nephews, who unsuccessfully tried to claim a share of the house from Dr. Bartha's mother after she died, according to court papers. Phone messages left for one of the nephews, Thomas Bartha, were not returned. Eric Proshansky, a lawyer for New York City, said the city was considering filing a claim for cleanup costs, but had not calculated how much that would be. The city's claim would go first in line, followed by the ex-wife's. The property, worth $6 million when the house was standing, is probably worth about $7 million as a hole in the ground, said Guthrie Garvin, a broker who is director of sales from East 60th to East 76th Street for Massey Knakal, a brokerage firm. He said the property would probably be sold for a town house. ''There is a great appetite for town houses in that area,'' he said. ''With the price of town houses in that area, you're right in prime territory.'' While the ghoulish history of the property might scare off some buyers, Mr. Garvin said, there is always someone undeterred, attracted by the chance to build a dream house. ''That's the kind of area where you're going to have a very sophisticated buyer and somebody who's going to do a top-of-the-line renovation,'' he said. Dr. Bartha's former lawyer, Mr. Garr, said the doctor had little or no assets apart from the house and perhaps some retirement funds. Ms. Dershowitz, the divorce referee, said that Dr. Bartha had aspired to be a cardiologist but had never qualified as one. Instead, he had worked all his career as an emergency room doctor. She said he had lived very frugally, cooking with a microwave and a hot plate."
"A man distraught over the end of a relationship seals his kitchen door with packing tape, turns on the oven gas and prepares to die from asphyxiation. Instead, an explosion rips through brick and plaster, more than 100 of his neighbors are evacuated, but the man, surprisingly, survives. It was three years ago that Larry Feingold, an administrative law judge, blew up his apartment and seriously damaged three floors of his Stuyvesant Town building. Eight other people, including three firefighters, were slightly injured as a result of his suicide attempt. Although many of the details are different, the Feingold case may offer a suggestion of what lies ahead for Dr. Nicholas Bartha, should he be charged with intentionally causing the blast that leveled his Upper East Side town house on Monday morning. Dr. Bartha, who was dealing with the aftermath of a contentious divorce, was in a medically induced coma yesterday with severe burns over much of his body. Investigators believe he may have tampered with a gas line in an effort to destroy the East 62nd Street building and deprive his former wife of the proceeds from its sale. Fifteen people, 10 of them firefighters, were injured. Mr. Feingold, three years later, has recovered from his injuries, his lawyers said. He is facing litigation from two insurance companies, one of which is seeking to recoup the $1.7 million it paid to the owner of his apartment complex, according to court records. In 2004, he was convicted of first-degree reckless endangerment and sentenced to five years of probation. Because he was convicted of a felony, he automatically lost his license to practice law. At the time of his trial, Mr. Feingold, now 55, said he was despondent after breaking up with his longtime lover, Roy Abbott, and was simply trying to end his life. Shortly after Mr. Abbott packed up and left, Mr. Feingold blew out the pilot light on his stove, swallowed a handful of tranquilizers and lay down in front of the open door to the oven. Five hours later, the refrigerator compressor set off an explosion that turned adjacent apartments to rubble, blasted out scores of windows and sent Mr. Feingold's air conditioner hurtling into the courtyard 11 stories below. During the trial, Mr. Feingold told the court he had not known cooking gas was explosive. Mr. Feingold, who now lives with relatives on Long Island, did not return a call seeking comment, but his lawyers were willing to speak of how the case has affected their client. ''His life has absolutely been destroyed,'' said Ronald Kliegerman, who represented him at his trial. ''It was bad enough that he tried to commit suicide, but to have this case heaped on him, to lose your job and be disbarred, that's unbearable.'' Mr. Feingold's situation improved slightly last week when the state's highest court reduced his conviction, transforming his felony into a misdemeanor. As a result, Mr. Feingold, who worked for the city's Environmental Control Board, can ask that his law license be reinstated, and he stands to have his sentence reduced. ''It's a significant victory,'' said Barry Fallick, the lawyer who handled the appeal. ''It backs our contention that he never intended to hurt anyone except himself.'' It remains to be seen whether the Court of Appeals decision will affect Dr. Bartha's future. The Manhattan district attorney declined to comment, but Mr. Feingold's lawyers were quick to point out the difference between the two cases: Mr. Feingold, they said, was guilty of a poorly planned suicide, while law enforcement officials say they believe Dr. Bartha intended to destroy the building and end his life. Three years later, it is difficult to spot any traces of the blast that destroyed or damaged 24 apartments at 21 Stuyvesant Oval. The halls are freshly painted and about half the tenants who were displaced for a year or more have returned. Some tenants, like Connie Buro, said she had little sympathy for Mr. Feingold, who should have sought a less destructive way of coping with his emotional distress. ''It was traumatizing to be thrown out of your home for almost two years,'' said Ms. Buro, an educator who lives a few doors down from Mr. Feingold's former apartment. ''Couldn't these crazy people find themselves a good therapist instead of blowing things up?''"
"More than 50 people were killed in Baghdad on Tuesday in violence that included a double suicide bombing near busy entrances to the fortified Green Zone, scattered shootings, mortar attacks, a series of car bombs and the ambush of a bus with Shiite mourners returning from a burial. Tuesday's killings, many of them apparently carried out with sectarian vengeance, raised the three-day death toll in the capital alone to well over 100, magnified the daunting challenges facing the new government and deepened a sense of dread among Iraqis. Many of the attacks, particularly those in neighborhoods primarily populated by one religious group or another, bore the hallmarks of sectarian militias, both Sunni Arab and Shiite. Militias now appear to be dictating the ebb and flow of life in Iraq, and have left the new government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki and his American counterparts scrambling to come up with a military and political strategy to combat them. Mr. Maliki has a security strategy for Baghdad, put in place a month ago, that features a constellation of new checkpoints. Also on Tuesday, Wisam Jabir Abdullah, an Iraqi diplomat posted in Iran who was visiting Baghdad, was kidnapped from his home by gunmen, an Interior Ministry official said. The official requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record. The worsening security crisis in Baghdad and several neighboring provinces, which many Iraqis are saying feels like a low-grade civil war, prompted lawmakers on Tuesday to summon the interior and defense ministers to address Parliament on Thursday, said Jalal Adin al-Saghir, a senior official in the country's largest Shiite political bloc. During the current spike in the violence, Mr. Maliki has been restrained in his comments. On Monday, he made an appeal for national unity during a speech in Iraqi Kurdistan, and during a press conference in Erbil on Tuesday, he dismissed the notion that the country was descending into civil war. ''I don't see the country falling into a civil war, despite the regrettable activities of certain people who ignore that Iraq is united,'' the prime minister said, according to Agence France-Presse. At least eight more people were slain in insurgent attacks outside the capital, including the wife of a provincial governor, who was killed by a bomb while treating patients at her gynecology clinic. But Tuesday's violence was largely concentrated in Baghdad. The country's largest Sunni bloc said that in the interest of promoting calm, it would end its 10-day boycott of Parliament. Sunni legislators suspended their participation on July 2 after a colleague, Tayseer Najah al-Mashhadani, was kidnapped. Many Sunnis have blamed the abduction on the Mahdi Army, a militia loyal to the cleric Moktada al-Sadr. Mr. Sadr and his deputies, however, have denied any involvement. Alaa Makki, a Sunni leader, said in a telephone interview that the bloc's decision to participate once again was influenced by Mr. Sadr, who on Sunday issued an appeal for harmony and the convening of a special meeting of Parliament to address the sectarian bloodshed. The sudden surge in violence began Sunday morning when a group of Shiite gunmen appeared on the streets of a predominantly Sunni neighborhood in western Baghdad and began executing people. This vigilantism appeared to come as retribution for the bombing of a Shiite mosque the day before. It was closely followed on Sunday by what seemed to be retributive car bomb attacks against another Shiite mosque. Estimates of the number of killings in Baghdad on Sunday ranged from at least 30 to more than double that number. And at least 30 died in violence on Monday, officials said. In Tuesday's most deadly attack, two pedestrians wearing vests made of explosives blew themselves up near a restaurant outside the walls of the Green Zone, within a few hundred yards of three busy entrances, Iraqi and American officials said. Soon after the initial blasts, a hidden bomb was detonated nearby, adding to the carnage, the American military said. Some Iraqi authorities said the third explosion was caused by a car bomb. At least 15 Iraqi civilians and an Iraqi police officer were killed in the explosions, and 4 people were wounded, according to the American military command. In an Internet posting, two prominent insurgent groups claimed responsibility for the attacks. The Mujahedeen Shura Council in Iraq said it was behind the two suicide bombings, according to SITE Institute, which monitors jihadist postings on the Internet. The Islamic Army in Iraq claimed in a separate posting that it was responsible for the third explosion, which it said was a car bomb, according to a translation provided by SITE. The claims raise the possibility of a coordinated strike by the two groups, though they do not have a history of working together and, moreover, are thought to be rivals. The Islamic Army said it had struck in revenge for the rape and slaying of an Iraqi girl and the killing of three other family members in Mahmudiya. Five American soldiers, and a recently discharged soldier, have been implicated the case. In a predominantly Sunni area of Dawra, a district in southern Baghdad, gunmen ambushed a bus carrying Shiite mourners from the holy city of Najaf, where they had buried a relative, government officials and family members said. The gunmen pulled 10 people from the bus and executed them, the Interior Ministry official said. An hour earlier, in Taji, north of Baghdad, gunmen ambushed another bus, killing one person and wounding five, the official said. Two mortar grenades hit a Shiite mosque in Dawra, killing 9 and wounding 11 civilians, the Interior Ministry official said. In other violence, a family of five -- a father, mother, grown daughter and two teenage sons -- were found beheaded in a predominantly Sunni sector of Dawra, according to an official at Yarmouk Hospital, the main medical facility in western Baghdad. The police and hospital officials also reported that four car bombs around Baghdad killed at least 7 people and wounded at least 18. Gunmen raided a company's offices in the upper-middle-class Mansour neighborhood, killing three employees and wounding three, officials said. According to the official at Yarmouk Hospital, five bodies were discovered early Tuesday in Jihad, the neighborhood where dozens of people were reportedly executed by marauding gunmen on Sunday. It was unclear when the victims had been killed. In Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown, a time bomb exploded in the clinic of Ameera al-Rubaie, the wife of the governor of Salahuddin Province, according to Agence France-Presse, which quoted the local police. Dr. Rubaie, a gynecologist, was killed and four of her patients were wounded, the police said, according to the wire service. In Baquba, north of Baghdad, the mayor of the Um Al Nawa district was assassinated by gunmen, the ministry official said. In the Shiite holy city of Karbala, a drive-by shooting killed two workers in the central market, according to the Interior Ministry official. An engineer and his bodyguard were assassinated on their way to work in Kirkuk on Tuesday morning, according to Col. Adel Zain Alabdin of the Iraqi police. A car bomb in Mosul killed two people and wounded four, the police said. Wijdan Mikhail Salim, Iraq's minister of human rights, said in a telephone interview that a government commission had been formed to study the possibility of scrapping a law that granted American troops immunity from Iraqi prosecution. In the trial of Saddam Hussein, the judges heard the closing arguments of two defendants, Abdullah Kadhum Ruweed and his son, Mizher Abdullah Ruweed, two local Baath Party officials from Dujail, a predominantly Shiite village. Mr. Hussein and seven co-defendants are accused in the torture and execution of 148 men and boys in the village in 1982."
"When American soldiers take to the road they pray they avoid the roadside bombs that seem to explode every day in Iraq. Sgt. First Class Timothy Faust has a very different goal: he hopes to find them. Sergeant Faust's Demon Platoon has the ''route clearing'' mission for Company A, Task Force 1-36. That is the somewhat understated description of an operation that involves driving into a veritable no man's land in hostile Anbar Province to uncover mines, buried artillery shells and all manner of explosive devices, often under sniper fire. The Pentagon has spent millions of dollars on technology to counter the bombs, which the insurgents have continued to install at a furious rate. But as a recent trip with Demon Platoon showed, detecting the bombs -- improvised explosive devices, or I.E.D.'s, as the soldiers call them -- is often a matter of memorizing the location of trash heaps, bomb craters, dirt mounds and construction sites in Hit, a garbage-strewn city of 40,000. A vivid example occurred Saturday, as Sergeant Faust interviewed an Iraqi shopkeeper about who might have planted several mines that were found the night before. Nearby, a member of his platoon noted a fresh pile of debris. ''That was not here before,'' Sgt. John Martin said. Sergeant Faust looked at the pile through his rifle scope and yelled, ''Get out of here.'' With that, the soldiers, the shopkeeper and a reporter and a photographer for The New York Times scampered around the corner toward the platoon's Humvees. An hour and a sniper attack later, an Army explosive-ordnance team drove up in a huge armored truck and directed a small robot to place plastic explosives, called C-4, on the pile. The soldiers plugged their ears as the blast thundered through the city streets and a fountain of flame shot into the sky. Observing the 30-foot ball of fire, Sergeant Faust reported on the radio that his platoon had found an I.E.D., probably one in which explosives had been packed in an acetylene tank to magnify the power of the blast. It was the 71st bomb or mine the platoon had uncovered since it arrived in Hit in February. Hidden bombs have become the insurgents' primary weapon, and the number of explosives they plant is an important measure of their activity and determination to fight. The number is on the rise nationwide. In June, there were 1,481 I.E.D. attacks throughout Iraq, and 903 instances in which the bombs were found and neutralized, according to figures compiled by the American military in Baghdad. That is a sharp increase since January, when there were 834 such attacks and 620 cases in which the bombs were found before they exploded. Many soldiers rate an explosion from one of the bombs as the war's most frightening experience. ''It jerks you around,'' said Pfc. Daniel Rullo, 21, a medic from Binghamton, N.Y., with Company A. ''You squeeze your hands to make sure you are still alive. Lots of times the vehicles fill up with smoke. It is the worst feeling out here, worse than getting shot.'' The battle between the insurgents and the American forces is a grim contest of measure and countermeasure. Armored Humvees and other defensive measures have considerably improved the Americans' ability to survive the bomb attacks. In addition to Kevlar helmets and body armor, each soldier is equipped with special gear to protect against bomb explosions: glasses that deflect flying debris, called ballistic glasses; fire-resistant gloves; and combat earplugs. In a kind of arms race, the insurgents have responded to the American protective measures by stepping up the frequency and power of the bombings. The bunk next to Private Rullo's lies empty. It was occupied by another medic, Pfc. Nolan Howell, who was returning in an armored Humvee from a Demon Platoon mission when he was wounded by shrapnel from a planted bomb. Three artillery shells had been stacked in a mound so that the blast would be channeled to the side of the vehicle. Iraq had a vast arsenal of weapons before the war, few of which were adequately guarded in the chaos that followed the fall of Baghdad. The insurgents have a seemingly inexhaustible supply of artillery shells, mortars and other explosives for making the bombs. In April, one of the task force soldiers made a wrong turn while on patrol and spied a half-buried artillery round. By the end of the day, American troops had yanked 2,000 artillery rounds out of the ground. It was a field of potential bombs. ''I told the soldiers that finding a cache in and of itself is not going to solve the I.E.D. problems,'' said Lt. Col. Thomas C. Graves, the commander of the task force. ''Why caches are good is they may lead us to intel that may get to the guy that is laying the I.E.D.'s.'' Reflecting the insurgents' inventiveness, the bombs in Hit come in a wide variety. Some are ''command detonated,'' connected by wires to a detonator or triggered by electronic signals. There are bombs and mines that are set to explode when a vehicle drives over them. The task force is trying to pinpoint the insurgents who are planting the bombs, and has conducted raids to find them. But as soon as one insurgent cell is broken up, another seems to move in. The level of bomb attacks has been generally constant in the Hit area since February. But there appear to be more strikes in the city and fewer on some of the major routes leading in and out. Either way, what the troops call route clearing is as busy a mission as ever. Sergeant Faust, 35, who was born in Georgia and calls Frederick, Md., home, was trained as a tank platoon sergeant and considers ''tankers'' a special breed of soldiers. ''We can do anybody's job, but nobody can do ours,'' he said. Demon Platoon notes proudly that it finds about 80 percent of the concealed bombs on its routes. The other week, Sergeant Faust was knocked flat on his back when an I.E.D. exploded just moments after he had tossed a few glow lights on the ground to identify the location for the explosive-ordnance team. It is a team effort, however, with plenty of risk to go around. Specialist Travis Tiffany, 21, has endured two explosions in less than a month but never hesitates, Sergeant Faust says, ''to go outside the wire'' of his Army base. Early Saturday morning, before finding the bomb, Sergeant Faust and a team of soldiers in four Humvees left Company A's base, a dilapidated train station on the outskirts of Hit. The platoon, preparing for a mission to clear a route, halted in front of a blue mosque. Someone had spied a filled-in crater, either an I.E.D. or a resident's attempt to fix the road, and Sergeant Faust could not take any chances. Snipers fired three rounds as the soldiers waited for an Army explosive-ordnance team to arrive and blow up the crater. As the platoon drove on, it approached the street where several mines had been detected the night before. The soldiers got out to talk to local residents, while a nearby Iraqi maintenance crew worked unperturbed on a broken water main. Its truck displayed a white flag. That's when Sergeant Martin noticed the unfamiliar stack of debris, and the explosives team returned with its robot to blow up the pile. The large blast and wall of fire that followed provided confirmation that the platoon had found what it was looking for. ''Now that, gentlemen, was an I.E.D.,'' Sergeant Faust said, with obvious satisfaction."
"Investigators digging yesterday through the rubble of a town house on the Upper East Side focused on a plastic hose that had been illegally attached to the building's gas line and could prove central to the cause of the thunderous blast, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly and other officials said. Mr. Kelly said that the main gas line running into the town house, at 34 East 62nd Street, had been tampered with. The only person in the house when it blew up on Monday was Dr. Nicholas Bartha, a 66-year-old internist who remained hospitalized yesterday as investigators tried to determine whether he had had a hand in the tampering. The discovery of parts of the hose came on a day when things began returning to normal on the block, between Madison and Park Avenues. Residents of the Cumberland House apartment building next to the ruined town house returned home after spending Monday night in hotels. In midmorning, half a dozen clothing racks -- each the size of a voting machine, and each covered in thick white cloth -- were wheeled into the Herm√®s store on the corner of Madison Avenue. Stores on the Madison Avenue side of the Cumberland House were open, but steamy: debris from the explosion had knocked out the air-conditioning that kept them cool. The explosion injured 10 firefighters and 5 civilians and reduced the 19th-century building to a smoldering pile of bricks, mortar and wood. Yesterday, even as the Fire Department pumped water from the basement of the four-story town house and a backhoe scooped up debris, questions swirled about what would happen to the lot the town house occupied. Dr. Bartha had been fighting over the town house with his ex-wife, Cordula Hahn. In April, a court ordered him to sell it and pay her more than $4 million. In court papers, she said he had repeatedly declared that he would rather die there. Dr. Bartha told her much the same thing in an e-mail message he sent an hour and 15 minutes before the blast, adding, ''You will be transformed from gold digger to ash and rubbish digger.'' Several law enforcement officials said that investigators believed that Dr. Bartha had tampered with the gas lines in the house. But they said it remained unclear whether he intended to kill himself, as investigators said he had tried to do more than once, or to destroy the house so there would be nothing to sell and no money to turn over to his wife -- or both. Dr. Bartha's real estate agent, Mark Baum, said that Dr. Bartha was something of a handyman and had worked on the house himself. ""He had engineering skills,"" he said. ""He had carpenter skills."" One official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing, said of the gas line, ''I don't know what's in this guy's mind, but it was definitely tampered with.'' Investigators were also seeking to determine whether the furnace and hot water heater had also been tampered with, the official said. The city's chief fire marshal, Louis F. Garcia, said the hose had been attached to a valve near the gas meter. ''This certainly is against any kind of plumbing code,'' he said. ''It shouldn't be there.'' He said that the hose was not there on June 8, when a Con Edison meter reader smelled gas. Michael S. Clendinin, a Con Edison spokesman, said on Monday that a crew sent to the town house found gas leaking from threaded fittings where one section of pipe screws into another. Con Edison cut off the gas service and told Dr. Bartha to arrange for a plumber to do repair work. Con Edison returned the next day, tested the equipment, found no leaks and turned the gas back on. Detectives from the Police Department's Arson and Explosion Squad have been unable to interview the doctor, who remained at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Hospital with second- and third-degree burns over 35 to 40 percent of his body. His medical condition is complicated by obesity -- the authorities estimated his weight at 350 pounds -- and by diabetes, the law enforcement official said. Another official said Dr. Bartha had developed an infection and was breathing with a ventilator. ''He's not doing good,'' the first official said. Dr. Bartha's eldest daughter, Serena, was seen leaving New York-Presbyterian last night. When asked by a reporter how her father was, she said, ''I'm not talking,'' and ran down the street. The only other person hospitalized in the blast was a passer-by, Jennifer Panicali, 22, a recent honors graduate of Hunter College who had worked for the Parks Department's Web site since June 12 and was on her way to work, according to the department. After surgery at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital, she was in stable condition, the department said. The marshals have not determined what ignited the blast. Chief Garcia said that natural gas reaches the explosive range when it replaces 5 percent to 15 percent of the air in an enclosed space. An explosion can be sparked by anything from a telephone to static electricity. The portion of the inch-and-a-half hose that was in the basement, which investigators were looking for in the rubble yesterday, was attached to the main gas line before it reached the meter, fire officials said. The gas line leading out of the meter was much smaller in diameter, one utility official said, suggesting that would have speeded the volume of gas escaping into the house. Chief Garcia said the blast began in the basement, in the front of the house. He said that Dr. Bartha was found on the top of the stairway, on the first floor, directly above where the hose was attached to the gas line. He and other officials said the hose stretched through the basement. By last night Fire Department investigators had determined that it had not reached the furnace at the back wall of the house, though they did not know where it ended, one official said. Police Department officials were careful not to describe Dr. Bartha as a suspect, and he has not been arrested or charged with any crime. But prosecutors in the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, are examining the possibility of bringing felony arson charges against him, officials there said. The blast blew out the windows of apartments in the building next door, the Cumberland House, on the corner of 62nd Street and Madison Avenue, and residents were forced to stay away on Monday night. Yesterday, the building's managing agent, Harry Smith, said the Buildings Department had allowed ''all but a handful'' of residents to return. The apartments in the worst condition, he said, were on low floors overlooking the town house. Firefighters entered those apartments and threaded hoses through the windows to spray water on the blaze. On the other side of the ruined town house is a private club, the Links Club. Repair crews removed the parapet wall at the top of the building and put in a temporary wooden replacement. They also tended to the broken windows. But the manager, Jean-Pierre David, said the building had sustained no major damage. Because the town house had been the centerpiece of a real estate battle, there was speculation about what might take the place of the century-and-a-quarter-old town house, and how much it might cost. The land is worth $6 million to $7 million, said Paul Massey, a founding partner at Massey Knakel Realty, a broker that specializes in town houses. ''There's a better than 50-50 chance the buyer will be a home buyer,'' he said. The property is within a historic district, so the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission would weigh in on the design of the facade for any new structure. The zoning for that block would permit pretty much what was there, a structure with five stories, counting what is called an English basement. Threading their way past police barriers that kept traffic away while the cleanup continued, residents talked about how the town house had attracted little attention until Monday. ''It was the nondescript building on the block,'' said Alan Rogers, who was sitting in a ground-floor office in the Cumberland House building when the town house blew up. But while the explosion put the house in headlines around the world, at least one of Dr. Bartha's patients, Mehrbamoo Poulad, 29, of Jersey City, had no idea that anything had happened until she turned the corner on her way to drop off some insurance forms. ''At first I thought there was some construction,'' she said. Correction: July 15, 2006, Saturday An article on Wednesday about investigators' discovery that the gas line to a town house on the Upper East Side of Manhattan had been tampered with before the house exploded misspelled the surname of a spokesman for Consolidated Edison. He is Michael S. Clendenin, not Clendinin."
"The 12 miners who died in the Sago Mine in West Virginia in January would have survived an explosion in an abandoned section of the mine if the seals cordoning off that area had been properly installed, state mining officials concluded in a report released yesterday. Federal officials responded by saying they would require much stronger seals. ''The fact is, the seals did not do what they were supposed to do,'' said J. Davitt McAteer, head of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration in the Clinton administration, who conducted the investigation at the request of Gov. Joe Manchin III. The explosion, the nation's worst mining disaster in 40 years, occurred on Jan. 2 about 260 feet underground in a section of the mine that had been sealed with foam blocks. The state report is the first official examination of the accident, but it did not address the cause. In some mines, seals are built with concrete blocks. But many large mines, including the Sago Mine, rely on blocks made of dense foam, which are lighter, easier to move and cheaper. Federal mine safety officials imposed a moratorium on the use of foam seals after another mine accident this year. Critics have argued that they are prone to leak and are not substantial enough to contain a significant explosion. Under current rules, the seals are supposed to withstand explosions exerting 20 pounds of pressure per square inch. ''These blocks were pulverized,'' Mr. McAteer said at a news conference in Buckhannon, W. Va. ''Had those seals held, those men would be alive.'' He added that the seals ''were not constructed properly.'' The International Coal Group, which owns the mine, rejected that accusation, saying the seals complied with federal requirements and were built ''using construction techniques that are consistent with industry practice.'' The company added that the physical evidence showed that the force of the explosion exceeded 20 pounds per square inch. Federal mine safety officials said yesterday that they would begin requiring mines to use new alternative seals that could withstand 50 pounds of pressure per square inch. ''Increasing the strength requirements for alternative seals will better protect miners,'' said David G. Dye, acting administrator of the mine safety agency, which officials have said may take further steps after it releases the results of its own investigation in the coming months. The state report also faulted the breathing devices that the miners used and called on Governor Manchin to require that all mines test them more rigorously. In April, the sole survivor of the Sago disaster, Randal McCloy Jr., wrote a letter to the families of the victims saying that at least four of the miners' breathing devices did not work, forcing the men to share their oxygen. Federal mining officials have said the air packs were all in working order. But they have also said that the air packs they recovered had not been used to their full capacity before being discarded by the trapped miners. Similar problems have been reported with the air packs in other mining accidents this year. ''There have been a lot of complaints about this equipment,'' said Phil Smith, a spokesman for the United Mine Workers. ''It's time we find out exactly what is the problem with them.'' The state report also recommended that as of next year, all mines in West Virginia have functioning safety chambers where miners can go if they cannot escape in an emergency. The report did not solve one of the biggest mysteries of the Sagodisaster, what touched off the explosion of methane gas in the sealed part of the mine. In March, International Coal released its own report, concluding that the blast had been set off by lightning and pointing to black marks at a closed section of the mine as proof. But it remains unclear how a lightning strike could have sent an electrical charge to the pocket of methane nearly two miles away and more than 200 feet underground. Families greeted the state report with a mix of frustration and hope. ''Does this give us closure? Definitely not, since there aren't answers to many of the major questions,'' said Peggy Ware Cohen, the daughter of one of the miners killed, Fred G. Ware Jr. ''But the most frustrating part is to see all the ways in which state and federal officials and the mine operator did not follow their own rules.'' Virginia Moore, whose fianc√©, Terry Helms, also died in the accident, said, ''I certainly would like more clear answers, but right now I am just hopeful that the governor will apply the safety recommendations that were put forward by the report.''"
"The graceful town house on East 62nd Street was more than a home to Nicholas Bartha. It was the culmination of his life's work, proof that he had realized the classic immigrant's dream. Dr. Bartha, burned and barely conscious, was pulled from the ruins yesterday morning after the house was nearly leveled by a gas explosion, raining bricks on one of the city's wealthiest streets and sending up thick columns of black smoke. Even before the fires were extinguished, police began focusing on Dr. Bartha as the most likely person to have caused the blast. Just as his historic town house, a landmark used more than half a century ago by American spies, was no ordinary building, Dr. Bartha, 66, was embroiled in a marital split that by all accounts was no ordinary divorce. But he would have done anything to keep that house, including stay married, his lawyer said. He lost one key battle last year when a court ruled that his wife deserved a share of the building, a decision he fought. Then, in April, he was ordered to sell it so he could pay his wife more than $4 million. In court papers, she said he had repeatedly vowed in ominous tones that he would die in that house and that she would never get it. Now there is no house. ''He wanted to stay married,'' said Ira E. Garr, Dr. Bartha's lawyer until last year. ''He wanted to maintain the status quo so he could continue to live in this house,'' he said, adding, ''He wanted nothing other than to remain in this house for the rest of his life.'' Dr. Bartha was Romanian, and met his wife, Cordula Hahn, a native of the Netherlands, in 1973. He was studying medicine at the University of Rome, and she had just earned a doctorate in German literature. In 1974, they moved to the United States, and lived with Dr. Bartha's parents in Rego Park, Queens. Ms. Hahn took a job in the cultural section with the Netherlands Consulate General in New York while he studied for and passed exams enabling him to practice medicine in the United States. The couple were married early in 1977 and soon after had two daughters, Serena and Johanna. His wife stayed home to raise the children while he worked in hospital emergency rooms, where he developed a reputation for being a dour man with a gruff bedside manner. ''He only talked about work, a workaholic doctor,'' said Dr. Paul Mantia, who shared an office with Dr. Bartha. In 1980, Dr. Bartha first saw what would prove to be the love of his life, the four-story town house at 34 East 62nd Street, between Park and Madison Avenues. According to divorce papers, he and his parents, Ethel and John Bartha, bought the house for $395,000, after cobbling together $199,699 in cash. Dr. Bartha, his young family and his parents moved into the house in 1986. Dr. Bartha's joy over the purchase was intense and immediate, Mr. Garr said. For him, it symbolized validation, proof of success. ''He told me, 'I stood at the corner of 59th Street and Fifth Avenue and looked north, and said, ''This is it. This is where I want to live the rest of my life,'' ' '' Mr. Garr said. Dr. Bartha may have found his dream house, but his home life was far from idyllic. As he worked, he grew increasingly estranged from his wife and daughters, his lawyer said. Silence pervaded the home. ''There was two years of noncommunication,'' Mr. Garr said. ''They were like two ships in the night.'' In October 2001, his wife, who has resumed the use of her family name, filed for divorce and moved with her daughters to a small apartment in Washington Heights. The divorce papers described a bizarre, markedly unhappy home life. Dr. Bartha put up ''swastika-adorned articles'' around the house, according to a court decision, ''intentionally traumatizing'' her because she is of Jewish descent and was born in ''Nazi-occupied'' Holland. Dr. Bartha became enraged when she took them down, according to the papers, which also said he ignored his wife as she was treated for breast cancer. A judge granted her the divorce. He was ordered to pay $1.23 million, plus alimony of $2,000 per month for three years. But the referee in the case held that the couple's home, then valued at $5 million, was not marital property and that Ms. Hahn had no claim to the home. Then Dr. Bartha appealed the decision, a move that would ultimately cost him his house. He wanted to stay married, and would have had to sell or mortgage the house to pay the $1.2 million the court said he owed. ''He didn't love her,'' Mr. Garr said. ''He was emotionally and constitutionally opposed to divorce. He was a man who worked all the time and couldn't stand being alone.'' Early in 2005, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court held that the town house was marital property. It was an unusual decision that the New York Law Journal noted on its front page, partly because the appellate court determined that the home was community property ''regardless of the form in which the title is held.'' After the decision, Mr. Garr tried repeatedly to contact his client through letters and phone calls but failed ''He disappeared,'' Mr. Garr said. Steadily, Dr. Bartha seemed to be swallowed by his own despondency. He had already begun a series of suicide attempts, according to an official, who would not speak for attribution because the investigation is under way. In one instance, three or four years ago, the official said, Dr. Bartha barricaded himself inside his office and filled it with insecticide, and his secretary found him after breaking down the door. Once, within the last year, his partner found him in the basement, passed out with the gas on, the official said. Finally, Dr. Bartha's beloved town house slipped from his grasp. In August 2005, Ms. Hahn received a judgment of $3.6 million, plus a property credit and lawyer's fees, according to court papers. The total of all money judgments in the matrimonial action against Dr. Bartha came to more than $4 million. Ms. Hahn had complained in court papers that he ''has fought me every step of the way in the divorce action,'' and said she did not expect that he would satisfy the money judgments. The only way to ensure that he complied, she said, was to have the house sold. ''I have no doubt that respondent will ensconce himself in the marital residence and refuse to leave it after the auction is held,'' she said. ''He has said many times that he intends to 'die in my house.' '' In April this year, Justice Joan B. Lobis of State Supreme Court ordered that his 75 percent interest in the house be sold at auction. The court also ordered that the sheriff evict him from the house no more than 10 days after the auction, and that the sheriff remove three pieces of property -- two antique armoires and an antique desk -- and turn it over to Ms. Hahn. The furniture belonged to her family, according to the order. On Friday, a sheriff's deputy arrived at the house with eviction papers, said Dr. Mantia, who shared his office. If Dr. Bartha was upset, he did not show it, Dr. Mantia said. ''He's been up and down for two years since this divorce started,'' Dr. Mantia said. ''Sure, he was trying to commit suicide.'' BUILDING EXPLOSION IN MANHATTAN: THE DOCTOR"
"The four-story Upper East Side town house that was destroyed in a gas explosion yesterday once served as a clandestine meeting place for a circle of prominent New Yorkers who informally gathered intelligence for President Franklin D. Roosevelt before and during World War II, according to several published histories. Known simply as ''the Room,'' the covert network held monthly meetings to exchange gossip and tips in a bland rented apartment in the building at 34 East 62nd Street, as early as 1927. No one lived in the apartment, and the phone number was unlisted. It is not clear where the apartment was in the building, which was completed in 1882. The meetings apparently continued until the early 1940's. ''I'm amazed,'' Phillip Knightley, a historian who has studied the group, said in a phone interview from London yesterday after being told of the building's collapse. ''It's just intriguing that a place would be blown up that has such a connection to the birth of American intelligence.'' The existence of the Room was discussed in a 1981 scholarly article by Jeffrey M. Dorwart, an expert on naval intelligence and a historian at Rutgers University in Camden, N.J. Several subsequent histories have cited the article. The covert group, founded in 1917, included the real estate heir Vincent Astor, a close friend of Roosevelt; the book publisher Nelson Doubleday; Winthrop W. Aldrich, the president of the Chase National Bank; Kermit Roosevelt, a son of Theodore Roosevelt; David K. E. Bruce, a son-in-law of Andrew W. Mellon and a future ambassador to France, West Germany and Britain; the philanthropist William Rhinelander Stewart; and Marshall Field III, a newspaper publisher and heir to the Chicago department store fortune. Members of the Room, which had close ties with Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, reported on their conversations with world leaders and gathered to hear speakers like the polar explorer Richard E. Byrd and the writer W. Somerset Maugham, who had been a secret agent in World War I. ''With their love of secrecy, shared confidences, and clandestine trappings, the Room might easily be dismissed as dilettante amateurs, grown men enjoying boys' games of secret codes and invisible inks,'' Joseph E. Persico wrote in ''Roosevelt's Secret War: F.D.R. and World War II Espionage'' (Random House, 2001). ''To an extent this impression was accurate,'' the book continues. ''Yet, their elevated professional and social positions did place valuable intelligence at their fingertips.'' After World War II began in Europe in 1939, the group shifted its efforts to counterespionage; at President Roosevelt's request, it drew up plans to guard arms factories against sabotage and tighten border controls to prevent foreign spies from entering the United States, according to Mr. Knightley's ''Second Oldest Profession: Spies and Spying in the 20th Century'' (Norton, 1987). The Room used its contacts to examine bank accounts suspected of being used by foreign spies; monitor Japanese naval activities in the South Pacific; and report on conditions in the Canal Zone, the Caribbean and Peru. The group was eventually supplanted by the more formal intelligence-gathering efforts that resulted in the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1947. BUILDING EXPLOSION IN MANHATTAN: THE BUILDING"
"A gas explosion destroyed a four-story town house on the Upper East Side yesterday morning, and law enforcement officials said they were investigating whether the thunderous blast was a bizarre last chapter in a divorce battle over who would end up owning the building. Chunks of flying plaster and shards of glass injured four people walking along the street outside as the house collapsed in a cloud of dust and smoke that hung over the skyline. Ten firefighters were also hurt, as was the husband in the divorce case, identified by the police as Dr. Nicholas Bartha, a 66-year-old internist who lived in the building and had his office there. ''We just heard a boom, and everything shook, and we ran,'' said William Montanez, a doorman at the apartment house next door. ''It was chaos.'' The blast turned East 62nd Street, between Madison and Park Avenues, from a well-heeled oasis into an urban inferno, with television-news helicopters zooming in from above. Until the explosion jolted doormen and blew out windows, the street was a tree-lined block with a private club, a private school and the kind of storied history that included serving as a longtime meeting place for a secretive group of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's confidants. But yesterday, shortly before 9 a.m., as the power-breakfast crowd was sitting down around the corner at the Regency Hotel and Madison Avenue stores like Herm√®s and Luca Luca were preparing to open, a rumble came from inside the town house. At the Regency, late sleepers from out of town bounced in their beds, wondering if they had been awakened by an earthquake. In a sign of the concern the blast generated, the first official word came from the White House, which announced that it did not appear to have been the work of terrorists. And detectives began piecing together a New York story of real estate and divorce, anger and money -- and a house valued at $6.4 million. Law enforcement officials said the explosion rocked the neighborhood less than two hours after Dr. Bartha had addressed a disjointed, erratically punctuated e-mail message to his former wife, Cordula, with copies sent to Gov. George E. Pataki and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, and to the Fox News personalities Sean Hannity and Brit Hume, among others. In the message, he told her: ''You always wanted me to sell the house. I always told you, 'I will leave the house only if I am dead' You ridiculed me. You should have taken it seriously.'' He also wrote, ''When you read this lines your life will change forever. You deserve it. You will be transformed from gold digger to ash and rubbish digger.'' He sent the message at 7:30 a.m. Twenty-one minutes later, Con Edison received a call from employees of the private club next door, the Links Club -- organized early in the 20th century to promote golf -- saying they smelled gas. Michael S. Clendenin, a spokesman for Con Edison, said it sent a mechanic, who arrived at 8:20. Mr. Clendenin said the mechanic called in at 8:45 to report the explosion. The mechanic was not injured. Dr. Bartha, trapped in the rubble, spoke by phone to rescuers, who pulled him out. He had second- and third-degree burns over 30 percent of his body, one law enforcement official said. Late yesterday, as wisps of smoke billowed from the town house's smoldering remains, heavy machinery was used to remove the rubble, which dump trucks carted away. Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's deputy commissioner for public information, said the blast was being investigated as a crime, but that Dr. Bartha's condition was so serious that detectives had not been able to talk with him. Possible charges could include anything from reckless endangerment to assault because of the injuries sustained by the passers-by and by the firefighters. All those injured were taken to NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital. By the end of the day yesterday, fire marshals and detectives from the Police Department's arson and explosion squad were trying to piece together what had happened. One law enforcement official said detectives were investigating the possibility that Dr. Bartha had wanted to kill himself and blow up the building, but added: ''Do we have him turning that gas on and lighting a match? No.'' Another law enforcement official said, ''He's been depressed,'' noting that court filings and hearings involving the divorce case had been going on since 2001. Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing. As part of the settlement, a judge ordered Dr. Bartha to auction off the building and divide the proceeds with his wife. On Friday, a sheriff's deputy arrived at Dr. Bartha's with eviction papers, said Dr. Paul Mantia, whose office was in the same building. In one court ruling, Justice David B. Saxe of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court said that ''this was not a case of ordinary marital dissatisfaction or even 'riotous quarrels.' '' The judge said Dr. Bartha had ''intentionally traumatized'' his wife, ''a woman of Jewish origin born in Nazi-occupied Holland, with swastika-adorned articles and notes affixed around their home.'' Dr. Bartha, the judge said, ''also ignored her need for support and assistance while she was undergoing surgery and treatment for breast cancer.'' Dr. Bartha had tried to kill himself several times as the divorce proceeding worked its way through the legal system, the law enforcement official said. But some of his patients said he had complained of a gas odor in the last few weeks. Ladan Anavim, a patient who works in a nearby eye-care store, said Con Edison workers were in his office when she went for an appointment two weeks ago. ''The secretary told me they were smelling gas recently,'' she said. Ms. Anavim said Dr. Bartha seemed intent on finding the source of the gas odor. ''He was concerned about it to the extent that he left a patient'' to talk to the Con Edison workers in the basement, she said. A gas leak was reported on June 8 by a meter reader who smelled it, said Mr. Clendenin, the Con Edison spokesman. A Con Edison crew found the source of the leak, shut off the gas and fixed the problem. As Justice Saxe noted in his decision, Mr. Bartha's ex-wife moved to an apartment in Washington Heights with the couple's two adult daughters. A friend of the family came out of the building yesterday evening and read a statement from the ex-wife's lawyers. ''The emotional turmoil wrought by the parties' divorce proceedings capped by this unspeakable tragedy is difficult enough to bear,'' the statement said. ''They wish the best for Dr. Bartha in his recovery,'' it added. A spokeswoman for the New York City Department of Buildings, Jennifer Givner, said an initial inspection by department officials yesterday did not indicate structural damage to the two adjoining buildings, the Links Club and the apartment house. But the department ordered both buildings vacated either in part or in full, she said. The house itself is in the Upper East Side Historic District and was completed in 1882, built by L. D. Russell and J. B. Wray, architects and builders who worked on the Upper East Side. The city's Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building a landmark in 1981. Seri Worden, the executive director of the Friends of the Upper East Side Historic Districts, a preservation group, said the house was unusual because it ''had not been changed much at all.'' Dr. Bartha's ex-wife and his real estate agent, Mark Baum, contacted the police after they learned of the explosion and said, according to the law enforcement official, that ''they were concerned it may be him because of the e-mail.'' Mr. Baum said in an interview that Dr. Bartha ''might have been a little despondent over the divorce.'' This is not the first time an accusation of blowing up a building has come amid a messy romantic split. In 2004, an administrative law judge was convicted of causing a gas explosion that blew up his Stuyvesant Town apartment, injuring eight people and damaging the apartment next door, in a botched suicide attempt in the midst of a split from his partner. BUILDING EXPLOSION IN MANHATTAN: OVERVIEW Correction: July 14, 2006, Friday Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Tuesday about the gas explosion of a town house on the Upper East Side of Manhattan referred incorrectly to the rescue of the home's owner, Nicholas Bartha. He did not speak to rescuers by phone while trapped in the rubble."
"When the Upper East Side erupts into emergency, it sometimes looks like this. The fire trucks are parked outside the Herm√®s store, and the police tape cordons off an exclusive French cafe. A liveried doorman snaps a picture of the mayhem with his cellphone. A man stands beside him. He is carrying a Westie and wears a pale pink shirt. Such was a flavor of the strange scene that erupted yesterday when a four-story building on 62nd Street off Madison Avenue exploded and collapsed. On a block where an Auchincloss resides, where the actress Ellen Barkin once lived, and where Ronald Perelman keeps an office, were firefighters and emergency officials. The gawking crowd included waiters, Frenchmen and a few grandes dames in sunhats. There was Larry King, in for a few days from Los Angeles, mingling in tennis shoes and blue jeans with the journalists on the street. The destruction turned the block into a disaster zone. A front-end loader stood outside the Via Spiga shoe store. The Links Club, where the business set sips cocktails, was encased in heavy smoke. Scores of reporters jostled for comments and photographs. Meanwhile, witnesses told of a quiet morning rocked by unexpected chaos. ''It was just a loud boom,'' said Randy Roig, a doorman at the Cumberland House, an apartment building at 30 East 62nd, beside the ruined structure. ''It really shook us back. It was a little like a slow-motion effect.'' Mr. Roig said he helped about 200 residents leave the Cumberland, some of whom had called down to the lobby to ask what all the ruckus was about. It is a 16-story building with a penthouse, he said, adding that there would have been far more evacuees had most residents not been on vacation. The Cumberland bore the brunt of the explosion, as windows shattered and rooms filled up with smoke. ''The doors flew open like we had opened them ourselves,'' said William Montanez, another doorman at the Cumberland. ''We just heard a boom, and everything shook and we ran.'' Rabbi Yaakov Kermaier of the Fifth Avenue Synagogue, who lives with his family in the Cumberland, said he was standing across the street, waiting for the light to change, when the blast shook the block. His wife was at a different corner with their children, he said, and he yelled out to them to run. Then his wife yelled back: ''The baby is inside.'' Rabbi Kermaier, 36, went running back to the couple's second-floor apartment, thinking, ''I've got to get there as fast as I can,'' he said. ''I saw things flying around,'' he said. ''It was a sudden, deafening boom, then smoke and fire. I went running through the smoke and got the baby and the nanny out.'' Ten firefighters and five civilians were injured, including a doctor, Nicholas Bartha, who owned the destroyed building. Most of the civilians were passers-by on their way to work. Alfred Berger, 92, who lives on the 15th floor of the Cumberland, said that when he heard the explosion, he thought it was a bomb. Smoke began to pour in through his windows. ''It was like London after the raids,'' he said. ''I heard fire alarms going off throughout the building.'' Alan Rogers, 32, has a real estate office on the ground floor of the Cumberland. When the explosion occurred, he was in the middle of writing a check. ''It blew out the windows, and debris piled in,'' he said. He ran outside and saw people with blood all over them. ''They were very dazed.'' Karen Morris, a home-aid attendant who works across Madison Avenue from the collapsed building, said she ran down to the street the moment she heard the blast. She found a woman sitting on the sidewalk. There were shards of glass puncturing the left side of her body and strewn throughout her hair. ''She got the blast of the window,'' Ms. Morris said. ''It was like all these mini-cuts with splinters of glass.'' BUILDING EXPLOSION IN MANHATTAN: THE SCENE"
"Dr. Nicholas Bartha may have wanted to die in the explosion of his Manhattan town house yesterday morning, but by the time firefighters arrived, he was screaming for his life, the authorities say. ''Can you help me?'' the injured internist yelled repeatedly to firefighters as he lay in a small basement room miraculously shielded from the wreckage of his four-story landmarked town house at 34 East 62nd Street. ''Can you help me?'' The two firefighters who rescued him, Charles Wiemann and Richard Schmidt of Rescue 4 in Queens, said they managed to crawl through the smoky wreckage and pull the doctor out of his collapsed building, from which he was taken to NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital and listed in critical condition. Dr. Bartha was saved by a combination of luck and two veteran firefighters who found him threatened by flames in a small room that, unlike everything around it, had not been crushed by tons of wood and other debris. While other firefighters held off the fire with their hoses, the two firefighters held a breathing mask to the doctor's face, giving him air until he could be lifted out on a stretcher. Minutes after 8:45 a.m., when the building collapsed from what the authorities say was a gas explosion, the call arrived at Rescue 4's firehouse on Queens Boulevard in Woodside. When the company got to Manhattan after battling rush-hour traffic, it found Dr. Bartha's building fully engaged in flame and the doctor trapped. A second unit, Rescue 1, tried to enter the wreckage from the rear, as firefighters cleared debris from the front of the building so they could shut off the gas. A carbon monoxide meter was lowered into the debris to make sure that toxic gas would not block a rescue, and to determine if it was possible for anyone to be alive, Firefighter Schmidt said. Lt. Luis Torres of Rescue 4 had designated Firefighter Schmidt, a 15-year veteran, to serve as Entry 1, or the first man into a rescue situation, and Firefighter Wiemann as Entry 2. Firefighter Schmidt yelled into the wreckage. He thought he heard a faint response above the noise of the hoses, the sirens and the yelling, he said. ''We had reports of multiple people trapped, but nothing confirmed,'' he said. ''I thought I heard something, but I wasn't sure.'' The rescue crew told firefighters to turn off the hoses momentarily, and Firefighter Schmidt yelled again, ''Is anybody down there?'' Hearing something, he told Lt. Torres he was going in, and began squeezing his way through gaps in the debris. Now the voice grew louder, repeating, ''Can you help me?'' Someone had survived the destruction, and Firefighter Schmidt radioed a signal that there was a live person down there. Following the voice through the smoke, he found Dr. Bartha in a basement storage room directly below the concrete floor of the front foyer, the only part of the ground floor that had not collapsed, he said. The doctor was trapped inside but could be seen through the door's small window. The firefighter shone his flashlight on him. ''He was all burned up pretty bad,'' said the firefighter, who was able to give the doctor his own mask, which was attached to a tank of compressed air known as a Fast Pack. Then Firefighter Wiemann came down and they blasted a hinge off the door, pushing it aside to reach the doctor, whom they lashed to an aluminum backboard. Other firefighters avoided spraying water in that area, to avoid flooding the rescuers, Firefighter Schmidt said, ''but a few times the fire lit up over our heads and they had to knock it down with the hoses while we worked on him.'' Fearing additional collapses, they raced to get the doctor out. ''It wasn't a good place to be,'' said Firefighter Schmidt, who was assured by Dr. Bartha that no one else had been in the building when it exploded. Then the doctor was slowly passed up and out of the wreckage. ''He was 350 pounds, easy,'' Firefighter Schmidt said. As they worked on him, Dr. Bartha said nothing about whether he had intentionally caused the explosion, the firefighters said. ''I did not converse with him,'' Firefighter Schmidt said. ''We put the face-piece on him, so he wasn't saying anything.'' BUILDING EXPLOSION IN MANHATTAN: THE RESCUE"
"YOU might think of it as a New York variation on the ''If a tree falls in the forest'' question. In this case: ''If a disturbed man upset about a nasty divorce fiddles with the gas line in his four-story brownstone and the building soon thereafter explodes, falling in a fiery heap on a deluxe Upper East Side block first thing on a Monday morning, does anybody pay much attention?'' In a sense, of course, the answer is yes, particularly for those who lived and worked on and around East 62nd between Madison and Park Avenues, where the blast felt like an earthquake, where firefighters almost outnumbered residents for a while and where Dr. Nicholas Bartha, the building's sole occupant and chief suspect as the cause of the explosion, was later pulled from the rubble in critical condition. But in another sense, the sad story of Dr. Bartha and the beloved brownstone he simply refused to leave is a perfect example of that brand of bizarre but discrete calamity that New York -- a city defined by looking ahead, almost never behind -- experiences, absorbs like a flare crashing back into the sun and then relegates to the category of curiosity, one not even curious enough to remain on the cover of the tabloids past Day Two or inspire flights of headline-writing brilliance. (The New York Post's ''Honey, I Blew Up the House'' was probably the best, containing as it did an implicit ho-hum.) ''It wasn't 17 seconds after it happened that people were talking about the worth of the lot -- this is New York,'' said Michael Gross, the author of ''740 Park: The Story of the World's Richest Apartment Building,'' published last year. He added: ''It was a long time before I even heard on the news whether the guy was alive or dead -- that seemed like the last thing anyone was thinking about. There were more important things, unfortunately.'' He added that perhaps the only truly compelling part of the story was that it happened in a place that has always supposedly been better insulated against catastrophe than most, the Upper East Side, specifically the Gold Coast enclave within it, from Fifth Avenue to Lexington Avenue and 59th Street to 96th Street. That insulation, and the neighborhood's gilded reputation, is what drew Mr. Bartha to the brownstone in the first place and seemed to fuel his obsession never to part with the house to settle divorce judgments. ''Behind the impenetrable limestone curtain the rich are very much like you and me but in many ways more gothic because all the drama, acrimony and pathos of their lives are magnified by money,'' Mr. Gross said. ''And for Dr. Bartha, moving to 62nd Street represented -- as every one of the newspapers has said -- his lifetime dream. And he obviously was bound and determined to go down with the ship.'' His story was one of those that, outside the city, especially on television and mostly because it happened in New York, played as a Grade A example of what newspaper reporters used to call a bacon-cooler. (Bacon on the fork, traveling from breakfast plate to mouth, is interrupted by an especially pause-worthy piece of news.) In the city where it happened, though, it seemed to have a fairly brief half-life, having nothing to do with terrorism and competing as it did with a crowded summer news cycle that has also included some random stabbings, two horrific auto crashes and a postal worker injured in the subway by a man wielding two stolen power saws -- stories that also seemed to play bigger outside the city than in it. By Thursday morning, most of the displaced residents had been repatriated to their apartments on 62nd Street, and an excavation machine with a clawlike scoop had already dug its way down to the house's foundation bricks. The operator inside the machine sat with his feet propped up and crossed, a cigarette drooping from his lip, as if he carted away collapsed brownstones between real jobs. All that remained of the house's four once-stately stories was a half-intact stoop, crowned by an ornamental metal door that opened onto thin air. Along the wall of the building that used to abut Dr. Bartha's brownstone, a strip of wood paneling that had run along the house's third-floor staircase still clung to the brick, a humble palimpsest of a whole life, or actually of several generations of them. The Herm√®s store on the corner of Madison had re-polished its show windows and fully returned to the business of selling $850 cashmere shawls. Inside the Design Within Reach furniture store directly across from the new gap in the block's facade, the front window was cracked, but inside, light jazz drowned out sounds of excavation and a woman was listening to a sales clerk extol the virtues of a $2,000 Dordoni desk. The sidewalk across from the building had been reopened that morning, and by lunchtime, a small crowd gathered to watch the creation of a vacant lot. But the crowd was smaller than the one that gathers around the Naked Cowboy in Times Square on most days. And most passers-by merely looked over as they sped down the block, some pausing in the midst of cellphone conversations to lift the phone and snap a quick shot of the scene to send to friends (probably ones who didn't live in New York). ''It really came down neat, didn't it?'' said one man in basketball shorts, who paused longer than most. ''Kind of like one of those controlled demolitions.'' A construction worker on the sidewalk tried mostly in vain to keep people from passing too close to the trucks where the scoop was depositing the remains of the house. Many ignored him and scooted by just a couple of feet from the deafening rain of debris, looking aggrieved. It brought to mind an image from E. B. White's famous essay ''Here Is New York,'' about the precise distance that he imagined as providing both the intimate connection and vast separation peculiar to big cities, especially New York: 18 inches, sufficient for everything but the worst, like 9/11, which everyone must feel. ''BETTER than most dense communities,'' White wrote of New York, ''it succeeds in insulating the individual (if he wants it, and almost everybody wants or needs it) against all enormous and violent and wonderful events that are taking place every minute.'' ''A man was killed by a falling cornice,'' he wrote, recounting a fresh headline from the New York of his day. ''I was not a party to the tragedy, and again the inches counted heavily.'' Accounting for inflation, maybe yesterday's falling cornice is today's falling town house. And for those who were not a party to its collapse -- eight million give or take -- the inches might as well have been as many miles. THE NATION"
"Sherry Miller Benbasat was not happy when she returned to her apartment on Thursday afternoon and found a shiny padlock on the door. Whoever installed the new lock had not given her the key. In the lobby she found Al Dieguez, the building's resident manager. ''Al,'' she asked, ''could I go up to my apartment?'' He shook his head. ''Nobody can go in,'' he said. She asked why not. ''The fire marshal, the Buildings Department,'' he said. ''Maybe next week.'' Mrs. Benbasat's apartment overlooked the town house on East 62nd Street that exploded on Monday. Six stories below her living room, the authorities say, an internist seething at a sheriff's order to sell the town house and give most of the money to his ex-wife had tampered with the gas line. Now, like the residents of 12 other apartments in her building that have been declared off limits, and like the rest of a block that was showered with masonry and soot, Mrs. Benbasat is discovering that the explosion was only the beginning of a draining and prolonged process to put the pieces of her life back together. There are blown-out windows to be replaced; they are boarded with plywood now. There are walls to be plastered and painted; smoke from the fire blackened them. There are floors to be cleaned, furniture to be replaced, insurance adjusters to deal with and other repairs to be made, once work crews can go in. And no one can say how long it will take for things to return to normal. How long before Joe Daquara, a doorman who has asthma, can stop wearing a face mask on the job. How long before the swarm of emergency cleanup workers go away and the parade of trucks hauling big Dumpsters comes to an end. How long before Mrs. Benbasat can go home again. How long before the lawsuits are filed and settled, because everyone expects lawsuits. Consider one situation that is somewhat similar: Three years after an administrative law judge blew up his apartment in Stuyvesant Town, two lawsuits against him remain unresolved. Already, there are signs that the bright spotlight on the neighborhood around the town house is dimming. East 62nd Street has been reopened to traffic, at least in the afternoon rush. The police barricades that kept pedestrians off the sidewalks have come down. But in Mrs. Benbasat's building -- Cumberland House, which for nearly 50 years was separated from the town house only by a driveway -- the cleanup looms. And so does the frustration, for the owners of the 84 apartments that residents have been allowed to return to, as well as the 13 that are padlocked and remain off-limits. ''It could be months before the building is back in shape,'' said James Savage, who lives in one of the padlocked apartments. ''I'm going to have to find temporary living quarters for the next year or so -- well, at least six months, I figure. It's going to be a very long process, and I guess it's still a crime scene, so they're still investigating, although I think we know who did it.'' The internist, Dr. Nicholas Bartha, was alone in the town house when it blew up early Monday morning. Firefighters pulled him from the wreckage and took him to New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital with second- and third-degree burns. The explosion also injured 10 firefighters and 5 passers-by. The only one hospitalized, also at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell, was Jennifer Panicali, 22, a Parks Department employee who was walking to work. She underwent surgery to remove glass and debris from more than 100 places on her body, fire officials said. Fire marshals dug through the wreckage during the week and removed a plastic tube that they had said had been used to tamper with the gas line. One law enforcement official said the investigation was continuing ''with an eye to charging'' Dr. Bartha, though the charges he might face have not been determined. Dr. Bartha remains in a coma that doctors induced to help his chances of recovery. How the property is disposed of remains to be seen. There was talk in the neighborhood about whether the lot would be more valuable without the town house than with it. Some neighbors wondered whether a week in the headlines would affect its value. Some remembered a town house three blocks away that had had a different kind of notoriety: it was the apparent prize for Sante and Kenneth Kimes, a mother-and-son team of con artists who were convicted of murdering the owner, Irene Silverman. Mrs. Silverman disappeared in 1998. The town house has changed hands twice and has been converted to condominiums, said James Rinzler of Dominion Management, who was involved in the conversion. He said that starting from scratch, as would be the case on East 62nd Street, would be easier than renovating, as was done at the Silverman house. And he had an estimate of how long construction would take, once it began. ''From the time a developer gets his hands on the lot, two years,'' he said, ''but I don't know when those two years will start.'' For now, then, there are the day-to-day inconveniences. ''No gas, no computer, no cable, no TV,'' said Jackie Marks, who lives in the apartment above Mrs. Benbasat's. The stores on the ground floor of the building, on the Madison Avenue side, have been hot. The air-conditioning unit that cooled them was on a ledge between the building and the town house, and was destroyed. Window air-conditioners were soon installed above the doors in some of the stores. Other store owners rigged up equipment to cool down the sales floors and keep them from smelling like their still-smoky basements. Costas Liagouris, the manager of the Church's shoe store, said the $25,000 cooling machine he had rented was a disappointment. ''The only thing that works is the temperature gauge,'' he said, wiping his forehead. He said it read 99 degrees in the morning. The store did not feel much cooler hours later. In the lobby, Mrs. Benbasat was upset at being told she could not go into her apartment. But she also talked about the various stages people had gone through since the explosion. ''There's immediate trauma,'' said Mrs. Benbasat, a designer who was picking up a roll of wallpaper that had been delivered there. ''That's giving way to the trauma of putting my life and my home back in order. Every day feels like the calm after the storm, but every day, there's something else to contend with.'' With her insurance company, she had arranged for a place to stay: one nearby hotel until Wednesday, another after that. She had stopped by earlier in the day with an insurance adjuster and had taken some clothes. But no one told her that the apartment would be locked. Harry Smith, the managing agent for the building, said the city had issued an order to vacate the 13 apartments until an engineer determined whether the building had suffered structural damage in the blast. He said he hoped to have an engineer's report ready this week so the vacate order could be lifted. Yesterday, thin vertical cracks could be seen in the wall of the building that had been just across a driveway from the town house site, running from just above the driveway to well above the first floor. Mr. Dieguez's own apartment, on the ground floor of the building, was not yet padlocked. Bricks and debris that had filled much of the apartment had already been carted away. ''It was pretty at one time,'' he said, as glass crunched underfoot. Correction: August 9, 2006, Wednesday An article in some copies on July 16 about neighbors whose apartments were damaged when the Upper East Side town house of Dr. Nicholas Bartha exploded misstated the number of passers-by injured. (The error was repeated in an article on July 17 about the death of the doctor, who was suspected of blowing up the building.) Four passers-by were hurt, not five."
"A suicide bomber exploded his car on the main street of this southern city on Sunday, narrowly missing the governor of Kandahar Province and a Canadian military convoy, but killing 4 civilians and wounding at least 12 others, officials said. The explosion was heard across town and stirred anger and fear once more in a city that has been shaken by violence for months. As the police cleared the wreckage of the suicide bomber's car, the owners and workers of a teahouse on the sidewalk beside it cursed the Taliban, the government, the United States-led coalition, former Afghan leaders, President Bush and Pakistan. ''They should get together and bring security,'' shouted one of the owners of the shop, Zamari, who, like many Afghans, uses only one name. ''We lost a dozen people.'' Three teahouse workers were missing, including two of Mr. Zamari's nephews, ages 15 and 12, and two more teenagers were wounded, relatives said. The teahouse, where local workers and visitors from out of town gather to drink milky tea in the mornings, looks on to the main street, just 200 yards from the governor's palace. It was busy at 9 a.m. when the bomber struck. So was the carpenter's shop next door, where workers and customers were standing on the broad sidewalk. Mangled bicycles were sprawled on the sidewalk after the blast, and shards of metal, broken glass and discarded shoes were scattered across the road. The teahouse's windows were blown out, and equipment in the front was smashed. A carpenter, Amanullah, 29, stood in a vest and burned trousers, taking a pull on a cigarette. His hair and eyelashes were singed from the heat of the blast. ''I was here working,'' he said, gesturing to the planks and sheets of wood on the sidewalk. ''A coalition convoy went by and there was a car driving fast and I thought, maybe he will crash and explode, and then he did. He was a young man, without a hat. He was on his own.'' Mr. Amanullah said he was looking for his friend, Abdul Rahman, who is also a carpenter. It turned out that Mr. Rahman was in the city hospital, badly burned with his head heavily bandaged, but alive. Three others, an elderly government worker, a 16-year-old boy who was crossing the road and a farmer who had been sitting in the teahouse, were heavily sedated with head wounds. An old man, his whole body burned, writhed in agony, the sedative not working. The Kandahar governor, Asadullah Khaled, said later that his bodyguards had spotted the speeding car and tried to block it from overtaking them. Apparently, it had been waiting in an alley and emerged as the convoy passed, a coalition statement said. Two vehicles in the convoy were slightly damaged, the statement said, but no coalition soldiers or government personnel were injured. Survivors and relatives blamed the Taliban for the attack, but also criticized the government for failing to protect them and the coalition for driving through the center of town, inviting attacks in populated areas. ''The Taliban are trying to do jihad, but they are not doing that,'' said Abdul Nafi Agha, 30, a customer at the teahouse who escaped injury, his hand shaking as he spoke. ''They are just killing innocent people. We don't want this government if they cannot bring security.'' The commander of the Canadian battle group in Kandahar Province, Lt. Col. Ian Hope, said in an interview on Sunday that he did not expect suicide bombings to stop anytime soon, and that they might even increase in the coming months as insurgents find it harder to operate against coalition and Afghan forces in rural areas. NATO to Double Troops in South KABUL, Afghanistan, June 4 (AP) -- NATO will double the number of soldiers in southern Afghanistan when it takes over security there from United States troops next month, seeking to quash the worst rebel violence since the Taliban's ouster, the NATO commander here said Sunday. The commander, Lt. Gen. David Richards, also said NATO troops would be more ''people friendly'' in an effort to win the support of the local population amid rising resentment over what many Afghans see as overly aggressive tactics by the separate coalition forces that are led by the United States. At a news conference in Kabul, General Richards, a British officer, said the number of troops in the region would increase from an average of about 3,000 in recent years to about 6,000 when NATO takes on responsibility for the volatile region in July."
"Almost 10 years after T.W.A. Flight 800 blew up off Long Island, aircraft fuel tanks remain vulnerable to explosions because the Federal Aviation Administration has not taken decisive action, the nation's chief aviation safety watchdog said on Thursday. The watchdog, Mark Rosenker, acting chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said, ''For every day we are out here and haven't done anything, we increase the risk of this type of accident happening again.'' The aviation administration says it has invented a technology to fix the problem, proposed a rule to require its use and laid out a schedule to eliminate the problem by 2014. The airlines, however, say the proposed solution is not necessary because other actions have minimized the risk. After the most expensive and exhaustive crash investigation in its history, the safety board determined that the crash of Flight 800 on July 17, 1996, was caused by the explosion of the center fuel tank. The board said it believed that the explosion was set off by an electrical spark but it could not identify its source. Potential sources of sparks continue to be identified, officials said. Mr. Rosenker said, the tank in the left wing of a Boeing 727 owned by Transmile Airlines exploded on the ground in Bangalore, India, on May 4, and a Boeing 737 owned by Thai Airways was destroyed at the terminal in Bangkok by an explosion of the center wing tank in March 2001. The F.A.A. demonstrated a device in December 2002 that could make nitrogen, an inert gas, using air from a plane's engines. The nitrogen could be pumped into all fuel tanks, eliminating the danger if sparks were present. In March, the agency published a draft rule that would require installation of this technology over seven years, but Mr. Rosenker pointed out that it did not cover wing tanks, where about half the explosions have occurred. The agency hopes to put the rule into effect by the end of this year. Airlines not complying in seven years would have to ground their planes. Mr. Rosenker said it would cost about $500,000 per plane, a price he called reasonable. At the Air Transport Association, the airline industry's main trade group, Basil J. Barimo, an operations expert, said the industry had reduced the risk sufficiently by inspecting old wiring and taking other steps to exclude sparks. Board experts said that since the crash of T.W.A. 800, the aviation agency had issued more than 100 orders to airlines to fix problems in fuel tanks that could cause explosions, and that two months ago, it found a new potential source of sparks: a screw that had come loose and lodged against a fuel pump. Robert L. Swaim, an engineer on the safety board's staff, said that the possibility of a loose screw had not occurred to engineers at the F.A.A. who performed an exhaustive review of tank safety after the Flight 800 explosion. Failure to account for ''simple human error,'' like not tightening a screw enough, meant that there were probably other potential ignition sources still to be discovered, Mr. Swaim said. Among the crashes of the 1990's, the Flight 800 crash, in which 230 people died, stands out because its causes have not been eliminated in other planes. In contrast, after a ValuJet DC9 crashed in the Everglades earlier in 1996, because of a fire in a cargo hold, the airlines installed fire detection systems to make a repetition unlikely. Two years earlier, after a Boeing 737 flown by USAir had crashed on approach to Pittsburgh International Airport, airlines changed their procedures, and the hardware in the rudder control mechanism, to prevent a recurrence. And when an inflight fire caused the crash of a Swissair MD-11 near Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1998, the F.A.A. required the replacement of an insulating material that was found to be flammable."
"An explosion and fire at Universal Form Clamp, near Chicago, injured one person and sent two firefighters and four others to hospitals. The cause was unknown. ERIC FERKENHOFF (NYT)"
"Three construction workers were killed and one was injured yesterday at an oil field in Raleigh, Miss., when two tanks exploded, a state official said. The blast ripped through the tops of the tanks, sending huge metal discs hundreds of feet, said the official, John R. Parker of the Mississippi Oil and Gas Board. Mr. Parker helped searchers recover debris at the scene. ''It was like tearing the top off a can of peanuts,'' he said. ''Only these were huge pieces of metal, maybe 12 to 14 foot in diameter and about 500 pounds each. One landed 300 feet away.'' The men who were killed were standing on a catwalk over the 400-barrel tanks when they ignited. Mr. Parker said that the cause was under investigation but that fumes may have built up in the tanks, which had contained small amounts of oil. Sparks from a welding torch being used on a third tank may have ignited the fumes, he added. Kody Scarbrough, 20, and Nicholas W. Pounds, 23, both of Foxworth, Miss., died at the scene. George B. Jefferson, 53, of Columbia, Miss., died at a hospital. Huey Duncan, 71, also of Columbia, who was hanging from a safety harness and welding on the side of a tank, survived. The men worked for Stringer's Oil Field Service in Columbia."
"A Palestinian woman was killed Wednesday in Gaza after a pair of Israeli missiles veered off target, one of them slamming into a house. It was the latest in a series of botched airstrikes that have killed at least a dozen Palestinian civilians in the past eight days. The attack, which was also reported to have wounded 13 people in the southern town of Khan Yunis, came a day after a missile killed three Palestinian children, whose bodies were paraded through the angry streets of Gaza on Wednesday before they were buried. The botched strikes have swelled into an early crisis for the new Israeli government, and particularly for Amir Peretz, the dovish defense minister who nonetheless has pledged a tough line on militants who have been firing homemade rockets from Gaza into Israel. Earlier in the day, before the latest strike, Mr. Peretz faced strong criticism in Parliament from leftist and Arab members, one of whom demanded his resignation over the civilian deaths. Another member, Yossi Beilin, leader of the left-wing Meretz Party, called for the government to ''immediately and unilaterally declare a complete cease-fire for a limited period during which the Palestinian factions' readiness to hold their fire will be examined.'' On Wednesday evening, Mr. Peretz, speaking at a forum, was handed a note informing him of the botched strike. The Israeli Ynet news agency reported that he lowered his head and said: ''These days are not simple for me. To my regret I am told that innocent people paid a heavy price for this harsh conflict.'' In recent weeks, the Israeli military and Palestinian militants have been locked in a struggle in Gaza, as Palestinian militants have fired off hundreds of homemade Qassam rockets and Israelis have responded with thousands of artillery shells and other attacks. Capt. Jacob Dallal, a military spokesman, said that on Wednesday the Israeli Air Force fired a pair of missiles at a car carrying militants on their way to carry out an unspecified attack. But for unknown technical reasons, he said, the missiles went off course. One hit the roof of a house and another hit the road. Palestinian news reports said a pregnant woman and several children were among the wounded. The occupants of the car were not hurt. ''We have to understand why the missiles went off course,'' Captain Dallal said. ''That is a serious technical issue we have to investigate to make sure it doesn't occur.'' He said the air force's record in hitting targets remained accurate over all, and he defended airstrikes as both precise and a better option than larger operations in Gaza. ''We have been using it for a long time, with a proven success rate both in targeting terrorists and in avoiding civilian casualties,'' he said. Human rights groups have criticized both sides -- the Palestinian militants for firing rockets into civilian areas, and the Israeli military for what the groups see as a disproportionate response that has not adequately safeguarded civilians. On Wednesday, a heated dispute continued over the most contentious incident in recent days, an explosion on a beach in Gaza on June 9 that killed eight civilians amid a barrage of Israeli fire from the air, land and sea. Palestinians and human rights groups blame the Israeli military, which has denied responsibility. On Wednesday, Maj. Gen. Meir Kalifi of Israel said tests on a piece of shrapnel extracted from one of the wounded showed that it did not come from an Israeli 155-millimeter shell, fired by Israelis that day. He did not rule out, however, that it could have been an Israeli shell fired earlier that did not explode, or that it could have been a bomb placed by Palestinian militants. ''Everything is being checked,'' he told reporters. A statement from Human Rights Watch, which investigated the site the day after the blast, accused the military of ignoring ''important evidence,'' including shrapnel it gathered from the beach suggesting it was an Israeli shell, and questioned the Israeli timeline of events. Israeli and Palestinian leaders on Wednesday addressed the larger political issues in the struggle here, though separately, at a high-powered conference for Nobel laureates, organized by Elie Wiesel, the novelist and winner of the 1986 Nobel peace prize, in Petra, Jordan. ''We cannot, cannot accept a unilateral solution,'' Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, insisted when asked about the plan by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel to pull out up to 80,000 Israeli settlers from the West Bank and establish Israel's borders along the route of Israel's separation barrier. ''We may not have the power to prevent this, but we have the will to say no,'' he added. ''They may impose, but it won't put an end to the conflict.'' Mr. Abbas is scheduled to meet Mr. Olmert on Thursday for the first time since he formally became Israel's prime minister last month. The meeting will be informal and in a group of eight people, including King Abdullah II of Jordan and Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who is also a Nobel peace laureate. Mr. Abbas acknowledged in an answer to Mr. Wiesel that he had a good knowledge of Jewish suffering and anxieties. ''But I also want them to know that I am also a victim, and maybe a victim of the victims,'' Mr. Abbas said. ''We have both suffered, and we should not increase the suffering of the other.''"
"An explosion tore through a rural Georgia motel Tuesday morning, killing at least one person and sending motel guests and employees fleeing. After more than nine hours of digging through broken concrete and twisted metal, search and rescue teams recovered a body they said had been ''burnt beyond recognition.'' Officials notified the family of a missing maintenance man who was believed to be at the motel at the time of the explosion but said they would not be able to make a positive identification for some time. ''We can't confirm race, gender or anything at this point,'' said Clark Farr, chief of the Bremen Fire Department. Two men believed to be day laborers who may have been guests at the motel are also missing, but investigators are not sure the two men were even at the motel when the explosion occured. Family members of the missing motel employee, Reese Helton, said they believed he had been killed. All other employees and guests of the 73-room motel, the Great Western Inn in Bremen, were unharmed, Mr. Farr said. Shortly before 9 a.m., the back corner of the two-story motel exploded, causing the second story to buckle and crush the ground floor. That part of the motel, where Mr. Helton was believed to be working, housed a laundry room, gas lines and hot water tanks. ''Everybody screamed and tried to run, but it was too late,'' said Nancy McDaniel, 32, a first cousin of Mr. Helton, recounting what witnesses told her as she arrived at the motel soon after the explosion. ''They said everything that was on top was on top of him.'' Mr. Helton's extended family gathered in a grassy area next to the motel, waiting for word from rescuers. Around 1 p.m., his aunt, who had been taken closer to the scene by firefighters, returned to her family and said he had been killed. Ms. McDaniel covered her face with her hands and cried. ''I just had Father's Day dinner with him last Sunday,'' she said. Natural gas lines, cleaning chemicals and a propane tank were in the area of the explosion, but firefighters said they would not be able to determine the cause until they could investigate after clearing debris and stabilizing the structure, which collapsed further at least three times after the initial blast. Chief Alex S. Cohilas of the Clayton County Fire Department said that about 20 agencies -- including fire departments from several counties, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, state search and rescue teams, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives -- had been called to the scene."
"A powerful explosion ripped through an industrial plant near downtown Milwaukee on Wednesday morning, killing 3 people and injuring more than 40 others, the authorities said. Witnesses said the blast flipped cars upside down, sent plumes of black smoke into the air, rattled windows in downtown office buildings several blocks away and jolted morning commuters. Officials ruled out terrorism or foul play. The explosion was a ''tragic, accidental situation,'' the Milwaukee police chief, Nannette H. Hegerty, said at a news conference. By early afternoon, only a handful of smoldering hot spots remained from the blast, which occurred at 8 a.m. and drew more than 150 police officers, firefighters and hazardous-material crew members to the Falk Corporation's industrial complex west of downtown, said Lt. Brian O'Connor, a spokesman for the Milwaukee Fire Department. ''We have accounted for everybody the company knows was there,'' Lieutenant O'Connor said as emergency workers conducted a second sweep of the charred remains of the one-story, 150-foot-by-500-foot warehouse, which was leveled by the blast. Falk, a manufacturer of industrial gears whose roots in Milwaukee date back to the mid-19th century, is in a largely industrial area called the Menomonee Valley close to Miller Park, home of the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team. Local news reports quoted some Falk employees as saying they had been told of a gas leak just before the explosion, but neither Lieutenant O'Connor nor the spokeswoman for the Police Department, Anne E. Schwartz, would confirm those statements. They said the cause of the blast was under investigation. ''The propane tanks are still intact, so I would be surprised if it were the propane,'' Lieutenant O'Connor said. The roughly 500 employees on the scene at the time of the blast were taken to Miller Park. David L. Mays, 61, a Vietnam War veteran and a machinist for Falk, told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the blast knocked him to the ground and reminded him of ''an incoming mortar round.'' Fire officials conducted air quality tests and concluded that there was no risk to the public of chemical exposure. Further tests of air quality and water samples taken from the Milwaukee River will be analyzed this week for contaminants, the authorities said. Falk, which is owned by the Rexnord Corporation, has a clean safety record with the city, Ms. Schwartz said. The most recent inspection of its 10-building, 1.5-million-square-foot facility was in September."
"Three American soldiers were killed when a roadside bomb exploded under their vehicle as they drove through Baghdad on Saturday, the American military said Sunday, and officials said seven Iraqi police officers died Sunday when a suicide bomber attacked a police station in the city. The attack on the Iraqi police officers underscored the beleaguered security forces' struggle to devise a new plan to deal with the rampant killing. Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani, who oversees the police force, said 12,000 Iraqi police officers had been killed battling crime, militias and insurgents since the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Mr. Bolani said the new plan should be ready in the next few weeks. However, he also has to deal with widespread corruption and other problems inside the force itself. During a news conference Sunday, he said roughly 300 officers, of 188,000, had been removed from duty and were being investigated. Even as he described the government's new efforts, six mortar shells landed across the city, wounding 12 people, officials said. The three Americans killed by the roadside bomb were members of the 89th Military Police Brigade. The Associated Press reported that a soldier assigned to the Third Brigade Combat Team, First Cavalry Division, died Saturday in an explosion in Diyala, east of the Iraqi capital. Elsewhere, snipers attacked a joint American and Iraqi patrol in Baquba. The resulting exchange of gunfire left at least five people dead, officials said, though none were believed to be Americans. In the southern part of the country, skirmishes between Iraqi security forces and militia members in Samawa intensified. Militia fighters linked to the militant cleric Moktada al-Sadr fired rocket-propelled grenades at police headquarters and state buildings as the central government in Baghdad struggled to end the confrontation. Mr. Bolani, during his news conference, sought to play down the three days of clashes in Samawa, which is about 230 miles southeast of Baghdad He said he believed that the government's forces ''can face these outlaw groups.'' He refused to identify the groups, but the police said they were members of the Mahdi Army militia, which is controlled by Mr. Sadr. Local officials expressed fears that the clashes would expand to include Nasiriya Province, which is only 46 miles from Samawa. In nearby Diwaniya, police officials said, the local security forces were on a heightened state of alert. Elsewhere, the Iraqi security forces continued to come under attack as a suicide bomber killed seven police officers in Miqdadiya, 50 miles northeast of Baghdad, a police official said."
"Shootings and hidden bombs at a market, a gas station and an army recruiting center killed at least 52 Iraqis on Wednesday, continuing a wave of sectarian violence that has defied stepped-up efforts to halt its spread. In the deadliest attack, a bomb inside a vendor's cart exploded just after 10 a.m. in the Shorja market, Baghdad's oldest and largest bazaar, killing at least 24 civilians and wounding 35, Interior Ministry officials said. Earlier, just south of the capital, in Hilla, a bicycle rigged with explosives blew up near an army recruiting center, killing at least 12 people, the authorities said. A car bomb near a gas station in Baghdad also killed two civilians and wounded 21 people, including five policemen, who had rushed to the scene in response to a blast a few minutes earlier. Gunmen in Baghdad killed a senior Justice Ministry official, Nadiya Muhammad Hasan, her driver and a guard. The motive was unclear, but senior officials have frequently been targets of killings in recent months. The authorities also found 13 other bodies in various locations in the city. With at least 11 additional civilians killed throughout the country, the tally of Iraqis killed or found dead on Wednesday reached 65, according to Iraqi officials. The rash of attacks -- reflecting a spike in violence that has claimed roughly 200 lives since Sunday -- came despite a new security plan for the capital, on a day when the top United States general, George W. Casey Jr., in Iraq said Iraqi forces could take over security as early as next year. ''I don't have a date,'' General Casey said in Baghdad. ''But I can see -- over the next 12 to 18 months -- I can see the Iraqi security forces progressing to a point where they can take on the security responsibilities for the country, with very little coalition support.'' Three years into the war, American and Iraqi officials have grown increasingly eager to show progress. In recent weeks, they have repeatedly trumpeted evidence of a decline in killings this month after increases in June and July. Yet the bloodshed of the past few days suggests that the gains might be temporary. Americans have not been spared. The United States military said Wednesday that a marine from the First Armored Division was killed in action on Tuesday in Anbar Province. Military officials also said two American soldiers were killed in an attack on a Stryker vehicle on Sunday in western Baghdad, not four as it had reported earlier. The total number of American service members killed that day remained at nine, though. This month, 60 American service members have been killed in Iraq, up from 43 in July and nearly even with the 61 killed in June, according to Coalition Casualty Count, a Web site that tracks military fatalities. In all, more than 2,600 American men and women in uniform have been killed in Iraq since the start of the war, according to the Department of Defense. The toll for Iraqis is far higher, with an average of more than 100 killed a day in June and July by spreading sectarian violence, according to Iraqi government figures. Statistics for August have not been released, but the attack at the Shorja market was just the latest attack in a crowded area that seemed aimed at killing as many civilians as possible. The explosion destroyed scores of makeshift stalls, sent smoke towering over buildings and spread body parts through the streets. Ali Jasim, 47, a yogurt vendor at the market, said that he narrowly missed being killed and that two brothers of a restaurant owner and four cardamom vendors were among those killed. ''One of the women's sons was getting married tomorrow,'' he said. A few hours after the explosion, piles of debris had been swept to the curb. A funeral procession flowed through the street, carrying one of the victims of the bombing. Some of the mourners and bystanders blamed the United States, echoing a belief among some groups of Iraqis that the American government initiates the violence to justify its occupation. Others, like Raheem Kadem, 44, a high school gym teacher from Sadr City, a Shiite neighborhood, blamed Iraqi officials. ''Where is government?'' he asked. ''Why have the politicians left the people to face their destiny while the government hides behind the walls of the heavily protected Green Zone?'' ''Things are getting worse,'' he said. Iraq's defense minister, Abdul Qader Mohammed Jassim, met with the governor of Diwaniya and other local leaders in an effort to shore up support for the government after his troops clashed for 14 hours on Monday with Shiite militias. He announced that there would be a ban on weapons, though he offered no plan for enforcing it, and said that when rival Shiite factions had disputes with forces in the area, they should ask him to intervene. The battle was one of the worst internal conflicts in recent memory, pitting Iraqi troops against members of the Mahdi Army, loyal to the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, and other militias. The Iraqi police and army officials said Wednesday that the death toll from that battle had increased, to 23 soldiers and 13 civilians. General Casey said Iraqi forces ''gave much better than they got,'' but his assessment could not be verified. He said the clash was not a setback for the army and the government did not intend to back down. ''The battle may be over,'' he said. ''But the campaign to clean that city up and to restore it to Iraqi government control isn't finished.''"
"The explosion that awakened Muhammad Khaitan at dawn on Wednesday seemed sadly routine. The dust rising skyward a few blocks from his home suggested yet another attack on a police checkpoint. But for Mr. Khaitan, the target proved far more personal and depraved. Two bombs, witnesses said, shredded a memorial commemorating the death of his 14-year-old son and two dozen other children who were killed last summer when a car bomber sped into a crowd receiving candy from American troops. A monument to life -- a statue of debris from the attack set on a pedestal with the victims' names -- had become another casualty of what many here now consider an undeclared civil war. ''All they left was the foundation,'' said Mr. Khaitan, 41. ''They don't want the next generation to remember how we suffered.'' If grief comes in waves, the memorial's destruction clearly yanked Mr. Khaitan, like an undertow, back into the sorrows of the past. During an interview at a Baghdad hospital where he works as a medical assistant, his eyes glossed with tears. Though his boss looked on, he relived his past and current horror without being asked. ''I was at the market, shopping as usual,'' he said. ''And my son was with his uncle, my brother.'' Suddenly, he said, he heard an explosion. Sectarian violence had already started to erupt in the capital but his neighborhood of New Baghdad, a predominantly poor Shiite area to the south, still seemed safe. He didn't panic. ''When anything happens, we depend on God,'' he said. The calm quickly shattered. His aunt and a cousin ran to his car when he arrived home, frantically shouting. Mr. Khaitan's son, Saif Muhammad, and his best friend, Hassan Mujid, who lived with the family, had been injured, they said, and possibly killed in the blast. Not knowing if they were dead, ''I lost it,'' Mr. Khaitan said. He threw the bags of food in anger and rushed a few blocks away to where the attack occurred. Colored slippers, car parts and bloodied flesh covered the street. The bomber had used a sport utility vehicle, and the blast shattered the windows of several buildings. Mr. Khaitan discovered from neighbors that his brother had taken Saif to a local hospital. ''I tried to go,'' he said, widening his eyes to keep from crying, ''but I didn't get there in time.'' The doctors told him his son died minutes after the attack from two pieces of shrapnel that punctured his chest. Mr. Khaitan paused. Unlike many Iraqis who appear far older than their age, he looked young, in striped acid-washed jeans, with only a few strands of gray hair. Dr. Shaalan al-Abboudi, the director general of the hospital, Ibn Rushid, looked up and shuffled a few papers. He said another one of his employees had been missing for eight days, and appeared to have been kidnapped. Mr. Khaitan's tragedy, he said, was one of many among the hospital's staff members. ''I feel like his pain is my pain,'' Dr. Abboudi said. ''This is the life we live here. We must face it.'' Mr. Khaitan held up the cover of an old copy of a local newspaper showing snapshots of his son and the other children killed. They all smiled from within small circles that would fit in a locket. This, he said, was what the monument represented. He said he didn't know who the attackers might be, but he had his suspicions. ''All I can say is that the police checkpoint was only 150 meters away,'' he said. There was no anger in his voice. He said that he kept despair and vengeance at bay with the help of God. A few months ago, he said, he was saved from death while on his way to a funeral for an in-law. At a fake checkpoint run by insurgents, a man in a police uniform, in a moment of mercy, told him to flee. Minutes later, shots rang out. Mr. Khaitan said he trusted that it was God's will to protect his life and take his son's. In Iraq, he added, after so much war, how could anyone be surprised by death and destruction. ''It is the fate of humankind always to suffer,'' he said. ''Nothing happens without the order of God.'' THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: INSURGENCY"
"As American forces conducted a new security sweep in western Baghdad on Sunday, five apparently coordinated bombings in a predominantly Shiite neighborhood on the city's south side killed at least 57 people and wounded 148, an Iraqi government official said. The death toll could rise, the official said, as emergency workers searched for victims in the rubble of an apartment building that collapsed as a result of the bombings. The attacks, which killed civilians in a largely residential neighborhood, were the deadliest in the capital since the American military dispatched new forces here more than a week ago to quell a surge in killings and kidnappings by sectarian militias and criminal gangs. Also Sunday, American and Iraqi soldiers searching for people who had been kidnapped raided Iraq's Health Ministry early in the morning and arrested five bodyguards, military and government officials said. Southwest of the capital, security forces arrested 16 men who were suspected of planning to kidnap or kill members of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki's family, according to a statement from the prime minister's office. The five bombings in the Zafaraniya district of southern Baghdad occurred in two waves about an hour apart on Sunday evening, an Interior Ministry official said. At 7:30 p.m., the first of three successive blasts rocked an apartment building, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Shortly thereafter, in a market about 60 yards away, a car bomb detonated, killing people involved in rescuing victims of the first blast, the official said. The third explosion, minutes later, occurred on a road near the building as a police patrol sped toward the scene, the official said. Then, at 8:30 p.m., about 300 yards from the scene of the first three explosions, a bomb rigged to a motorcycle blew up after neighbors confronted its driver, who was trying to park on the street, the Interior Ministry official said. Two minutes later, the official added, a fifth bomb exploded near the wreckage left by the motorcycle bomb, killing bystanders. The new American-led security operation here is intended ''to reduce the level of murders, kidnappings, assassinations, terrorism and sectarian violence in northwest Baghdad and to reinforce the Iraqi government's control in Iraq's capital city,'' according to a statement released by the United States military on Sunday evening. The raid on the Health Ministry, which began around 2:30 a.m. following a tip from a local resident, did not turn up any kidnapping victims. It did draw a vehement reaction from the health minister, Dr. Ali al-Shimari, a Shiite who is closely aligned with Moktada al-Sadr, the anti-American cleric, and the powerful Shiite militia he commands, the Mahdi Army. ''They broke into all the floors, especially the ninth floor, stole some money, which was the salaries of the security workers, and they kidnapped five of our staff,'' Dr. Shimari, visibly annoyed, told reporters at his office Sunday afternoon. ''This is a provocation. No day passes by without raids by the Americans against our health institutions.'' A statement from the American military on Sunday evening said coalition forces received a tip at 12:44 a.m. Sunday that 15 men wearing Iraqi Army uniforms had kidnapped six people from a large medical complex in central Baghdad and taken them to the Health Ministry. American military officials did not respond to questions about whether soldiers took any money from Dr. Shimari's office, but they said the raid was part of the new American effort to stabilize Baghdad's precarious security situation. ''The Iraqi government has sworn to take every citizen's tip seriously and act upon them,'' said the military spokesman, Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, in an e-mail message. ''The coalition has likewise sworn to assist them in these efforts to build a secure environment. It is for the benefit of the Iraqi people that these forces conducted the search and detained the suspects.'' Dr. Shimari has gained the reputation as something of a Shiite firebrand. In June, he faced awkward questions after a Sunni Arab health official from a neighboring province disappeared after a meeting in Dr. Shimari's office. Some Sunni political leaders charged that the official, Dr. Ali al-Mahdawi, who is a member of the Iraqi Islamic Party, was kidnapped by members of a Shiite militia. Dr. Shimari has denied any knowledge of the disappearance of Dr. Mahdawi, whose fate remains unknown. The men suspected of plotting to kill or kidnap Prime Minister Maliki's family members were arrested in Hindiya, about 60 miles southwest of Baghdad, the statement from Mr. Maliki's office said. The men, whom the statement described as ''criminals,'' confessed to killings, abductions and an attack on a police station in Mahmudiya that killed six officers, the statement said. One suspect in the group also confessed to detonating 12 car bombs in Baghdad, it said. The government did not identify the 16 men or clarify which killings and kidnappings the men had confessed to. In the northern city of Mosul, Duraid Kashmoula, the governor of Nineveh Province, barely escaped assassination after gunmen fired at his convoy with machine guns, an official in the governor's office said. A member of the governor's security detail was wounded in the attack. Also Sunday, American military officials said that soldiers from the 502nd Infantry, 101st Airborne Division, had arrested a man on Thursday who was involved in a marketplace bombing in Mahmudiya, south of Baghdad, on July 17 that killed 40 people and wounded 70 others."
"A blast in the center of Antalya, a popular resort town on Turkey's Mediterranean coast, killed three people and wounded 20 on Monday. Three explosions in another popular tourist destination on Sunday injured 21 people, including 10 Britons. The Kurdistan Liberation Hawks, a hard-line separatist group linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, claimed responsibility for the bomb attacks in the coastal resort of Marmaris on Sunday and for another blast in Istanbul the same day that wounded six people, according to a statement on its Web site on Monday. Also Monday, the Anatolian news agency reported that the authorities had detained a member of the Kurdistan Workers Party suspected of planning a bombing in Izmir. The explosion on Monday in Antalya, known as the capital of Turkish tourism on the Mediterranean, took place in front of the Municipality Business Center an hour before it closed, which one government official who worked in the building said prevented a major disaster by avoiding the commuter rush. ''The blast was so powerful that it broke all our windows,'' said the man. ''The death toll could have been much higher if it had been delayed a bit more because this area is really a very busy one.'' A few hours after the attack, a security forces spokesman in Antalya said the police had developed rough sketches of two suspects and located the spot where the blast originated. In Marmaris, the police detained one suspect in connection with the bombings on Sunday but did not disclose his identity or any possible links with an illegal group. Eleven of the 21 local residents wounded in the blast were discharged from the hospital, while the 10 Britons remained hospitalized, including two in intensive care. The Britons were members of two families vacationing in town, according to Tayfun Sentop, the general manager of the Ahu Hetman Hospital. ''The two British nationals are being kept under intensive care not because they are in critical condition, but because they need extra attention for the treatment of their burns,'' he said. ''Other family members are well enough to leave, but we didn't want to separate them from each other and are putting them all up at our hospital for now.'' The first explosion in Marmaris took place just before midnight Sunday in a minibus that carried tourists from a nearby beach to the town center. The next two blasts were from explosives left in garbage cans in two town districts, security officials said. The armed conflict between Kurdish separatists and the Turkish Army has claimed more than 30,000 lives since the early 1980's."
"A belt packed with explosives worn by a man who apparently intended to blow himself up inside one of the holiest shrines of Shiite Islam exploded on Thursday during a police pat down at a checkpoint near the shrine, Iraqi officials said. At least 35 people were killed and more than 120 others were wounded, including Iranian pilgrims, the officials said. The blast, in Najaf, 100 miles south of Baghdad, ripped into a crowd of Shiite pilgrims who had traveled to the golden-domed Shrine of Imam Ali on the anniversary of the death of Zaineb, the granddaughter of the Prophet Muhammad. The bombing of a Shiite shrine in the city of Samarra in February set off a wave of revenge attacks on Sunni Arabs and counterattacks on Shiites in which hundreds of people were killed within days. The explosion on Thursday underscored the degradation of security in the spiritual heart of the Shiite-dominated south, an area once believed to be under the tight control of Iraqi and American forces. The most revered Shiite cleric in Iraq, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, lives just blocks away from the shrine. Other attacks around Iraq, mostly aimed at civilians, brought the death toll for the day to at least 48, even as additional Iraqi and American troops continued to deploy across Baghdad to try to bring a modicum of security to the capital. The shrine attacked in Najaf sits at the center of downtown, surrounded by a labyrinth of narrow alleyways, and is a memorial to Ali, the prophet's son-in-law and the first martyr in the epochal seventh-century split between Sunni and Shiite Islam. The bomber walked up to a police checkpoint about 60 feet from the shrine at 10:15 a.m. and his explosives detonated as a policeman searched his body, said local officials and the Iraqi prime minister's office. A ball of flame engulfed the police officers at the checkpoint, killing at least five of them, said Dr. Munthir al-Athari, director of the health bureau in Najaf. At least eight women were among the dead. The shrine was apparently not damaged. Policemen and rescue workers wheeled victims sliced with shrapnel into the city's main hospital. Women in black robes wailed. People sprawled across beds and clutched limbs swathed in bandages soaked through with blood. ''I was in the market heading to visit the shrine when a huge explosion took place,'' said Shakir Ubaid Hassan, who was among those being treated for wounds. ''A lot of people were killed and injured, and I was hit in my head.'' The country's top leaders, including the president and the prime minister, denounced the assault in separate statements. Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, a staunch Shiite, pinned the blame on loyalists of Saddam Hussein and ''takfiris,'' a term that refers to fundamentalist Sunni Arabs who consider Shiites to be infidels. ''Such barbaric carnage reveals the nature of the Saddamists and takfiri terrorists who seek to start sectarian unrest between Iraqi people,'' Mr. Maliki said in a written statement. ''We ask God Almighty to take the martyrs into his heaven and grant patience to their families and heal the wounded.'' Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, a spokesman for the American command, issued a statement saying the attack was the work of ''a vicious death squad who targeted innocent Iraqis practicing their faith at one of the holiest sites in Iraq.'' Najaf's economic growth is dependent on a steady stream of religious tourists, including many from neighboring Iran. Under Mr. Hussein's rule, few Shiites from outside Iraq were allowed to make pilgrimages to the Shrine of Ali. Now, thousands stream into the city each day, Iraqi officials said. Powerful Shiite parties with militias have control of the security forces in the province encompassing Najaf, and the area was once considered a haven shielded from the incessant bombings that plague central Iraq. But a recent series of deadly attacks has eroded the sense of security. On July 18, a suicide bomber in a van set off his explosives after luring day laborers into his vehicle outside a Shiite shrine in the neighboring city of Kufa, killing at least 53 people and wounding more than 100. On July 6, a suicide car bomber rammed his sedan into two busloads of Iranian pilgrims near another Shiite shrine in Kufa, killing at least 12 people, including 5 Iranians, and wounding dozens. The bombings in Kufa seemed intended to provoke the militant Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, whose militia is accused by American officials and many Sunni Arabs of killing Sunnis in attacks across Baghdad and elsewhere. Mr. Sadr's chief mosque is in Kufa, and he occasionally preaches there on Fridays. Mr. Sadr's main office is next to the Shrine of Ali in Najaf, as are those of some of the country's leading ayatollahs. The city is home to the marjaiya, considered by many Shiites to be the top four clerics of their faith, and the base for the Hawza, a venerable seminary. Prominent Shiites have lived or studied in Najaf, including Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, and Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah in Lebanon. The governor of Najaf, Assad Abu Ghalal al-Taiee, belongs to one of the country's leading Shiite parties, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq. The party has a military wing, the Badr Organization, that helps provide security for Najaf. Other militias also operate openly in the city, including that of Mr. Sadr. The Shiite movement began in earnest when Ali and his son Hussein were killed in separate incidents in the seventh century. The term Shiites originally meant partisans of Ali. Shiites have clung to the notion that those directly descended from Ali, and thus from the Prophet Muhammad, are the proper rulers of the Islamic empire. Ali's body is said to lie in a tomb inside the shrine, which Mr. Sadr's militia used as a base during battles against American forces in 2004. The other reported violence on Thursday unfolded mostly in Baghdad. Four civilians were killed when the Sadr militia clashed with other armed men, Iraqi officials said. A bomb exploded in a restaurant, killing at least six people and wounding three. Three people were killed and three wounded when Iraqi commandos fought gunmen near a bazaar."
"A series of explosions struck in and near the largest mosque in a flashpoint textile town in western India on Friday, killing more than two dozen people, wounding more than 100 and raising the specter of renewed sectarian clashes. The police said there were three explosions, two inside the mosque compound and one nearby, in Malegaon, a city of about 500,000 with a history of Hindu-Muslim violence, about 160 miles north of Mumbai, the financial capital. The mosque is also home to one of the largest Muslim cemeteries in the area, local residents said, and the blasts struck shortly after unusually crowded Friday Prayer, as worshipers prepared graves to honor the dead on the Shab-e-Barat holiday. Speaking to reporters here in the capital, Home Minister Shivraj Patil called the explosions a ''terrorist'' attack intended to provoke a clash between ''different sections of society.'' The country has suffered a spate of terrorist attacks in recent years, including the July 7 commuter train bombings in Mumbai, which the authorities have attributed to Islamist militants setting up so-called sleeper cells across the country. The bombings on Friday were unusual in that they seemed to be directed at a heavily Muslim area. No one claimed responsibility and the authorities declined to speculate on who could be responsible. The attacks came three days after what now sounds like a prophetic warning from the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, about the many-headed specter of violence threatening his country. ''We confront a wide array of complex internal security problems and threats,'' he told a meeting of chief ministers on Tuesday here in the capital. He called for improving intelligence and training the police to better counter terrorist groups. In the last year, India has witnessed attacks on busy markets in Delhi, a Hindu temple in eastern Varanasi, and against tourists in Kashmir. The only other attack on an explicitly Muslim site was a January explosion inside a mosque in Delhi. Anil Kumbhare, a police superintendent in Malegaon, said that 29 people had died in the attack there. Reuters reported a death toll of 32."
"Indian and Pakistani officials said peace talks between their countries would open here on Wednesday as planned, reaffirming their determination not to allow the train bombings that killed at least 68 people on Sunday to upset the delicate negotiations. Pakistan's foreign minister, Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri, arrived here in the capital on Tuesday for the talks, but first stopped at a hospital to visit the wounded. ''Incidents like these that are very heart-rending and which affect both countries and both peoples can only add to the urgency of the need for cooperation,'' he told reporters. His words echoed those of his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee, who met the wounded at the same hospital earlier on Tuesday. ''We must show our determination in the peace process which we have begun,'' Mr. Mukherjee said after touring the hospital. Investigations continued into the twin blasts, which caused a fire that swept through two cars of the train traveling to Pakistan from India. Meanwhile, the police released sketches of two suspects, men they said had jumped from the moving train minutes before the explosions. At a televised news conference, Sharad Kumar, the inspector general, said the two men had told guards that they had boarded the wrong train and wanted to get off. ''The two suspects had a heated argument with the personnel of Railway Protection Force for about 20 minutes in the train, and they alighted from it when it slowed down near Diwana station,'' Mr. Kumar said, referring to the station about 50 miles north of Delhi, near the site of the explosions. He said the attack was thought to be ''the handiwork of a militant outfit, but we don't know which group is involved.'' Authorities tried to identify victims whose bodies had been taken to a temporary morgue in Panipat, near the blasts. But progress was slow, and Indian television news said only 11 people had been identified by Tuesday afternoon. As Rana Shaukatali, a Pakistani shopkeeper from Faisalabad, lay at Safdarjung Hospital here recovering from severe burns, his nephew, Khalid Khan, 28, returned from inspecting bodies. Mr. Shaukatali lost five children in the explosions. His nephew could not find any of their bodies in the heap of burned remains. Officials said DNA testing of unclaimed bodies would begin in days. Security on trains and at airports in India was increased after bomb attacks on commuter trains in Mumbai in July, but the police presence at major public places waned recently. One official at the Old Delhi station said Monday that there were no specific security checks for passengers on the route to Pakistan, other than the general checks at the entrance to the station. And relatives of passengers who went to the train on Sunday said that baggage was not searched. Many here saw the fact that the explosions on Sunday did not delay Mr. Kasuri's visit as a sign of progress in the relationship between Pakistan and India."
"A raid on a Shiite weapons cache in the southern city of Hilla one week ago is providing what American officials call the best evidence yet that the deadliest roadside bombs in Iraq are manufactured in Iran, but critics contend that the forensic case remains circumstantial and inferential. The new evidence includes infrared sensors, electronic triggering devices and information about plastic explosives used in bombs that the Americans say lead back to Iran. The explosive material, triggering devices, other components and the method of assembly all produce weapons with an Iranian signature that has never been found outside Iraq or southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah is believed to have used weapons supplied by Iran, the Americans say. But critics assert that nearly all the bomb components could have been produced in Iraq or somewhere else in the region. Even if the evidence were to establish that Iran is the source, they add, that does not necessarily mean that the Iranian leadership is responsible. The raid by American and Iraqi forces discovered a fake boulder made of polyurethane and containing three of the deadliest kind of roadside bombs in Iraq. Smeared with dirt and pebbles to give it the color and texture of a rock, the polyurethane blob was resting in the back seat of a Toyota, apparently in preparation for a roadside attack, American officials said in lengthy briefings with two New York Times reporters last week. The Toyota, along with a second vehicle and a nearby house described as an assembly point, contained components and other weaponry that the officials say demonstrate that the bomb parts must have originated in Iran. Called explosively formed penetrators, or E.F.P.'s, bombs like the ones hidden inside the fake boulder are designed to eject molten slugs that slice through American armor with deadly precision. The assertion that the latest find greatly bolsters the theory of the Iranian origin of the E.F.P.'s is significant because it could provide the United States with a new justification to take action against Iran. But the evidence is unlikely to satisfy skeptics who have been suspicious that the Bush administration is trying to lay the groundwork for isolating or even attacking Iran. They point to the flawed intelligence used by the administration to accuse Saddam Hussein of harboring unconventional weapons before invading Iraq nearly four years ago. Still, American military officials appear to be making an attempt to respond to critics who say the evidence is inconclusive. In the course of the detailed briefing on the Hilla discovery, Maj. Marty Weber, an explosives expert, said that most of the E.F.P.'s in Iraq use C-4 plastic explosive manufactured in Iran. At the request of the Bush administration, The Times is withholding some specific details about the weapons to protect intelligence sources and methods. In addition to the Hilla discovery, military officials are expected to disclose at a briefing on Monday details about materials found in a raid in Diyala Province, the mixed Sunni-Shiite battleground north of Baghdad, that, according to one military official, included enough components to make more than 100 E.F.P.'s. The official asked not to be identified because the matter is so sensitive. All of the items found in the Hilla raid have been used by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, said Major Weber, a master explosives ordnance technician who has studied many kinds of improvised bombs in the Middle East and elsewhere and is closely involved in the effort in Iraq. In addition, the shallow concave caps, which are made of copper and change into armor-piercing balls when the E.F.P.'s explode, were smooth and flawless, indicating to the explosives expert that they were manufactured in Iran because of the high precision required to make them so. Also found during the raid were 10 107-millimeter Strella rockets that had Iranian markings. A Question of Technology The most specialized part of the E.F.P.'s that were found is the concave copper disc, called a liner, that rolls into a deadly armor-piercing ball when the device explodes. Although American explosives experts say that the liner is deceptively difficult to make properly, the discs in Hilla look like a thick little alms plate or even a souvenir ashtray minus the indentations for holding cigarettes. The electronics package is built around everyday items like the motion sensors used in garage-door openers and outdoor security systems; in fact, at the heart of some of the bombs found in Iraq is a type of infrared sensor commonly sold at electronic stores like RadioShack. Major Weber said the use of precision copper discs combined with passive infrared sensors amounted to ''a no-brainer'' that the explosive components were of Iranian origin, because no one has used that sort of configuration except Iranian-backed Shiite militias. Could copper discs be manufactured with the required precision in Iraq? ''You can never be certain,'' Major Weber said. But he said that ''having studied all these groups, I've only seen E.F.P.'s used in two areas of the world: The Levant and here,'' meaning in Hezbollah areas of Lebanon and in Iraq. Hezbollah is thought to be armed and trained by Iran. Skeptics say the new details do not support a conclusion that only Iran could be providing the components. ''Iran may well be involved in the supply of these weapons, but so far they haven't proved it,'' said Joseph Cirincione, senior vice president for National Security at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research and advocacy organization. ''Before we act on the assumption that these are Iranian we've got to rule out all these other possibilities,'' he said. ''The military hasn't done that.'' He noted that a related weapon, the shape charge, ''has been around for decades. ''This is not new stuff,'' he continued. ''There is a vast international arms market selling shape charges from many countries.'' New Details The new information is more substantial than the limited details disclosed earlier this month in Baghdad, said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a research group based in Alexandria, Va. ''That initial briefing was not much to write home about,'' Mr. Pike said. ''The points that they are making here are rather more convincing. Whether they're true is a completely different question.'' Mr. Pike said he was not swayed by arguments that the copper discs could only be made by equipment in Iran. All that is required are machine tools, he said. ''You can buy them,'' he said. ''I mean, look at all those cylinders people use for L.P.G. cooking gas. Do you think they are all imported from Iran? Probably not. I bet there are guys all over Iraq who make those things for a living.'' But he found other details more persuasive. ''The two points they are making about the tradecraft of the fuse and the wrappings of the explosives, those are pretty good pieces of evidence,'' he said. ''I will say that, totally apart from any of this evidence, I would be astonished if Iran was not providing military support to the Shia militias. It should be self-evident that they are doing that.'' Afternoon Attack American officials gave this account of the Hilla raid: It took place at 1:30 p.m. on Feb. 17 after an informant reported seeing a tow truck carrying rockets. The fake rock with three E.F.P. canisters inside was sitting on the back seat of a different vehicle, a Toyota Crown. The trunk of the same car contained various equipment including an infrared sensor, a G.P.S. unit, two compasses and a jug filled with an unknown explosive. Tools and materials for making fake rocks were found inside the house along with a partly completed rock and two E.F.P.'s. Among the items found there were seven battery packs needed to set off the blasting caps that initiate the E.F.P. explosion, four cans of epoxy foam and three of the infrared sensors. The E.F.P.'s were designed to inflict maximum damage. The positioning of the sensor and the exact angles of the E.F.P.'s inside the rock were fixed to find weak points in American armored vehicles like Humvees and Strykers. ''The E.F.P. canisters are typically arrayed at angles to minimize the effects of countermeasures,'' Major Weber said. ''They want to hit the truck when it is already well into the kill zone.'' The infrared sensors could be armed and disarmed at a distance with cellphones, long-distance cordless phones or radios. That allows the attackers to arm the devices only when convoys are approaching. Then, when the convoys trip the sensors, the E.F.P.'s explode. Major Weber said many of those techniques were clearly Iranian in origin. Critics said that all of them could be replicated by skilled Iraqis or others in the Middle East with a solid knowledge of electronics and basic manufacturing techniques. Still, Major Weber said, there were other indications of Iranian involvement in Hilla. In the raid, the Iraqi and American troops also found a red 1988 Chevy tow truck carrying 10 Strella rockets under a false bottom in the bed. The rockets had MJ-1 contact fuses and were probably made in China and repainted with Iranian markings -- the usual practice for weapons that Iran imports and re-sells. Following international convention, the markings were in English, not Persian. They indicated that the rockets had been made in 2005 and each carried 18 kilograms of explosive. As to why the Iranians would leave such obvious markings on the shells, Major Weber speculated that they had simply been taken out of stock and shipped across the border. Comparisons to Others Major Weber said he doubted that Hezbollah -- the group that the Mahdi militia leader Moktada al-Sadr has used as a model for his political movement -- would have provided the material and technology to the Mahdi militia or to other Shiite fighters in Iraq. ''It is possible, but based upon my experience we have not seen Hezbollah share information or technology on anything until they have been told to,'' he said. ''The E.F.P. is their silver bullet,'' he said, referring to Iran and its allied militias. Major Weber also said that the use of passive infrared sensors, or P.I.R.'s, was one of the strongest markers of Iranian involvement, based on years of experience indicating that only Iranian-backed groups employ the sensors in that manner. But he also acknowledged that the electronic components needed to make the sensors were easily available off the shelf at places like RadioShack. Those components are used in commercial products, like motion sensors for a lighting system or garage door openers. Those products are opened up, rewired and repackaged. Sometimes on products requiring the triggering of multiple beams to close the circuit, masking tape is used to cover up some beams so that only one is triggered. ''Every P.I.R. in Iraq has been RadioShack, Digigard or Everspring,'' Major Weber said. ''But in southern Lebanon I never saw them use RadioShack.'' While he maintained that the copper liner also required specialized equipment and skills to make properly, that assertion also rests on some rather subtle distinctions. A senior military official displayed pictures of a stack of some 30 copper E.F.P. liners seized in a raid in Mahmudiya, a town south of Baghdad. Such liners, Major Weber said, were ''copycats'' stamped in Iraq, not Iran. To the untrained eye, the liners initially looked identical to the genuine ones. But Major Weber then pointed out that there were often slightly visible cracks forming circles around the tops of the liners when they were set on a table with their concave sides pointing down. Those imperfections were signs that the liners had been made in Iraq, Major Weber said. And because of the imperfections, he said, an E.F.P. made with them would be much less deadly. Such an E.F.P. would fragment rather than curl into a ball, he said, and the fragments would be much less likely to pierce armor. THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ"
"An explosion inside the Ministry of Public Works on Monday wounded an Iraqi vice president and the public works minister and killed at least five people, in what officials described as a possible assassination attempt. Though it was unclear where in the building the bomb was hidden or who the target was, the attack was the most serious breach of an Iraqi government building since November, when dozens of employees at the Ministry of Higher Education were kidnapped by gunmen dressed in police commando uniforms. Adel Abdul-Mahdi, one of Iraq's two vice presidents, was approaching a conference room lectern to address ministry employees at the time of the blast, which tore through walls and hurled him to the ground, witnesses said. His guards threw themselves on top of him, and he was immediately taken to an American-run hospital inside the Green Zone where witnesses said he was received in a wheelchair, covered in dust but smiling. Statements from several offices of the Shiite-led Iraqi government later said he was released and had returned to work. The public works minister, Reyad Ghareeb, was seriously wounded, news agencies reported. It was not clear if his wounds were life-threatening. The Ministry of Public Works is in the Sunni neighborhood of Mansour. Like nearly all government buildings in Baghdad, it is surrounded by 10-foot concrete blast walls and dozens of guards. Visitors to the building pass through metal detectors and are then searched by hand. Witnesses and Iraqi officials said it was unclear whether a bomb had been carried in by an employee or had been slipped past security by a visitor. Assassination attempts on Iraqi officials are not uncommon, and members of all sects have been singled out. Mr. Abdul-Mahdi and Mr. Ghareeb are both Shiites, and the Public Works Ministry is run by one of Iraq's leading Shiite parties, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq. Last fall, a car bomb exploded in the Green Zone near the convoy of the speaker of Parliament, Mahmoud al-Mashadani, a Sunni. Nasreen Barwari, a Kurd and the former public works minister, said three attempts were made on her life during her tenure from 2003 to 2006. She said satellite offices of the ministry were regularly singled out as well. ''I believe all governmental offices are a target all the time,'' she said. ''And the main objective is to undermine the government as a whole, and discredit its security measures or plans.'' Witnesses said the vice president, the minister and several senior ministry officials had gathered in a conference room on the third floor to give employees awards when the blast shredded rows of chairs and collapsed part of the roof onto the victims. ''While Dr. Abdul-Mahdi was trying to deliver his speech, the explosion took place,'' said a ministry employee, also wounded in the attack, who had been sitting next to the vice president. If it was a suicide bomber, the employee said, ''there would have been more people killed.'' Interior Ministry officials said three of the five people killed were women. Four of the dead held the rank of director general in the Public Works Ministry -- the middle managers who run the organization on a daily basis. On Monday, a roadside bomb in southern Baghdad killed two policemen. A mortar shell exploded in central Baghdad, where security forces have set up blast walls around open-air markets, killing two people and wounding four. Gunmen attacked a fire station in Mansour, in western Baghdad, killing three firemen and wounding three others. Authorities found 25 bodies throughout the city. Also on Monday, the political bloc loyal to anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr clarified the cleric's stance on the new Baghdad security plan, saying that Mr. Sadr still supported the plan despite a statement attributed to him on Sunday saying that the effort to pacify the capital was doomed to failure because it relied on American troops. Saleh al-Ugaili, a member of Parliament and a spokesman for Mr. Sadr's political movement, said the statement was meant to emphasize a need for more Iraqi control. ''Everybody knows that the American intervention in the duties of the army and Iraqi police confuses their work and creates opportunities for breaches,'' he said. The American military said in a statement on Monday that elements of Mr. Sadr's Mahdi Army militia ''seem to be practicing a policy of noninterference,'' with many senior leaders leaving the country and others adopting a ''wait-and-see'' attitude. The military also announced the death of a marine killed Monday during combat in Anbar Province. President Jalal Talabani's office said Monday that he was recovering from exhaustion at a hospital in Jordan and denied reports that he had heart surgery. THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ"
"An explosion and a fire that killed 15 contractors and injured 180 other workers at the giant BP oil refinery in Texas City two years ago was caused by company deficiencies ''at all levels,'' a federal safety panel reported on Tuesday. Ending its investigation of the disaster, which sent 43,000 people fleeing to indoor shelters and resulted in more than $1.5 billion in financial losses, the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board found that safety measures at the plant repeatedly fell victim to cost cutting -- even after 23 accidental deaths at the plant in the 30 years before the explosion on March 23, 2005. At a news conference, Carolyn W. Merritt, the safety board's chairwoman and chief executive, called the accident avoidable and ''the inevitable result of a series of actions by the company.'' ''They cut costs that affected maintenance and safety,'' Ms. Merritt said. ''They ignored the implications of previous accidents that were red warning flags. There was a broken safety culture at BP.'' The Justice Department is conducting a separate criminal investigation, said a lawyer representing victims, who said he had shared information from nearly 7 million company documents and 150,000 pages of depositions with federal prosecutors and investigators. The lawyer, Brent Coon of Beaumont, is to appear on Thursday in Washington at a hearing on the explosion before the House Education and Labor Committee with a client, Eva Rowe, whose parents were killed in the blast. Ms. Merritt said the safety board had provided an advance copy of its findings to the Justice Department. The report, 335 pages plus supporting documents, traced the immediate cause of the explosion, the nation's deadliest industrial accident since 1990, to high-risk startup operations after a maintenance shutdown of an octane processing tower. Because of a broken gauge, volatile hydrocarbons overflowed the tower and a connecting treatment drum. The drum was of an ''antiquated and unsafe design'' dating from the 1950s and lacked a flare system to burn off flammable vapors, which escaped into the air and were ignited by the backfire of a truck idling 25 feet away. The explosion obliterated 13 employee trailers and damaged 27 others as far as 1,000 feet away. The plant, the third-largest refinery in the United States with a capacity of about 10 million gallons a day or 2.5 percent of the gasoline sold daily nationwide, employed 1,800 workers and 800 contractors on a 1,200-acre site about 30 miles southeast of Houston. In a statement on Tuesday, BP said it ''accepted responsibility'' for the accident and apologized to the victims. The company has settled millions of dollars in claims and estimated that it would invest $1 billion to improve the plant over the next five years. Despite its ''strong disagreement with some of the content of the C.S.B. report,'' the statement said, BP ''will give full and careful consideration'' to the recommendations. The chemical safety board also criticized the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, saying it had failed to follow up earlier accidents at the plant and refused to share information with the board. Edwin G. Foulke Jr., assistant secretary of labor for OSHA, did not respond to the board's complaints but said in a statement that the agency had fined BP a record $21 million after the explosion and was enacting a program ''to ensure that every refinery under its jurisdiction is inspected and all employees are protected.'' The five-member safety board scheduled a public meeting with Texas City residents on Tuesday evening, after which it planned to vote on adopting the report. ''The Texas City disaster was caused by organizational and safety deficiencies at all levels of the BP Corporation,'' the report stated. ''Warning signs of a possible disaster were present for several years, but company officials did not intervene effectively to prevent it.'' Before and after BP's 1999 merger with Amoco, the previous plant owner, cost cutting left the refinery particularly ''vulnerable to a catastrophe,'' the report said. BP instituted further budget cuts of 25 percent in 1999 and another 25 percent in 2005 ''even though much of the refinery's infrastructure was process equipment in disrepair.'' In 2004, three workers were critically burned, two of them fatally, and just months after the 2005 explosion two accidents caused $32 million in property damage. ''The combination of cost cutting, production pressures and failure to invest caused a progressive deterioration of safety at the refinery,'' said Don Holmstrom, the supervising investigator for the safety board. BP, which financed an earlier inquiry by a panel headed by James A. Baker III, a former secretary of state, has denied that budget cuts played any part in the accidents. But the safety board released company documents reflecting internal concerns over cost cutting, including a 2003 health and safety audit of the Texas City plant by BP managers from other facilities citing a ''checkbook mentality'' that shortchanged efforts to address risks. The board also found that four operators on the equipment that exploded in Texas City were fatigued from working at least 29 straight days of 12-hour shifts. It further cited a 2004 safety assessment of the Texas City plant by consultants from the Telos Group who said, ''We have never seen an organization with such a history of leadership changes over such short period of time.'' The consultants found ''little organizational stability'' and said they had never seen such ''intensity of worry'' about a catastrophe ''by those closest to the valve.''"
"A freight train carrying liquid propane derailed yesterday in a rural section of central New York State, and the accident was accompanied by a thunderous explosion and a fierce fire that forced the evacuation of homes, schools and a jail in the area, halted passenger train service and temporarily shut a section of the New York State Thruway, the authorities said. There were no deaths or injuries as a result of the explosion in Oneida, a city of about 10,000, shortly after 7 a.m., State Trooper James Simpson said, and the conductor and an engineer both walked away. More than 25 of the 79 rail cars derailed as the train, operated by the CSX Corporation and traveling from Buffalo to Selkirk, just south of Albany, reached the northern edge of Oneida, about halfway between Syracuse and Utica. Five of about 40 cars loaded with liquid propane ignited, shooting a fireball high into the early-morning sky and spreading thick black smoke into the air for miles. The power of the explosion rattled windows in downtown Oneida, rocked homes in neighboring towns and touched off dozens of 911 calls, the police said. ''I was shaken awake,'' said Myron Peebles, a 62-year-old retired power plant employee who lives about a half-mile from the site of the explosion. ''The sun had not yet come up, but my blinds were orange. I peeked out and I couldn't believe it. The woods were glowing, and then I saw this huge orange column going up. I thought that a large airliner had crashed in the woods behind my house.'' Billie Keller, mayor of Wampsville, a neighboring village of 600 residents, said: ''I was sitting at home, drinking coffee, and I heard this massive blast. The whole house shook.'' Traffic on a 23-mile stretch of the Thruway, which runs parallel to the train tracks and is 1,000 feet away, was closed in both directions west of Exit 33 for about four hours while the fire was burning itself out. Amtrak, which runs passenger service on the track owned by CSX, halted train service between Buffalo and Albany, shuttling passengers by bus instead, a spokesman for the railroad said. Three of the derailed cars, which contained liquid propane and toluene, an industrial solvent, were still burning last night, and the spokesman for Amtrak, Cliff Cole, said that service would not be restored until at least this afternoon. Some of the cars were carrying ferric chloride, which is used in sewage treatment and water filtration. A CSX spokesman, Robert Sullivan, said that it was still unclear whether the derailment touched off the explosion or the propane in the tanks blew up first, causing the train to derail. The tracks are inspected twice a week, Mr. Sullivan said. For almost an hour after the explosion, emergency crews struggled to get to the site, said Michael Whipple, Oneida's deputy fire chief, although it is only about a mile from downtown. He said the smoke and flames were coming from an isolated thicket of wood that could be reached by a remote access road. Once firefighters got to the pile of mangled cars, the heat was so intense that they could do nothing but watch the inferno burn from a distance, he said, and the chemicals in the cars carried the threat of another explosion. In addition, the closest source of water was about a mile from the derailment, he said, so firefighters had to connect hose after hose along a parallel roadway. Police officers went from door to door within a mile of the explosion, seeking to advise the roughly 4,000 residents of the area where to seek shelter if they wanted to leave their homes. The evacuation was mandatory only for the homes closest to the site and ended up affecting no more than eight families, Trooper Simpson said. Classes at two elementary schools near the site of the raging fire were canceled. The Oneida schools superintendent, Ron Spadafora, said that most parents had been prepared for the cancellation because the blast occurred about two hours before the start of school. In addition, 76 inmates boarded yellow school buses that took them from the Madison County Jail in Wampsville to the jail in Norwich, about 40 miles to the south, said the county sheriff, Ronald Cary. The Red Cross set up a shelter in the New Beginnings Free Methodist Church in Wampsville. Skip Hellmig, its pastor, said that a few hundred people came by during the day, but that all had been able to return home by late afternoon. Adults stretched out in the pews, watching the news from a big-screen television set up in the sanctuary, Pastor Hellmig said, and the children were able to bathe and change in the nursery. ''We just kept a steady flow of coffee and tea and juices flowing to everybody,'' said Pastor Hellmig, who compared the explosion with ''those pictures of the Arizona when it blew up in Pearl Harbor.'' ''The heavy black smoke went straight up in a column, and the column stayed pretty contained because the wind wasn't blowing,'' he said of yesterday's conflagration. ''After it got up about 100 feet, the wind kind of fanned it out and blew it northeast, away from us.''"
"A huge explosion on Wednesday in a hunting supplies store here killed at least six people and wounded nine, and a few hours later a suicide bomber detonated explosives strapped to his chest in a bazaar in the eastern province of Khost, killing five people and wounding 38, officials said. The early morning explosion in Kabul shook the city and turned an outdoor market near the store into a mass of debris. Afghan officials said that the explosion appeared to have been an accident and that it had occurred in a place where gunpowder and dynamite were stored. Relatives of the store's owners were digging in the debris on Wednesday to try to find the victims. The blast also destroyed more than a dozen other shops and two vehicles. The suicide bombing came hours later in the provincial capital, Khost. Four civilians and a police officer were killed, and the wounded included nine police officers and two children, said the provincial public health director, Dr. Muhammadin, who, like many Afghans, uses only one name. The attack was apparently aimed at a police convoy patrolling the crowded bazaar. It was the fourth attack in 24 hours by suspected insurgents in the volatile southern and eastern areas of Afghanistan, where fighters linked to the Taliban are active. Two suicide attacks and a roadside bomb killed four people and wounded at least 10 in southern Afghanistan on Tuesday. Arsallah Jamal, the governor of Khost Province, blamed ''the enemy of Afghanistan'' for the attack, a term he has used for fighters suspected of being allied with the ousted Taliban government and Al Qaeda. ''We want the international community to help us more and pressure our neighboring countries to stand firm on the campaign against international terrorism,'' he said by phone, in a clear reference to Pakistan, where militants are believed to be hiding in the border areas."
"A methane gas explosion on Monday in a Siberian coal mine, in a region notorious for mine accidents, killed at least 78 people, and dozens were still trapped underground by late evening, emergency officials said. The explosion, one of the most deadly in recent years, occurred at the Ulyanovskaya coal mine in the city of Novokuznetsk, in south-central Russia, with about 200 people inside, said Valery B. Korchagin, a spokesman for the local emergency affairs ministry. Rescuers have pulled at least 83 survivors from the mine, 2 of whom were injured, he said. Rescue workers were still there late in the evening, though it was unclear whether they were in contact with those still trapped in the mine, Mr. Korchagin said. At least one British citizen, a contractor, was in the mine at the time of the explosion, Reuters reported, but the person's whereabouts were unknown as of Monday night. According to initial reports, the explosion occurred after the collapse of the mine's main roof and the spread of methane through its inner corridors, the official Ria Novosti news agency reported, citing information from the regional administration. The mine is one of the newest in the region, having begun operations in October 2002, the Ministry of Industry said. Aman-Geldi M. Tuleev, the governor of the Kemerovo region, where the explosion took place, told Russian television that the mine was equipped with state-of-the-art technology. In addition, he said, the mine was to have been equipped on Monday with a new, British-made security system. He said that around the time of the explosion the system showed an unexpected increase in the volume of methane, but it was unclear whether officials had taken note of the increase. In a sign of the severity of the accident, President Vladimir V. Putin ordered Sergei K. Shoigu, the emergency situations minister, to fly to the scene, according to the president's Web site. There have been several mine accidents in the Kemerovo region in recent years. In 2004, an explosion in the Taizhina mine killed 47 people. In Russia in 2006, there were 21 mine accidents in which 84 people died, said Olga I. Glinina, the editor of the Russian coal mining journal, Ugol. The latest accident occurred in February, when the Dzerzhinsky mine collapsed with 220 people inside. One person was killed. Speaking to the radio station Ekho Moskvy about the accident, Aleksandr Sergeev, the chairman of the Russian Union of Miners, said it was ''imperative to suspend underground coal extraction without the necessary clearing of methane from the mine's surface.''"
"Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad came under fierce assault once again on Saturday, following two weeks of violence that left at least 300 dead and many hundreds more wounded. Many of the recent attacks, nearly all of them in heavily Shiite areas, have occurred during the period of commemoration that leads to one of the holiest days for Shiites, an intense day of mourning known as Ashura that falls this year on Monday. Three American soldiers died when a roadside bomb exploded near their vehicle on Saturday north of Baghdad, Reuters reported. The news service said that the military confirmed the deaths of two other soldiers who were killed Thursday when their patrol was attacked in eastern Baghdad, and said that two additional soldiers died in separate episodes on Friday in Diyala Province. Sunni militants have previously staged attacks on Shiites on Ashura, and fears are especially pronounced this year because it will be the first observance of the holy day since the sharp rise in sectarian killings after the bombing of a revered shrine in Samarra last February. Basim Shareef, a member of Parliament and part of the Shiite coalition that controls the government, said the attacks might be timed to coincide with the Shiite holy days. But he thought it was more likely that militants were taking advantage of the relative lull in activity by Shiite militia leaders, who might be worried about becoming the targets of the new Baghdad security plan. ''I think the parties that might retaliate believe that they are targeted in the new security plan, and that is why they have not taken any retribution,'' he said. In Saturday's deadliest attack, at least 15 people were killed and 55 wounded when twin car bombs exploded near a busy market and movie theater in eastern Baghdad, according to an Interior Ministry official. The first car exploded after barreling into a crowded intersection, where many Shiites had gathered to perform rituals common in the period leading to Ashura, including self-flagellation. A second bomb, in a vehicle parked nearby, exploded moments later. It was timed to inflict maximum damage just as a crowd gathered to help the victims of the first blast, according to an Iraqi security official. Women in black chadors helped victims covered in blood reach rescue workers as militia members flooded the area. At the time of the attack, the neighborhood, known as Jadida, was being guarded by Shiite militiamen as well as the Iraqi Army and the police, residents said. Although it is unclear who was behind the attack, coordinated car bombings are considered to be a hallmark of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, which includes foreign fighters. The spate of recent attacks appear to have been intended not just to inflict the maximum amount of civilian suffering, but also to grind all aspects of daily life closer to a halt. In a little over a week, schools, busy markets and even an animal market have been targets. Saturday's violence came on a day when President Bush discussed the new security plan by telephone with Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. According to a statement released by Mr. Maliki's office, Mr. Bush ''renewed his commitment to the Iraqi government.'' Despite the violence and the threat of even worse attacks, Iraqi officials said they did not expect ceremonies associated with Ashura to be altered. Ashura marks the seventh-century death of the Prophet Muhammad's grandson, Hussein, in the battle of Karbala, where the biggest gatherings will be held Monday. Last year's holy day was marked by scattered violence in which fewer than a dozen people were killed, but the two years before that were deadlier. Two years ago, on the eve and the day of Ashura, 11 suicide bombers killed at least 74 people. In 2004, more than 180 people were killed during Iraq's Ashura commemorations. In other violence in Baghdad on Saturday, gunmen killed five people from the same Shiite family and wounded three more after storming a home in the Amil neighborhood, the Iraqi authorities said. Forty bodies were found around the city, most tortured and executed. And in the Shiite area of Karada, gunmen stormed the office of a computer store and kidnapped at least eight people. The attack began when four camouflaged S.U.V.'s swept into the crowded street of computer shops just outside the capital's Technology University shortly after noon, witnesses said. Men in camouflage commando uniforms poured out, witnesses said, fired into the air, shouted for people to get into their homes and stormed the Al Basra computer company, situated on the second floor of a nondescript concrete house on the main thoroughfare. They seized the workers and fled. It was unclear whether the abductors were the police or Iraqi soldiers, or impostors. Elsewhere, American forces continued to clash with militants, killing 14 insurgents in an airstrike early on Saturday in Diyala Province. The attack was directed against ''a known foreign-fighter safe house'' as the men inside tried to flee, a military statement said. There was also an explosion in the early evening Saturday in the Green Zone that set off alarms, activating a mechanized voice warning people to duck and cover. It shook houses blocks away and followed an attack on Friday, when two rockets left six non-American workers wounded, according to an American official."
"An explosion at a store near a West Virginia ski resort yesterday killed four people and injured five others, the authorities said. The blast occurred just before 11 a.m. at the Flat Top Little General Store on Route 19 in southern West Virginia, shattering windows about a mile away and toppling a fire truck that had responded to the scene after a 911 call about a propane gas leak, fire officials said. A local volunteer firefighter, a county building inspector and an emergency medical technician, all investigating the leak, were among the dead, whose names were not released, the police said. Investigators said they believed the blast was caused by gas that seeped into the store from a propane tank and ignited. Describing the gnarled wreckage at a news conference in Ghent, a state fire marshal, Sterling Lewis, said, ''The best way to explain that for you is to imagine an explosion in your home and when you walk back up to your home the only thing that's left is toothpicks.'' ''I've lived here for 52 years,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''I passed that store every day and bought coffee for myself and Cokes for the kids. When I pulled up and saw none of that store existing, I knew we had a problem.'' The store had two above-ground 500-pound propane tanks, but just the leaking gas, not the tanks themselves, seems to have exploded, Mr. Lewis said. The police said they would close Route 19 for the rest of the night. Nora Radford, who lives a few hundred yards south of the store on Route 19, said she was thrown from a couch by the explosion. ''I thought it was a tanker on the main road blew up or something,'' Ms. Radford said. ''Everything was flattened. A couple of cars that I saw were flipped on their side, pretty much just scrap metal.'' Ghent, about 70 miles south of Charleston, sits on the edge of the Winterplace Ski Resort. Residents more than a half mile away from the explosion compared the sound to a sonic boom or a tractor-trailer tire blowout. Ben Monast, the manager of the Ski Shop, a half mile down the mountain from the store, said he was seated at his desk when he heard a boom and felt the concussion in his chest. ''I thought we'd been hit by lightning,'' Mr. Monast said, adding that he immediately lifted his feet off the floor as an added precaution. ''The whole place shook pretty violently.'' Gov. Joe Manchin III arrived at the scene in the afternoon to console the families of the dead and injured. ''This is a very difficult time for not only the families, but also for the first responders and the entire community of Ghent,'' Governor Manchin said. ''I've been through too much of this in the last year, year and a half. There is a void that will never be filled.'' Asked about his emotions after a year in which more than 20 coal miners died in accidents in West Virginia, he said: ''You never get used to it. Nor should you. Everything has changed. Parents lose a child. Children don't have a parent now. But it's their faith, their faith in God that gets them through.'' By 4 p.m. yesterday, the flag at the volunteer fire department was at half staff. ''I don't cry over things easily,'' said William Manning, a bartender at the Bear Den, a nearby tavern, as his eyes filled with tears and turned red. ''They're my best friends. I've known these people most of my life. You can't replace them.''"
"The Socialist government of Spain will never again negotiate with the Basque separatist group ETA after a deadly attack on Madrid's main airport terminal nine days ago, Interior Minister Alfredo P√©rez Rubalcaba said Monday. ''They broke their word, they deceived,'' Mr. Rubalcaba said of ETA, which he blamed for the attack. ''They have a different logic, a murderous, psychopathic logic.'' He added: ''There will never again be another credible truce with ETA. The next time they call a truce, everyone will say, 'A truce -- just like the one at Barajas,' '' referring to the name of the Madrid airport. In a 90-minute interview on Monday evening, Mr. Rubalcaba said the attack, which destroyed a new five-story parking garage and left two people dead and about two dozen wounded, came as a complete surprise not only to the government but also to ETA's own political wing. ''Nobody really knows why ETA did it, because we've even seen that Batasuna has been completely shaken by it,'' Mr. Rubalcaba said, referring to the military organization's political apparatus. ''ETA even deceived its own political arm. We knew there was tension with ETA and with Batasuna, but this was a surprise. It was impossible to predict something like this.'' In addition to the casualties and tens of millions of dollars of damage to Madrid's state-of-the-art airport terminal, opened only early last January, the attack also represents the most serious setback in Prime Minister Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero's nearly three years in office. Mr. Rubalcaba, a close confidant of Mr. Zapatero who took over as interior minister last April, defended the government's decision to begin a peace process with ETA in June, three months after it declared a permanent cease-fire. But the minister accused ETA of miscalculating by thinking it could ''soften up'' the government by using violence while hoping to keep talking. ''They wanted to negotiate with the only thing they know, which is violence,'' he said. ''But they went too far.'' Mr. Rubalcaba also released new details of the bombing. He said three phone calls were made within three minutes of each other just before 8 a.m. on Dec. 30, two to the Basque emergency service and one to the Madrid fire service saying that the attack would take place at 9 a.m. Two of the calls were made from a caller on a cellphone purchased in the Basque city of Bilbao, he said. The caller also unsuccessfully tried to place four phone calls to the Basque newspaper Gara, presumably also to disclose the imminent attack. It was before working hours, and ''no one answered the phone,'' Mr. Rubalcaba said. The calls included information about the model, license plate number and location of the burgundy Renault van packed with explosives in the parking lot. One of the warning calls was in the name of ETA. After verifying that the threats were credible, the police located the van twenty minutes before the bomb was set to explode, which meant there was no time to detonate it, only to evacuate the parking lot. Two Ecuadorean residents of Spain, Diego Armando Estacio, 19, a construction worker, and Carlos Alonso Palate, 35, a plastics factory worker, who were asleep in their cars awaiting arriving passengers and unseen by the police, were killed. Mr. Rubalcaba said the deaths ''were probably not part of ETA's plan.'' He explained that the main reason the government was caught by surprise was that it assumed ETA would follow its past history and formally announce that it was breaking its cease-fire before committing a major act of violence. Even signs over the past several months that ETA had not renounced violence, including the seizure of 350 pistols last October from an armory in France that was linked to the group, were not enough to convince the government that the peace process was going off course. ''Of course we didn't like these acts, and we never let down our guard, but we looked at ETA's history, and over and over ETA has never broken a truce without warning,'' he said. Mr. Rubalcaba said he was certain ETA, and not an Islamic terrorist group like the one that carried out the March 2004 Madrid train bombings, was behind the attack. ''Radical Islamists don't give you warnings; radical Islamists want to kill a lot of people,'' Mr. Rubalcaba said. He also noted that the political wing of ETA neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the attack, unlike its immediate denial of responsibility following the March 2004 bombings that left 191 people dead. What is striking is that despite Spain's long history in combating ETA's terrorism, it had no warning through its intelligence and security services that an attack, which was meticulously carried out, was imminent. Three days before the attack, for example, the van was stolen from a Spaniard who was kidnapped while on a mountain-climbing trip in southwestern France and only released shortly after the bomb went off. No arrests have been made. Mr. Rubalcaba said there were several leads, although he acknowledged that the police did not know the identity of the caller announcing the attacks. Despite dozens of samples from the site, Spanish explosives experts still have not determined the size of the bomb or the nature of the explosives used. ''When you have such a powerful explosion, it's very, very complicated to find any residue,'' said Mr. Rubalcaba, an organic chemist by training. The Spanish police and intelligence services now find themselves in the uncomfortable position of not knowing ETA's motives or future strategy and whether it may unleash a new wave of violence that could involve casualties. Last Thursday night, nearly 100 kilograms, or 220 pounds, of explosives were found in an abandoned car near the Basque town of Amorebeita ready to be detonated; the next day, a backpack filled with more explosives was discovered on a Basque hillside. Mr. Rubalcaba said the arms caches probably were abandoned when ETA followers fled the sites after the recent attack. ''ETA made a decision in 2003 to stop killing,'' Mr. Rubalcaba said. ''What we are asking ourselves now is whether that decision is being reconsidered. We don't know.''"
"The foot was balanced on a shopping bag after being scooped up off the dirty street by a man in a track suit. There was no person to go with the limb. Nearby a charred body was still smoldering, smoke coming off the black corpse 45 minutes after the attack. For 50 yards, the dead were scattered about, some in pieces, some whole but badly burned. This violence on Thursday involved two bombs timed to go off one after another in the formerly upscale neighborhood of Mansour, which continues to be ripped apart by sectarian violence. Thirteen people were killed and 22 wounded, just a small fraction of the civilians killed across the country this week. The first device went off at 10:15 a.m., probably a roadside bomb set on a timer, officials said. The attack was apparently aimed at a gasoline station. Cars were lined up around the block waiting for fuel, and dozens of people, grasping large plastic jugs, hoped to buy heating fuel. Just moments after the first explosion, a second, larger, car bomb detonated. The neighborhood has traditionally been a mixed Sunni and Shiite one. Although the Abu Jaffar gas station, where the attack was centered, is in what is considered a Sunni area, the method of the attack -- multiple bombs timed to explode in succession -- is usually thought of as a trademark of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a Sunni insurgent group. An hour after the explosion, there was still a strong stench of burning gasoline and fire. The road was slick with sludge from the water used to douse the fire. Blood pooled in areas. Scores of armed men were running about, including members of the Iraqi Army and the police. Some of those with machine guns had no uniforms at all. Shots rang out, mostly in warning. Neighbors gathered outside, oddly calm and seemingly accustomed to such carnage. A tanker truck filled with fuel was parked near the station, having escaped the blast. Not surprisingly, residents living near the area blamed everyone from the government to the Americans to terrorists for what had happened. ''We are just innocent people,'' said Nafia Abdul Jabbar. ''The people killed were poor, in need of kerosene that they cannot afford to buy on the black market because the price is 10 times more than it is at the station.'' Elsewhere, a mortar attack was directed at the Shiite neighborhood of Huriya, wounding three people, officials said. Clashes on the outskirts of the Sunni neighborhood of Ghazaliya left two people dead and 25 people wounded, Iraqi officials said. A grenade attack in the Amin neighborhood killed five people. Across the city on Thursday, officials said, 47 bodies were found mutilated -- 4 of them with their heads cut off. An interview with the family of a man recently mutilated and killed, a prominent sheik considered to be the prince of the Tamim tribes, gives a glimpse into the complicated underworld that is, in part, responsible for the trucks full of bodies collected around this city every day. The man, Sheik Hamid Mohammed al-Suhail, 75, was found Wednesday in the Shuala neighborhood of Baghdad, a Shiite redoubt, by members of his tribe, which is mixed Shiite and Sunni, who were searching for him. He disappeared last Sunday, and his mutilated body was found wrapped in a blanket, covered in blood. The search party recognized his body by the distinctive way the beard was trimmed. He had been an outspoken critic of the sectarian fighting and participated in a recent conference in Cairo on national reconciliation. The kidnappers, whom his relatives hinted they knew but would describe only as ''militiamen'' for fear of reprisal, initially called his family asking for $100,000, said a nephew, Sheik Ali Sammi al-Suhail. The family told the kidnappers they did not have the money, the nephew said. ''The body was mutilated in a brutal way,'' he said. ''They used a drill on him and perhaps other tools.'' One hand and one leg were almost completely severed. The nephew said he had been told by people who said they witnessed the killing that after his uncle was tortured, his body was thrown from a two-story building. He survived the fall but was brutalized further before finally being killed. Another prominent Iraqi figure, Sheik Akram al-Zubeidi, was killed Thursday in Karbala, a Shiite holy city where there has been little sectarian strife. Sheik Zubeidi was assassinated when he was stopped at a fake checkpoint, a local hospital official said. Three other people in the car with him were also killed by the gunmen, whose motive was unclear. There was continued fallout Thursday from the execution of Saddam Hussein, as Sunnis, from Kashmir to Libya, used his death as a rallying point. The Libyan government announced that it would erect a statue of him to stand next to one of Libya's own national heroes, news agencies reported. At least nine people were hurt in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir when the police fired rubber-coated bullets to break up a large group of people protesting the execution, Reuters reported. Two Iraqi officials involved in the investigation of the distribution of a graphic video of the hanging said Thursday that a second guard was being held for questioning. Officials announced the arrest of the first guard on Wednesday. There is increasing pressure, including from the White House, on the Iraqi government to proceed with caution in carrying out the execution of Mr. Hussein's two co-defendants, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, Mr. Hussein's half brother, and Awad al-Bandar, a former judge. Despite the international reaction directed at the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, Mr. Maliki's popularity among Shiites in southern Iraq seems to have increased. In Basra, Iraq's second largest city, hundreds of demonstrators representing Islamist parties rallied in the streets, praising Mr. Maliki and setting photos of Mr. Hussein on fire. THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ"
"A powerful explosion, reportedly caused by a rocket, rocked the American Embassy in Athens Friday morning. Reuters, quoting the police and embassy officials, said that a rocket had been fired at the complex but that no one was hurt. The private-television station MEGA also reported that the cause was a rocket. ''This was a rocket attack launched from a building across the street,'' a senior police official told Reuters. ''It landed inside a toilet on the third floor of the embassy.'' Greek anti-terrorist officers were on the scene. ''This is an act of terrorism. We don't know where from,'' said the Attica police chief, Asimakis Golfis. ''There was a shell that exploded in the toilets of the building.'' He said it had been fired from street level. The police cordoned off the block and were searching nearby apartment buildings and a hospital. The police said the explosion occurred at 5:55 a.m., but they released little other information. Early accounts from witnesses indicated that it had occurred at the embassy's front entrance, near the eagle emblem, Agence France-Presse said. Greek news media reported that a window near the emblem has been smashed, but there was no indication of further damage. ''The explosion sounded in the courtyard, then a fire broke out over the central entrance, where the emblem is situated,'' a Greek motorist told private Skai radio."
"Bombs ravaged Baghdad in five horrific explosions aimed mainly at Shiite crowds on Wednesday, killing at least 171 people in the deadliest day in the capital since the American-led security plan for the city took effect two months ago. The wave of attacks, four of them involving car bombs, took place as Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki declared that the Iraqi government planned to take full control of security from the American-led forces before the end of the year. In the worst of the bombings, a car packed with explosives exploded at an intersection in the Sadriya neighborhood that serves as a hub for buses traveling to the Shiite district of Sadr City. The blast killed at least 140 people and wounded 150; incinerated scores of vehicles, including several minibuses full of passengers; and charred nearby shops, witnesses and the police said. Mr. Maliki said in a statement late Wednesday that he had ordered the arrest of an Iraqi Army officer who had security oversight in the Sadriya neighborhood. As rescuers thronged the site, a sniper opened fire on the crowd, killing at least one person and wounding two others. ''The blast threw me to the ground and shattered a window over my body,'' said Salar Kamal Zari, a 37-year-old teacher visiting from Kurdistan, who had just stepped into a nearby store when the bomb exploded. ''I saw a human head in front of the store and many cars burning and smoke everywhere.'' ''I will never stay in Baghdad anymore,'' he vowed. The Baghdad security plan calls for 28,000 additional American troops, as well as thousands of Iraqi soldiers, most of whom will be deployed in the streets of the violent capital in an attempt to pacify it. But Mr. Maliki said the gradual transfer to Iraqi authority would continue, with three provinces in the relatively tranquil region of Kurdistan the next to come under Iraqi security authority, followed by Karbala and Wasit Provinces in the south. ''In this way, province by province, we will reach the end of the line before the end of the year,'' the prime minister said in a speech delivered by Mowaffak al-Rubaie, his national security adviser. The speech observed the transfer of the southern province of Maysan from British to Iraqi control. Maysan is the fourth of Iraq's 18 provinces to be handed to Iraqi security forces. American commanders have said that the Baghdad security effort has reduced the kinds of sectarian killings associated with Shiite death squads, in part because of the decision by many militia fighters to lay low. But the plan has failed to curb the spectacular attacks, many of them suicide bombings, that have become a gruesome hallmark of the Sunni Arab-led insurgent group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. As a result, commanders say, overall civilian casualty rates are actually higher now than they were before the plan was initiated. ''As we've said before, it's going to be a tough fight,'' said Lt. Col. Christopher Garver, an American military spokesman. But, he added, ''The plan is not even fully implemented yet.'' Two American brigades -- a total of about 7,000 soldiers -- are still scheduled to arrive in Iraq and join three other brigades that have poured into the capital and surrounding areas, he said. American commanders say their strategy to prevent these sorts of attacks focuses on rooting out insurgent redoubts in predominantly Sunni towns and villages on the capital's periphery, or what they call ''the Baghdad belts.'' ''A high-priority mission is finding these car bomb factories and getting rid of them, and capturing and killing the terrorists who make the bombs,'' Colonel Garver said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. Because of the complexity of building a car bomb -- the process can require a near-complete dismantling of the vehicle -- most are probably made in sparsely populated areas where the work can be more easily concealed, the American commanders say. Wednesday's attacks risked reawakening the dormant Shiite militias, especially the Mahdi Army of Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, and reigniting the cycles of sectarian violence that tormented Baghdad after the bombing of a revered Shiite shrine in Samarra in February 2006. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said the Sunni insurgency's intent was to provoke more sectarian violence. ''We can only hope that the Shia will have the confidence in their government and in the coalition that we'll go after the people that perpetrated this horror,'' he told reporters in Tel Aviv after meeting with Israel's defense minister, Amir Peretz. Officials in Mr. Sadr's office in Sadr City would not comment Wednesday on whether the bombing campaign would provoke a resurgence of the Mahdi Army, though they declared that the continuing attacks underscored the failure of the security plan. ''The security situation is worsening,'' said Abdul Mehdi Mutayri, one of the top political officers for Mr. Sadr's organization. ''The security plan might have been declared a success in the media, but it has failed on the ground.'' The Sadriya bombing recalled an attack near the same spot on Feb. 3, when a truck bombing killed at least 137 people, wounded 305 and obliterated a popular market. Mr. Maliki said in a statement that he had ordered the arrest of the commander of the Iraqi Army's Second Battalion, Second Brigade, ''because of the repetition of tragedy in the Sadriya district, showing the weakness of the security planning to protect civilians.'' After the blast on Wednesday, scores of residents from the neighborhood gathered at the site to gawk at the wreckage, mourn the victims and shout imprecations. ''Oh God, what did they do?'' a man yelled. Women standing on a balcony overlooking the intersection beat their chests in a traditional sign of grief. In the mayhem that ensued, even more people died. A sniper opened fire on the crowd, killing at least one person and wounding two others. The shots appeared to come from the adjoining neighborhood of Fadhel, which is predominantly Sunni Arab. Rahim Rahim Karim Hmait, a 43-year-old taxi driver, said he tried to evacuate several wounded people to the hospital. But as he approached an army patrol at high speed, soldiers, perhaps thinking he was a suicide bomber, opened fire on his taxi. He was hit in the abdomen, leg and hand, he said. ''I lost control and the car smashed into one of the shops,'' he said in an interview at a hospital in Sadr City, where he was taken for care. ''Some of the wounded people died inside the car.'' Earlier in the afternoon, a suicide car bomber detonated himself near an Iraqi police checkpoint at an entrance to Sadr City, home to more than 1.5 million people, mostly Shiites. The explosion ripped through a bottleneck of vehicles and pedestrians waiting to pass through the checkpoint, killing at least 17 people and wounding at least 45, an Interior Ministry official said. In another attack, a parked car packed with explosives exploded on a busy shopping street in the predominantly Shiite neighborhood of Karada, killing at least 10 people and wounding at least 13, according to the Interior Ministry official. The blast also damaged a nearby private hospital and several other buildings. In Saidiya, a mixed neighborhood in western Baghdad, a car bomb killed two people and wounded eight, including three police officers, the official said. A bomb on a minibus detonated as the bus passed through the Shiite district of Rusafa in central Baghdad, killing at least two people and wounding five, the police said. In the district of Uaireej, south of Baghdad, a suicide car bomber detonated himself near a police patrol, killing two police officers and wounding four people, including two police officers and two civilians, the Interior Ministry official said. In another attack, a vehicle belonging to a private security detail exploded in the parking lot outside the entrance to the highly secure complex that includes Baghdad International Airport and the main military base of the American command, coalition security officials said. There were no reports of casualties. According to the security officials, the vehicle pulled into the lot, its occupants got out, and the car blew up. The blast tossed the vehicle onto the roof of a neighboring car, according to the officials, igniting both vehicles and snarling traffic around the airport for the entire day. In Diyala Province, a government security official said Wednesday that 19 insurgents and 2 policemen were killed in heavy clashes on Sunday between Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and the Iraqi security forces in the villages of Al Mohola and Albosbaa, about 12 miles northeast of Baquba. Fighting between government security forces and insurgents in Muqtadiya, north of Baquba, ended in the death of three insurgents and the arrest of four others, the security official said. Another Iraqi soldier was killed by gunmen in Khalis, northeast of Baghdad. In Mosul, fighting between insurgents and the Iraqi Army and police killed six police officers, one soldier and a civilian, according to Brig. Saeed Abdullah al-Jubouri, a spokesman for the provincial police in Nineveh Province. THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ"
"A suicide truck bomb loaded with chlorine gas exploded in Ramadi on Friday, killing as many as 30 people, many of them children, a security official said. The explosion burned victims' lungs, eyes and skin. Dr. Ali Abdullah Saleh, of the main Ramadi hospital, said 30 people had been admitted with shrapnel wounds and 15 had been sent to a second hospital in the city. He said 50 people had been admitted for breathing problems. It was at least the sixth chlorine bomb detonated in Anbar Province since late January and the most lethal, though it appears that most victims were killed by the explosion rather than the chlorine. Insurgents have also used chlorine bombs in the northern part of Baghdad, the capital, and near Taji, a town about 20 miles to the north. The attacker in Ramadi struck in the late morning of the Muslim day of prayer, when children off from school usually play in the street and adults run errands and visit before going to the mosque at midday. The truck, a fuel tanker loaded with the toxic gas, sped toward an Iraqi police checkpoint, according to witnesses and Col. Tareq al-Dulaimi, the head of security for Anbar Province. The police officers opened fire and the truck swerved toward a residential area, where the bomb exploded, he said. The United States military said in a statement that some victims had been evacuated to hospitals at American facilities in Iraq. The military said that the use of chlorine gas had been suspected but not confirmed, and that it was unclear whether the explosion had been set off by the police gunfire or by the suicide bomber. Anbar Province is a stronghold of the Sunni insurgency, and a haven for the insurgent group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. There has been fierce fighting in the area between tribes who support Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and those who oppose it and now work more closely with the government. In the past two months, there have been assassinations and bomb attacks on the tribes opposing Al Qaeda, including three truck bombs filled with chlorine gas in mid-March. In military action, there was a daylong fight between American soldiers and Shiite militia members in the city of Diwaniya, south of Baghdad, a statement from the Fourth Brigade Combat Team of the 25th Infantry Division in Baghdad said. The operation's goal seemed to be to reduce the influence of Shiite militias in the area. Residents of Diwaniya said the operation began before dawn when Iraqi and American soldiers closed off neighborhoods known to be havens for Shiite militias, including the Mahdi Army, aligned with the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr. Residents said the soldiers distributed pamphlets asking people to cooperate with the American and Iraqi troops and then began house-to-house searches. The statement said three militia members were killed and six wounded. The police put the death toll at 10 but said several were civilians killed during the shooting. American and Iraqi forces uncovered an assembly area for the powerful roadside bombs known as explosively formed projectiles, the statement said. Four bombs were already assembled, it added, and others were in various stages of being put together. Residents said there had been open fighting in central Diwaniya between American soldiers and members of the Mahdi Army. There seemed to be little effort on the part of local residents to defend the militia, they said. Several said they held militia members responsible for killings and kidnappings in the area. Mr. Sadr's office in Diwaniya sharply criticized the operation. ''This operation is unjustified,'' said Haydar al-Natiq, who runs the office. ''It will stir up the situation in the time where a peace conference was supposed to be held between the Sadrists and the security forces.'' In Baghdad, 11 bodies were found Friday, the Interior Ministry announced. Mortars and gunfire killed at least four others in the capital, it said. Residents in the predominantly Sunni Arab district of Adamiya said American soldiers had killed a civilian in the neighborhood. The American military said it had no information on the episode. The United States military said Friday in a statement that a soldier had been shot to death in Kirkuk Province on Thursday. The bomb blast in Anbar Province left residents shaken. Sabir Muhammad al-Rishawi, a shopkeeper who sells mobile phones, was close to the explosion. ''There were many people outside their homes because usually on Friday, you see a lot of activity in our area,'' he said. ''Then we saw a fuel tanker come close to the police checkpoint. The policemen shot at the driver and he exploded his truck to destroy the building close to the area he was trying to bomb. I felt my temperature start to rise and then we knew that there was chlorine in the bombs.'' Chlorine is widely available because it is used in water purification plants. Insurgents linked to Al Qaeda have become increasingly adept at stealing the chlorine, raiding water plants in the areas of Anbar that they control, said Colonel Dulaimi, the Anbar security chief. The chlorine is trucked from Jordan and Syria. Insurgents recently held up four chlorine trucks on the route to Water Ministry warehouses in Baghdad. As a result, Anbar officials stopped 12 other chlorine trucks that were in Trebil, near the Jordanian border. ''We've stopped these trucks from moving further into Anbar until we can prepare good protective convoy for them,'' Colonel Dulaimi said. Chlorine gas, first used in World War I, is a choking agent. There is no antidote for it. The only remedy is to try to remove it from clothes, skin and eyes with soap and water, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. If the exposure is limited, people generally survive without suffering lasting damage. The symptoms can be as slight as a burning in the lungs, coughing, tearing eyes and a burning sensation on the skin. Or they can be far more dire, destroying the delicate lung tissue and making people feel as if they are suffocating. Colonel Dulaimi said that even though the bomb destroyed a building with six apartments, the city was fortunate. ''God was helping families in Ramadi today, because the wind was blowing away from the residential area and toward an empty area,'' he said ''If the wind direction had not been like this, there would have been a huge tragedy in Ramadi today.''"
"Rahid Sabah Abid, a 25-year-old shop owner, left work on Wednesday afternoon and began his homeward journey on a day that seemed then much like any other. He wended his way through the crowded streets of the Shorja market, then boarded one of the minibuses waiting in the Sadriya neighborhood to take him home to his wife and five daughters in nearby Sadr City. His first hint of trouble was a car racing against traffic toward the line of buses. ''There was no warning,'' he recalled. ''I saw the explosion in front of me and felt the pain in my legs. The bus was on fire and I jumped out, then began to crawl. There were five burning cars with people in them. I shouted for someone to help.'' He recalled the car bombing, one of five bombings that killed at least 171 Iraqis on Wednesday, from a bed in Ali Abi Talib Hospital where he is recovering with one leg broken, the other badly burned. Around him, the well-worn beds held other Iraqis whose lives had been changed forever in a moment's flash of explosives and steel. Car bombs have become a near daily occurrence here and one of the defining features in this phase of the Iraq war. They claim the majority of civilian deaths and injuries, and they have become the most intractable challenge to the United States forces as they seek to turn Baghdad into a safe zone where normal life can be resumed. But in the Ali Abi Talib Hospital, normal still seemed far away. Over several hours on Thursday, as victims told their stories, no doctors or nurses were seen in the wards. Patients said there were only a few doctors for the entire hospital. Muhammad Ahmed Rahim lay bandaged and bleeding, his face and arms badly burned and shrapnel in his neck. Around 4 p.m. Wednesday, Mr. Rahim was driving his aunt Shukriya Ahmed Rahim and his cousin Adnan Ali through the Baghdad streets in his Opel Salon. As he approached Al Madofer Square, he saw a Toyota pickup truck shoot into the square and pull in front of a tanker truck carrying fuel. ''I saw a flash,'' he said. ''Then I jumped out of my car. I remember the doors were blown off. Shukriya and Adnan stayed in the car.'' His family members say he has asked repeatedly for his cousin and aunt. They will wait until he is stronger to tell him his passengers were killed in the explosion. In many countries, Rahim Kareem Himet would be lauded as a hero. In Iraq, he lies in a hospital bed with three bullet wounds. Mr. Himet was visiting a friend near Sadriya when the car bomb exploded. He ran to the scene with dozens of other passersby. ''I dragged the wounded away from the fire, I put them on handcarts and pushed them away from the scene,'' he says, his account confirmed by another patient wounded in the attack. ''I found a minibus nearby with no driver, we put 10 wounded in the back and I began to drive them to the hospital.'' As he neared the Babasher police station, about 100 yards from the blast site, soldiers that Mr. Himet says were Americans opened fire. He was wounded and crashed the bus in front of the police station. Iraqi soldiers were afraid to rescue him, he says, for fear the nervous American soldiers would shoot them, too. Bleeding badly, he was eventually taken to the hospital with the other victims he had tried to save. The Adnan family has no details of precisely what happened to their three sons on Wednesday. What they do know is that two are dead, and the third, 17-year-old Muntada, is in a coma with shrapnel lodged in his skull. Hussein el-Nashmi, a cousin, returned to his house that afternoon to the sound of women wailing. Passers-by had brought home the broken body of 13-year-old Mudrick, who was dead, as well as Muntada, who was still breathing. Mr. Nashmi rushed Muntada to the hospital, then began the search for the oldest brother, 19-year-old Mortada. ''We know he is dead,'' Mr. Nashmi said. ''We have searched every hospital in the city. We can't figure out which body is his. They are all burned so badly.'' Downstairs, a refrigerated trailer was parked in the hospital yard, its floor slick with blood, 18 blackened bodies sprawled about. ''I hope I die soon,'' Mr. Nashmi said. ''I don't want to see more friends die, or see my father and brother die. It will be better if I die first.'' Then he set off to pick through the carbonized bodies one more time. THE REACH OF WAR"
"A federal investigation into a 2005 gas explosion at a Bergenfield, N.J., apartment building that killed three people has found that Public Service Electric and Gas was partly to blame for the blast. The National Transportation Safety Board found that an excavation crew removing a 5,000-gallon fuel tank from a parking lot next to the three-story, 24-unit building caused the soil surrounding and supporting the gas main to shift, which in turn caused it to break. As a result, gas leaked into the basement of the building, at 30 Elm Street, the board said. The board said the utility failed ''to conduct effective oversight of the excavation and to be prepared to promptly shut off the flow of gas after the service line was damaged.'' In a statement, Jennifer Kramer, a company spokeswoman, said the utility disagreed with the report. ''We are confident that we did not in any way cause or contribute to this accident,'' Ms. Kramer said. ''We acted in accordance with our standards and consistent with good utility practices.'' In its findings, the board did not say exactly what sparked the explosion, which seriously injured five people and destroyed the building, leaving about 75 people homeless. In its final report, the board said that the Bergenfield Fire Department failed to evacuate the building ''despite the strong evidence of a gas leak'' and that this ''contributed to the casualties in the accident.'' After the explosion, on Dec. 13, 2005, John Pampaloni, then the fire chief, said he had an air monitor that could detect gas in the air, but did not use it because he did not smell gas or hear a hissing noise. Mayor Richard J. Bohan of Bergenfield, who defended Chief Pampaloni after intense scrutiny from residents and the local news media, did not respond to several telephone messages seeking comment yesterday. Several attempts by phone to reach Chief Pampaloni, who was also the town's public works supervisor, were unsuccessful. The three residents killed in the explosion were Nicolas Vargas, 78; Frank Smith, 76; and Somsak Vichitlakakran, 52. The safety board made recommendations to six agencies and companies involved in the explosion, including the utility company, the Bergenfield Fire Department and American Tank Service, the company excavating the oil tank."
"Living where we do, it can be hard to tell how ordinary our Sun is, shining dimly in our ordinary galaxy. Then comes something to remind us. This time it is a colossal supernova, called SN 2006gy, the brightest ever recorded. A supernova is an exploding star. This one, first observed last September, lies about 240 million light-years from us in the constellation Perseus. The explosion was perhaps 100 times more powerful than an ordinary supernova, and the star that exploded may have been 150 times the Sun's mass, ''freakishly massive,'' as one astronomer put it. A photograph of SN 2006gy shows that it vastly outshines the entire galaxy in which it is located. This takes some imagining. But so does the nature of the explosion itself, which puzzled observers at first. The usual explanations could not account for a supernova on this scale, nor was this the predictable demise of such a massive star. Instead, this anomalous explosion seems to offer a glimpse into one of the essential conditions for the universe we observe -- the dispersal of heavy elements like carbon and iron. What we are witnessing in SN 2006gy may be the making of the very atomic stuff out of which we ourselves are made. We are used to the notion that looking at the stars means looking back in time. Looking at SN 2006gy may mean looking at one of the fundamental processes in a much earlier universe. Astronomers point to an analogous star in our own galaxy, Eta Carinae, about 7,500 light-years away. It is similar in size, and similar in instability, to the star that turned, dying, into SN 2006gy. There is a possibility that Eta Carinae may itself die a similar, extraordinary death. It is perhaps unwise to hope for grand celestial events in one's lifetime. Stunning discoveries from the past should be enough. But it is tempting to wonder what such a nearby supernova, on such a scale, would be like, how it would be to live under such an altered sky. Editorial"
"The stark reality of the three-day battle in this seaside refugee camp became apparent Tuesday on a drive through the area during a brief but dangerous lull in the fighting. Bodies lay in the rubble-strewn streets, some unrecovered through three days of fighting. At the approach of a car, terrified Palestinians emerged from hiding, then scrambled for safety when snipers opened fire on them from various directions. A spontaneous demonstration against the fighting quickly ended when the demonstrators came under fire, leaving two dead and several others wounded. Soon the crackle of heavy machine-gun fire in the distance offered an ominous warning of impending attack, and minutes later mortar shells landed on a United Nations convoy delivering badly needed food and medical supplies. No one, it seemed, was safe from the violence. Three days after a police raid touched off a violent confrontation between the Lebanese Army and a militant Palestinian group, Fatah al Islam, the first clear look inside the camp on Tuesday presented stark reminders of Lebanon's bloody past. And ominous warnings from Palestinian groups in other camps as well as a suicide bombing in an apartment in Tripoli raised fears that the conflict could spread to other parts of the country and destabilize the already shaky government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora. Up to 40,000 Palestinians have been trapped inside Nahr al Bared with no water or electricity and dwindling supplies of food as the shelling has continued since Sunday, preventing aid groups from entering the camp. Even when aid did arrive on Tuesday afternoon, the convoy came under mortar fire. No one was injured in the attack, a United Nations official said, but three damaged trucks were abandoned as aid workers quickly evacuated the area. As the aid workers drove in, a stream of private cars took advantage of the calm as people scrambled out the camp, many carrying wounded women and children and waving white flags out their car windows. Snipers perched on a hill above the last stretch of road leading from the camp -- some belonging to Fatah al Islam, others to the army -- opened fire on the cars as they sped past, fleeing refugees said. In another lull on Tuesday night, thousands of Palestinians piled into cars and raced for the exit gates and presumed safety. Most drove to stay with relatives in the nearby Badawi camp about 10 miles away. ''It was worse than hell,'' said Yasmin Abdel Ain, who left the camp on Tuesday night. ''The army and Fatah al Islam would fire on each other, but the bombs and bullets landed on us. We were waiting for death.'' The fighting, the most serious of its kind in Lebanon since the end of the civil war in 1990, began Sunday when security officials raided a building in pursuit of bank robbers tied to Fatah al Islam. The raid quickly exploded into all-out warfare when men belonging to the group began attacking army outposts at the edges of the refugee camp. Early Tuesday, security men surrounded the same building in the center of Tripoli, where a suspected militant was believed to be hiding. But as the security forces closed in on him, he blew himself up, a senior security official said. ''This was terrorism, and no other group could have done what the man did,'' said a security official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. He said the Internal Security Forces had sealed the building after Sunday's fighting, but said the militant had apparently hidden in an apartment on another floor. In yet another reminder of Lebanon's bloody past, a group of young men in civilian clothing, carrying brand new M-16 rifles and ready to fight, arrived at one entrance to the camp on Tuesday afternoon and demanded that the army allow them to enter. After a brief scuffle, the army appeared to allow them to guard a nearby area, but strictly forbade them to enter. The Bush administration once again pointed to Syria as a source of the unrest, possibly to deflect attention from the United Nations investigation into the assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri, for which Syria has been blamed. ''We will not tolerate attempts by Syria, terrorist groups or any others to delay or derail Lebanon's efforts to solidify its sovereignty or to seek justice in the Hariri case,'' the White House spokesman, Tony Snow, said in a statement. The European Union foreign affairs chief, Javier Solana, in Beirut on Tuesday countered the administration's claims, saying he had seen no evidence of Syrian involvement. The conflict has tugged at Lebanon's fragile social fabric, inflaming already difficult relations between the Lebanese and the Palestinians. Many Lebanese see the Palestinians as a growing blight on their country, and blame them for harboring groups like Fatah al Islam. Some residents of Tripoli openly called for the army to destroy the camp altogether, insisting that the Palestinians be forced to move away. Palestinians, who already feel discriminated against, say the shelling and machine-gun fire appears to have targeted them, not just the militants. On Tuesday demonstrators at other refugee camps -- including Lebanon's largest, Ain el Hilwe, and the Rashidiye camp -- burned tires and chanted against the fighting, insisting, ''We will not let our Palestinian brothers be slaughtered,'' The Associated Press reported. Sultan Abu Aynayn, the leader of the Palestinian Fatah movement in Lebanon, speaking to reporters after concluding a meeting with Prime Minister Siniora, warned, ''If the random shelling does not stop, there will be uprisings in all the camps in Lebanon.'' Ali Arabi, who escaped from the camp with his family on Monday night, said the fighting was accomplishing nothing except killing the innocent. ''There can only be a political solution to this conflict,'' he said. ''Each shell that lands on the camp takes with it two or three people. If they intend to do this militarily, they will have to destroy the whole camp.'' Lebanon Asks U.S. for $280 Million WASHINGTON, May 22 (AP) -- Lebanon has asked the United States for $280 million in military assistance to help put down an uprising by Al Qaeda-inspired militants operating from a Palestinian refugee camp, the State Department said Tuesday. About $220 million would go to the Lebanese Armed Forces and another $60 million to security forces, said Sean McCormack, a State Department spokesman. He added that the United States was weighing the request."
"A lightning bolt was the likely cause of the Sago Mine explosion last year that killed 12 miners, a 16-month federal investigation has concluded. The report, issued Wednesday by the Mine Safety and Health Administration, is the fourth to say that lightning traveled more than two miles on the ground before igniting methane gas in an abandoned section of the mine. Two reports by the State of West Virginia and one by the mine's owner drew the same conclusion. There was, however, one new element in the federal report. It said that a section of old pump cable left in the mine allowed an electromagnetic pulse from the lightning to create an arc, touching off the explosion. Although he did not rule out other possible causes, Richard Stickler, the assistant secretary of labor for mine safety, called the lightning theory the ''most likely.'' While Mr. Stickler said at a news conference here that ''safety was not a top priority with this operation,'' he also said that none of the 149 safety violations found by investigators ''could be identified as the cause of the accident.'' The federal report drew an angry response from relatives of the victims. ''I can't tell where the coal company ends and M.S.H.A. begins,'' Deborah Hamner, the widow of a miner, George Hamner, said, referring to the mine agency. Some of the relatives, who are suing the owners of the mine, the International Coal Group, suggested that the lightning explanation is intended to help the company by supporting its argument that the blast resulted from an ''act of God.'' It will also help regulators avoid accountability, they said. Geraldine Bruso, who was among a group of relatives (and the sole survivor of the blast, Randal McCloy Jr.) who met with the federal officials before the news conference, called the report ''a waste of time.'' ''It could be lightning, but it's all theories right now,'' said Ms. Bruso, whose brother Jerry Groves died in the mine. ''You can probably go through the whole report and not get anything out of it.'' The United Mine Workers of America, which issued its own report in March that attributed the blast to a roof collapse or friction caused by falling rocks, also dismissed the new findings. Cecil E. Roberts, the president of the union, said in a statement that the federal agency's findings were ''far-fetched'' and ''unsupported by physical evidence found and examined in the mine.'' In its report, the agency said that a number of factors contributed to the accident, including slow response time, high levels of flammable methane gas inside a sealed-off section of the mine, and inadequately built seals used to close off the abandoned area. But the report added that even if the seals had complied with federal requirements, ''the forces generated by the explosion would have completely destroyed them.'' The accident, the nation's deadliest mining disaster in four decades, prompted state and federal officials to push for new mine safety laws. Congress eventually enacted measures requiring mining companies to provide extra oxygen to workers, and more rescue teams in case of accidents. Federal officials also announced an ''emergency temporary standard'' requiring that mine seals be built to withstand at least twice as much explosive force as is now required. The explosion occurred in January 2006 about 260 feet underground in a section of the mine that had been sealed off with foam blocks. The report noted that although the owner of the mine had apparently tried to remove all the cables from that section of the mine, it left behind a 1,300-foot piece. The report also raised the possibility that an unrecorded lightning strike occurred just above the sealed section."
"Six American soldiers and their interpreter were killed by a roadside bomb in western Baghdad on Saturday, the military said Sunday, in one of the deadliest single attacks against American troops in the capital in recent months. The soldiers, whose names were not released, had been searching for insurgent arms caches, the military said in a statement. A soldier assigned to the 13th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary), a supply unit, was killed Saturday when a bomb struck his armored vehicle near Diwaniya, south of Baghdad, the military said. Two soldiers were wounded in the attack. The deaths raised to 71 the number of American service members who have been killed this month. In April, the total was 104. An examination of casualty records on Iraq Coalition Casualty Count, an independent Web site that tracks such figures, indicated that the roadside bomb on Saturday caused the highest number of American troop deaths of any single bomb attack in Baghdad this year. Military officials warned that casualty rates were likely to remain high this summer, because more American troops are on the streets of Baghdad in an effort to tamp down sectarian violence and insurgent attacks in the capital. Since the beginning of the American-Iraqi effort to secure Baghdad in January, there have been numerous attacks that have caused multiple deaths. In January, a helicopter crash from insurgent fire killed 12 service members. Other attacks outside Baghdad have caused even more deaths. Two Iraqi Army soldiers died in western Baghdad on Sunday, an Interior Ministry official said -- one when a suicide bomber in a vehicle rammed an Iraqi Army convoy and the other when a car bomb detonated at a checkpoint. American troops killed eight suspected insurgents on Sunday, the military said -- six in an airstrike near Garma, in Anbar Province, and two southwest of Baghdad. A parked vehicle blew up near the Interior Ministry headquarters in central Baghdad, killing two people and wounding 10, the ministry official said. Later, a mortar shell landed in a commercial area in central Baghdad, wounding two people, the official said. In the Jihad neighborhood of southern Baghdad, American and Iraqi security forces clashed with Shiite militia members, the official said. Four insurgents and two policemen were killed in the fighting. In Ramadi, west of Baghdad, a truck bomb laden with chlorine exploded near a police checkpoint, killing 11 people, including 6 policemen, and wounding 22 others, said Maj. Ahmed Ali al-Alaiawi, a police official. Dr. Ammar Hammad, the director of al-Raed Hospital, confirmed the report and said 30 additional people were treated for respiratory problems caused by the chlorine used in the bomb, a tactic insurgents have begun using in recent months, apparently to increase casualties. ''Thank God the gas didn't waft to the nearby areas as there was no strong wind, so the damage was restricted to the area where the explosion happened,'' Dr. Hammad said. An American military spokesman said he had no information about a chlorine gas attack. In Samarra, north of Baghdad, seven bodies were found, the police said. In an open letter released Sunday, Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top American commander in Iraq, called for Iraqis to reject violence and embrace reconciliation. Noting that Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki took office a year ago this month, he said the government ''can point to some important accomplishments.'' ''All recognize, however, that much work remains to be done and the government's efforts over the coming months will be critical to whether or not this worthy effort succeeds,'' he added. Thousands of American soldiers on Sunday continued their search for three comrades captured in a May 12 ambush south of Baghdad. The Iraqi president, Jalal Talabani, flew to the United States on Sunday for a multiweek visit that his office said was for rest and for help in reducing his weight. His office denied local news media reports that Mr. Talabani was ill and said he was in general good health apart from his weight, The Associated Press reported. His extended departure comes at a time when the United States is pressing Iraqi politicians to make progress on a variety of measures. Another influential figure who may be out of Iraq for an extended period is Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, the leader of a powerful Shiite party, the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council, who is said to have left the country for medical treatment."
"Fierce clashes erupted between Lebanese Army soldiers and Islamic militants in the vicinity of a Palestinian refugee camp here on Sunday, leaving 22 Lebanese soldiers and 17 militants dead and dozens injured in one of the most significant challenges to the army since the end of Lebanon's bloody civil war. The confrontation with the Islamist group, Fatah al-Islam, raised fears of a wider battle to rout militants in the rest of Lebanon's 12 refugee camps, where radical Islam has been gaining in recent years. That, in turn, raised the possibility of a deadly conclusion to the crisis, placing strains on the embattled government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora. While anxious not to seem weak in the face of the militant challenge, military experts say, the government and the military also want to avoid any scenes that might draw comparisons to the Israeli attacks on Palestinian camps in the West Bank and Gaza. Many of the complex crosscurrents of Lebanon's politics were on display in the crisis. The army, under an agreement with the Palestinian leadership and Arab countries, was not allowed to enter the camp. Lebanese citizens, who hold the Palestinians responsible for sparking the civil war in 1975, cheered the army on the streets of Tripoli and outside the camp. Syria, which Lebanon accuses of backing Fatah al-Islam, closed several border crossings in the area. And the fighting broke out just as the Security Council had taken up a resolution to try suspects tied to the February 2005 assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri. Syria has been accused in previous investigations of ordering the killing, but vigorously denies any connection. Tensions rose further late Sunday night when a car bomb exploded in a nearly empty parking lot in a Christian section of eastern Beirut, killing one person, wounding 12 others and sparking fears of an orchestrated terrorist campaign. Last month, Lebanese authorities charged four members of Fatah al-Islam with bombing two commuter buses carrying Lebanese Christians in another Christian district. Fatah al-Islam has been a growing concern for security authorities in Lebanon and much of the region. Intelligence officials say it counts between 150 and 200 fighters in its ranks and subscribes to the fundamentalist precepts of Al Qaeda. The group's leader, Shakir al-Abssi, is a fugitive Palestinian and former associate of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the former leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia who was killed last year in Iraq. Both men were sentenced to death in absentia for the 2002 murder of an American diplomat, Lawrence Foley, in Jordan. In the six months since he arrived from Syria, Mr. Abssi has established a base of operations at the Nahr al Bared Palestinian refugee camp on the northern outskirts of this city, and the scene of the fighting on Sunday. What began as a raid on several homes in Tripoli in pursuit of suspected bank robbers connected to Fatah al-Islam quickly escalated into an open confrontation with the group at their stronghold in the camp. Three soldiers and four militants were killed in the early morning confrontation, said a Lebanese security official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Hours later, they said, militants tied to the group attacked an army patrol in the Koura region south of Tripoli, killing four more soldiers. The gunmen also attacked soldiers who were passing by unaware of the fighting, said Lebanon's information minister, Ghazi Aridi. The fighting raged throughout the afternoon at the camp, home to about 40,000 refugees, as army reinforcements rushed to the scene and tanks began shelling targets in the camp. Militants who had taken positions around the outskirts of the camp fired back, keeping the army at bay. Four children and three women were injured in the shelling, said one medical official, who requested anonymity because his organization forbids members from speaking to the news media. But residents inside the camp, reached by telephone, said at least two civilians had been killed and more than 45 had been injured in the shelling. There was no independent verification of the residents' claims. By nightfall, the army had regained control of several outposts surrounding the camp, but the siege of the camp continued. Soldiers manned checkpoints in the area and filled the streets late Sunday night and armored personnel carriers rumbled through the city. Many residents of Tripoli welcomed the army into town, and onlookers clapped whenever tanks fired shells into the camp, bringing to the surface longstanding tensions between Lebanese and Palestinians. ''This should have happened from the start,'' said one man, who stood in a crowd of onlookers as the tanks fired into the camp. The crowd shouted, ''God is great, and God protect the army,'' with each shell fired. ''We wish the government would destroy the whole camp and the rest of the camps,'' said another in the crowd, Ahmad al-Marooq. ''Nothing good comes out of the Palestinians.'' But military experts said a direct assault on the camps would be a grave mistake. ''We cannot afford to have that here,'' said Elias Hanna, a retired army general, who warned against a direct assault. ''This is not a question of the army's capabilities or its professionalism. You simply can't send the army into the camps to arrest 200 people without paying a heavy price in civilian casualties.'' Residents of the camp said that water and electricity had been cut off, and that an effort to convince the militants to hold their fire to allow the Red Cross to evacuate injured civilians collapsed because the Lebanese Army said it could not guarantee the medics' security. Lebanon's 400,000 Palestinians remain among the most downtrodden refugees in the Arab world, enjoying few rights and facing strict restrictions on the kind of work they can do. Most are limited to menial, low-paying jobs and face significant prejudices. Some refugee camps, in turn, have become fertile ground for growing militancy, especially focused against Israel. In recent years the ranks of religious militants bent on a broader jihad have swelled, as some have traveled to Iraq to join the insurgency there and, more recently, have returned to establish movements of their own within the camps. ''The army will not be able to defeat them,'' said Ahmad Skaff, 20, who lives near the camp, and who said he watched the militants gather outside the camp early Sunday, carrying rocket propelled grenades and other heavy weaponry, ready for a fight. ''They are fearless; they will slaughter the army.'' The bomb in Beirut exploded just before midnight on Sunday in a parking lot behind a towering shopping mall called ABC and next to a multilevel garage. There was no clear target, though it may have been aimed at moviegoers who sometimes leave the mall around midnight. But the lot was relatively empty at the time of the bombing. The explosion shattered the windows of apartment buildings and stores for blocks around. Fire trucks and police vehicles inched their way through the crowded, narrow streets toward the site. Lebanese soldiers in berets and green camouflage fatigues pushed back hundreds of people trying to shove their way into the area, many snapping photos with their cell phones. ''We thought the building had collapsed because it was so strong,'' said Hamid Saliba, 39, as he and his wife gingerly stepped through the debris of her mother's apartment, just a few hundred feet from the blast site. A painting of Jesus Christ hung askew on a wall.

"A fiery explosion with plumes of black smoke shattered a chemical unit at the huge BP oil refinery in Texas City near Galveston on Wednesday afternoon, killing at least 14 people and injuring more than 100, the authorities said. ''There are still some people who are not accounted for,'' Don Parus, the refinery manager, said Wednesday night, hours after the fire was reported to be extinguished. Mr. Parus said that the cause was not yet determined but that the explosion occurred in an isomerization unit, which raises the octane level of gasoline. Camille Dass, a BP spokeswoman, said foul play was not suspected. Fire engines and police cars roared in and out of the plant, and medical helicopters swooped in on evacuation missions. ''When a chopper would come in, another would take off,'' said Sgt. Tim Zaragoza of the Texas City Fire Department. ''It looked like a small war zone of bodies being loaded up.'' The plant, BP's largest in the nation, has 1,800 employees, is spread over 1,200 acres and refines 460,000 barrels of crude oil a day. It is considered ''the most complex facility in the world,'' said another company spokesman, Hugh Depland. The plant is still operating. Almost a year ago, on March 31, 2004, a series of explosions rocked the refinery, with no reported loss of life. In April 1947, Texas City was the site of the country's worst accident when ammonium nitrate stored in two ships docked at the port exploded, nearly obliterating Texas City and claiming at least 576 lives. In the wake of Wednesday's explosion, a seven-member investigation team from the United States Chemical Safety Board was scheduled to arrive at the site Thursday. John S. Breland, a board member, called it ''a very serious accident'' and described the situation as ''very bad.'' Neil Chapman, a BP spokesman, said the plant had been shut down for its annual major maintenance, a process called ''turnaround,'' and it was gradually being brought back on stream when the explosion occurred. Industry experts pointed out that explosions at refineries have usually happened during the turnaround, when processes are in flux, rather than when a unit is fully up. The plant is supplied by pipeline and ship, mainly with oil from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, Mr. Chapman said. ''This will have a huge impact on the plant,'' said Annie Smith, a spokeswoman for BP America in Houston. ''But it won't shut it down.'' BP said that although the explosion sent up big black clouds of smoke, people who lived near the refinery were not asked to evacuate and no toxic substances were released into the air by the explosion. The company said it was trying to account for the whereabouts of all 1,800 employees, who work at the plant in two shifts. The company so far does not think that the explosion was caused by terrorism or foul play but cautioned that it was far too early to draw any conclusions. ''There will be a long and intensive investigation to determine the cause of the explosion,'' Ms. Smith said. ''But we don't believe it to be an act of terrorism. So that leaves something in the operation of the plant.'' Mark Baxter, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said of the potential impact that with oil prices so high, supplies so tight and refineries running at very high capacity, the explosion would probably bump prices of oil and gasoline higher in the short term. ''The magnitude of the impact today is greater than it would have been 10 years ago,'' Mr. Baxter said, ''because we are in such a tight, volatile market.'' John Koloen, a spokesman for University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, said: ''We've treated 22 people. We have 3 listed in critical condition, 3 listed in serious condition and 16 listed in fair condition.'' As for the the nature of the injuries, he said he had ''no specific information.'' But he added, ''It runs the gamut of everything from burns to scrapes and bruises and stuff.'' Mr. Koloen added, ''We received our first patient about 20 minutes after the explosion.'' He also said Mainland Hospital in Texas City and Clear Lake Regional Hospital received some patients. The blast rattled windows as far away as Galveston, about 20 miles across the bay, and the Clear Lake area around the Johnson Space Center. BP set up an emergency telephone number for relatives to call for updates on the injured, and it called in extra staff members to provide support services. Mr. Depland of BP said it had not been determined how many of the dead were killed in the blast and fire or how many died later from their injuries. Some of the injured were treated and released, he said."
"An explosion caused by a ruptured natural gas line ripped through a pet store in a strip mall in Monmouth County on Friday, injuring five people who were trapped in the building when its roof collapsed, the authorities said. Construction workers installing electrical lines were digging trenches in the parking lot of the strip mall across the street from the Monmouth Mall about 11:30 a.m. when they accidentally severed a buried natural gas line, said Capt. George Jackson of the Eatontown police. As the volatile fumes filled the air and drifted into a Petco store nearby, the store manager urged customers and employees to flee the building. Within minutes, the gas ignited, setting off a thundering blast that demolished the building's rear wall, blew out plate glass windows and caused a large portion of the roof to cave in. Four store employees and a construction worker were buried. Alison Hazelet, a Petco worker, said she was grooming a Shih Tzu named Cuddles when the store manager warned employees to leave immediately. ''I just grabbed the dog and ran out,'' she said. ''As soon as we got out, the whole building blew up. The ground was shaking, and there was the sound of glass breaking. I was really scared.'' Ms. Hazelet and the Shih Tzu, the only dog in the store at the time, were not hurt. Dozens of firefighters, emergency workers and police officers converged on the scene, and a rescue crew from Fort Dix used specially trained dogs to locate the people trapped inside. By 2:30 p.m., the last two victims had been freed from the rubble, said Sgt. Albert M. Ponenti of the New Jersey State Police. Michael Bescom of the Monmouth County emergency medical service said that all the victims were conscious when they were rescued and were in stable condition after being taken to local hospitals. He said their injuries were not life-threatening. . After helping the people trapped by the explosion, rescuers started evacuating the hundreds of animals inside. Officers from local animal rescue agencies and volunteers from other nearby pet stores shuttled in and out of the battered building to retrieve animals. They used plastic crates and glass aquariums to transport reptiles and small rodents. The fish presented a harder problem because many of the glass containers had been shattered by the explosion and falling debris. As rescuers hurried out of the building in the late afternoon, Ira Hayes, an officer for the Monmouth County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, shouted for more equipment. ''We need buckets, pails, anything,'' said Mr. Hayes, as one rescuer carried a clown fish in a plastic container and poured it into a picnic cooler serving as an aquarium. Chief Victor Amato of the Monmouth society said that by late afternoon, rescuers had brought out a parade of animals, including 3 ferrets, 3 chinchillas, 10 rats, 300 mice, 10 gerbils, 40 geckos, 20 frogs and one tree anole. No cats were in the building at the time of the explosion. But as many as 100 birds were still trapped last night in a section of the store covered by a mound of rubble. Rescuers said at least some were alive. ''We've lost a few fish,'' Chief Amato said, ''but we're hoping to get those birds out alive.'' Correction: March 18, 2005, Friday An article on March 5 about an explosion at a pet store in Eatontown, N.J., in which five people were injured mispelled the surname of an emergency medical service official involved in the rescue effort. He is Michael Bascom, not Bescom."
"In the charred remains of an apartment yesterday, a blackened bicycle was tossed into the corner. A pile of silver-blue Buddhist bracelets and scattered metal meditation balls were among the few surviving items from the family's sales booth on Canal Street. The couple had worked together at the cramped booth, selling purses, scarves and jewelry, for eight or nine years. They opened at 9:30 a.m., and closed by 7 p.m. One neighboring vendor, Mohammed Hossein, said, ''They always smiled. I never knew they had internal problems.'' But on Wednesday, three members of the family were dead and two were in Bellevue Hospital Center. On Wednesday night, the husband, identified by the police as Lun Bao Zheng, 44, attacked the family with a gun and a knife and set two fires, officials said. The flames ignited butane tanks in the apartment, on the 21st floor of a building on the Lower East Side, and an explosion followed. A .22-caliber gun was recovered at the scene, the police said. The wife, registered at the hospital as Chou Yian Chen, 43, and her nephew escaped, but her son and her niece, as well as her husband, were found dead inside. Friends and neighbors said money was a source of tension in the family, and that Ms. Chen paid her husband a salary. He rode an old bicycle and brought fruits and vegetables home from Chinatown in the basket, neighbors said. Mr. Zheng's death was ruled a suicide. The medical examiner's office said he died from smoke inhalation and burns. The two other deaths were ruled homicides. Ms. Chen's son, identified by the police as Jin Ji Ya, 19, died of gunshot wounds; his heart and lungs were perforated. His name was listed in state motor vehicle files as Jun J. Xu. The niece, identified by the police as Xao Ying Chan, 27, died of smoke inhalations and burns. Ms. Chen suffered a cut to her head and gunshot wound to her body, and her nephew, Chen Da Chan, 29, suffered two gunshot wounds. They were listed in stable condition last night at Bellevue. Mr. Zheng was from Hong Kong. Ms. Chen was from Guangzhou, China. Christie Xia, who worked next to the family's booth on Canal Street, said that Ms. Chen married Mr. Zheng to get a green card. She brought her son, who was from a previous marriage, to New York several years ago, her nephew about a year ago, and her niece a few months ago, friends said. They all worked at the booth on Canal Street, though neighbors said Mr. Zheng stopped working a few weeks ago. The fire that destroyed their apartment at 87 Columbia Avenue in the Masaryk Towers took 100 firefighters to put out. Anthony Watkins, a security guard at the building, said he rushed upstairs to the 21st floor after he encountered a bloody Ms. Chen and her nephew in the elevator. There was already smoke when he arrived to bang on the door, he said. ''The smoke turned from white to black,'' he said. ''We heard an explosion. There was a boom.'' Then he was thrown back by the force, he said."
"Earnest Olvey was cleaning up a job at the BP refinery here Wednesday when, he said, ''all of a sudden I heard two little pops.'' He turned to see flames some 100 feet away and started to run. That, he said Thursday from his hospital bed in Galveston, was when his world exploded, sending him flying. One of the hundred or so contractors injured in the nation's worst refinery accident in 10 years, he was one of the lucky ones, said Mr. Olvey, 39, a heavy equipment operator. Fifteen other workers died in the blast and fire, the last victim found in the rubble a day a day later. The medical examiner said the force of the blast was so great that everyone who perished either died instantly or was knocked unconscious. Only a handful of victims could be easily identified. Mary Jane Walker of Texas City said her nephew, Steven, 34, had been working in the plant when the explosion hit 50 yards away and threw him 70 yards. He was in the intensive care unit at Mainland Medical Center in Texas City, Ms. Walker said. ''He says he remembers it all,'' she said. ''He turned around and looked and saw water or whatever it was coming out. He knew he was in trouble. ''It was no more than five seconds before it blew. It blew his clothes off him. Everything but his underwear and his boots.'' The 47,000 residents in this boomtown are used to walking with danger, many say. They share the Galveston bayfront with no fewer than eight sprawling petrochemical refineries, mini-cities of gleaming pipes and spindly towers. Its port, the nation's third largest in tonnage handled, is thronged with tankers. And it holds the tragic record as site of the country's worst industrial accident, a ship explosion in 1947 that all but wiped Texas City off the map. So when a furious wind rushed like a tornado through Texas City on Wednesday afternoon followed by booms that knocked tiles off the ceiling and shattered glass doors, residents went into practiced crisis mode for a Level 3 emergency. Schools were locked down and officials streamed to the crisis operations center. No one needed to wait for the sirens to sound, said Bobby Gervais, the city attorney, who felt the blast and looked up to see a giant fireball. He and others ran to the crisis center. Melissa Tortorici, a schools spokeswoman, was at a meeting in a bank and thought at first that someone had blown the vault, she said. Texas City's eight schools, with 6,000 students, invoked an automatic ''shelter in place'' plan, keeping children inside and shutting off ventilation systems to avoid spreading any fumes, Ms. Tortorici said. Stella Aquilar, a tax preparer at Insta-Cash, a few blocks from the BP plant, said she had felt the tornado-like wind and heard the booms and ran outside to see a massive rolling plume of thick black smoke rising from the plant. Ms. Aquilar jumped in her car and sped to the elementary school a few blocks away to fetch her three children. After grabbing them from their classrooms, she raced to leave the school, only to have an assistant principal lock the doors as shell-shocked parents raced through the hallways in search of their own children. Ms. Aquilar said she had watched as a fuming father locked outside began punching the glass. Failing to break all the way through, the man ran around the side and tried to kick another door down. After 15 minutes, the doors were unlocked. At the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, seven miles across the bay, Dr. Brian S. Zachariah, director of the emergency room where 23 of the injured were taken by helicopter and ambulance, said that eight people remained in extremely critical condition, some with burns over 90 percent of the body. Mr. Olvey, who was recuperating in a room there, said he had escaped with just bruises and hoped to be out in a day or so. As federal and state investigators began interviewing witnesses from the site, an isomerization unit that makes components used to raise the octane level of gasoline, the chief executive officer of London-based BP, Lord John Browne, rushed here and toured the site with plant officials Thursday morning. A company investigation has also begun, he said. At a news conference the Texas City Hall, Lord Browne called it ''the worst tragedy that I've known'' in 38 years with the company. He said that company officials were not sure what had happened, but that the blast had come as the company was bringing that part of the refinery back on line after a shutdown for ''routine maintenance.'' Allan Jamail, an official with Pipefitters Union Local 211 in Houston, was quick to point to nonunion labor as the problem. Mr. Jamail said that refineries across Texas had become more dangerous as companies increasingly turned to nonunion contractors to do difficult construction and maintenance work. He said nonunion workers ''aren't as well-trained'' and did not have the job security to raise safety concerns with managers. BP officials said that all 15 workers killed were believed to have been contractors, not BP employees. The morning before the blast, 2,200 of the 3,300 workers at the plant were contractors, they said. BP officials denied that using contractors might hurt safety. At the news conference, Lord Browne was asked about the plant's past safety problems. The safety record, he said, ''has improved enormously.'' Earlier this month, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed a fine of $109,500 against the refinery for an incident last September in which two workers were killed by superheated steam. The company is contesting the fine. Last August, the agency proposed a fine of $63,000 for 14 serious violations; BP eventually settled for a payment of $13,000 and an agreement to make changes at the plant. Lord Browne promised that there would be ''no stone left unturned in making sure events are investigated and that remediation is done.'' He said the explosion, though massive, would have only a negligible effect on the output of the entire refinery, which supplies about 3 percent of the nation's gasoline and other refined products. In Pasadena, Calif., the Jacobs Engineering Group, whose subsidiary JE Merit Constructors was the employer of 11 of the victims, said that in all 375 of its workers were involved in turnaround work at a separate unit close to the blast. Karen McCormick, the on-scene coordinator for the Environmental Protection Agency, said that neither a special toxin-detecting jet aircraft that flew over the site of the blast an hour after it happened nor ground crews that arrived later Wednesday afternoon had discovered emissions of any harmful agents. Three separate investigations were in various stages. BP-Amoco itself was said to be bringing in experts from other refineries to figure out what happened. OSHA was also on scene. A third investigation is being conducted by the United States Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, an independent agency modeled after the National Transportation Safety Board."
"A manhole exploded in Queens yesterday, injuring five people in a sport utility vehicle and causing extensive power outages for about an hour, the police said. The blast, at about 5 p.m. at the intersection of Merrick and Farmers Boulevards in Springfield Gardens, was apparently caused by an electrical malfunction or fire below the street, the police said. Power was restored at about 6 p.m. to an area of some 1.5 square miles in Springfield Gardens and St. Albans, they said. The five people were injured in the explosion when the manhole cover beneath their Lincoln Navigator hit the undercarriage of the S.U.V. while it was stopped at a traffic light, the police said. Lieutenant Matthew Tavaglia Jr. said that the occupants, three children and two adults, were taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center and that their injuries did not appear to be life-threatening. Ohin Quam, 56, an attendant at a service station across Merrick Boulevard, said the explosion was so loud ''my heart leapt into my chest.'' He said that ''the ground shook and people started running'' but that Fire Department and Con Edison crews began arriving within minutes."
"Three men were killed and another critically injured in an industrial gas explosion on Tuesday that destroyed part of a warehouse, briefly blackened the sky near an industrial area here known as ''the chemical coastline,'' and could be heard miles away. The victims were moving acetylene, a highly flammable fuel used in welding torches, from large canisters to small ones at a loading dock of the Acetylene Service Company on State Street when the blast occurred at 10:43 a.m., said Larry Cattano, the Perth Amboy fire chief. Two workers, Enio Perez, 34, and Pablo Morillo, 29, were killed instantly. Another, German Gonzalez Vasquez, 46, was airlifted to University Hospital in Newark, where he died soon afterward. Each was killed, said Mr. Cattano, by the trauma of the blast. None were burned, including Jiovai Pena Gomez, who was injured in the blast and was in critical condition last night at Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center in New Brunswick. Victims' relatives, many of them screaming and crying as they gathered at the scene, said on Tuesday that the tragedy highlighted the harsh dangers faced daily by the site's 14 employees. Fear of catastrophe among the workers is ever-present, they said, but because acetylene jobs pay more than retail or factory work, many choose to toil with the risk. Joselito Perez, 21, said that his brother Enio took the job after his wife died in 1999, leaving him to care for five children ages 6 to 11. The danger, he said, mattered less than the payoff. ''He was a person who was working hard to get a better life for him and his kids,'' Mr. Perez said. ''He worked hard every day, then on the weekends he did the laundry and food shopping and he'd buy the kids toys and clothes.'' Mr. Morillo, who would have turned 30 on Wednesday, had family concerns, too. Stephen Morillo, who appeared at the scene with other victims' family members, said that his little brother was expecting a baby with his new wife, Wanda. All the technicians and employees ''risk their lives to work there every day,'' said Mr. Morillo, who worked at the plant until 1997. ''The pay is good, but it's dangerous.'' As of 4:45 p.m. on Tuesday, the scene was under control. The bodies of those who died remained on the ground, while those not critically injured were taken to local hospitals for treatment of emotional trauma. Part of the 200-by-200-foot building had been destroyed, and fire officials ruled it condemned. The damage, however, could have been worse. Three truck beds filled with about 150 acetylene canisters each stood nearby, intact. Chief Cattano said that the building's sprinkler system worked well, and when fire officials arrived on the scene, no flames could be seen. The cause of the blast, he said, remains under investigation. Karen Hershey, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, said that preliminary evidence pointed to a leak from the hoses that connected one of the large canisters to a smaller cylinder. But the gas, which is used welding torches and carries a slight odor of garlic, requires little to explode. According to the United States Department of Labor, ''The static charge developed by walking across a carpet floor on a dry day can be 1,700 times greater than that needed to ignite acetylene.'' Companies handling the fuel are monitored by a quilt of federal and state government agencies. Officials with Acetylene Service, whose parent company, Acetylene Supply Company of Woodbridge, brings in about $6 million a year, did not return calls seeking comment Tuesday. The company's facilities have been inspected three times in the past eight years by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. In each case, there were violations, and the company paid fines that a representative of the agency described as ''less than significant.'' After an inspection in February 1996, the company paid $5,850 in penalties for 17 violations, including one related to equipment maintenance. ''We cited them for not establishing written procedures to maintain the integrity of their process equipment,'' said Robert D. Kulik, area director for OSHA. ''In other words, one of the components -- storage tanks, piping, valves, relief and vent systems, emergency shutdown systems, -- were deficient, or there was no written procedure for maintaining them.'' Later that year, the company paid $600 for violations related to their written safety procedures, and March 2002, the company paid $563 for a problem with the use of a confined space. ''It's not clear whether any of these violations were related to what caused the explosion today,'' Mr. Kulik said. For those who live and work near the site, the explosion provided a sudden reminder of acetylene's chemical force. Only a few months ago, in October, Giles Lison, 27, was killed when a leaky cylinder of the fuel exploded in the back seat of his Volkswagen while he was driving on Hackensack Road in Weehawken, N.J. Miguel Taveras, who works at an auto repair shop across the street on State Street, said Tuesday's fatal blast felt like an earthquake. ''The ground shook and I saw debris flying through the air, then I felt the wind blast, wind pressure. It was powerful.''"
"An explosion from a leak in a gas line destroyed two homes and badly damaged two others here on Sunday morning, authorities said. A couple who lived in one home were critically injured, and their daughter was in serious condition. Edward Sanchez, 18, said he was watching television shortly after 3 a.m. when he heard the blast and saw flames shooting from a nearby house, at 744 Lehigh Avenue, a thoroughfare near Kean University with modest single-family homes on one side and warehouses on the other. Mr. Sanchez said he immediately smelled gas and woke his mother and sister. Together they fled their house, at 752 Lehigh, and once outside, saw their neighbors running from 744 Lehigh, which was partially collapsed and engulfed in flames. Mr. Sanchez said the fire quickly spread to the house next door, 748 Lehigh, which firefighters quickly evacuated. Then a second, larger explosion rocked the neighborhood, sending debris flying up to 300 feet. The house at 748 burst into flames and exploded. ''It literally blew the roof off of the house and flipped it upside down,'' said the chief of the Union Fire Department, Frederic Fretz. Firefighters got the fire under control a few hours later. The explosions also severely damaged Mr. Sanchez's house and the one at 740 Lehigh, which was unoccupied. The couple who were badly injured, Charmaine Thomas, 40, and her husband, Ferdinand, live at 744 Lehigh Avenue, which also was destroyed. Both were listed in critical condition at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston. Mrs. Thomas had second- and third-degree burns to her back, face and right arm. Her husband had cuts, bruising and burns after he jumped from the second story with the couple's daughter, Samantha, to escape the flames. The daughter was listed in serious condition with cuts and smoke inhalation. Fire officials said that several residents, including the Thomas family, told firefighters that shortly before the blasts, they had noticed a strong smell of natural gas inside their homes. ''The area was rich with gas,'' Chief Fretz said. ''These explosions are not totally uncommon, but we were fortunate that there weren't more injuries.'' Chief Fretz said two firefighters suffered were slightly injured while fighting the blasts, which sent thick black smoke into the frigid sky. Officials from Elizabethtown Gas clamped the gas line in the neighborhood and shut off service to seven homes and four businesses, said Martha J. Monfried, a utility spokeswoman. By Sunday afternoon, gas had been restored to all except the four damaged homes as state and county investigators combed the scene for evidence. Bundled in a blanket and an oversized ski cap, Mercedes Raime, 34, stood in the middle of the road and stared at the smoldering pile of debris at 748 Lehigh Avenue, where she had lived for the past month with her husband, Raul Tinco. ''They just moved here, it was their first home and now it's completely ruined,'' said Edward Ayala, 35, a family friend. . Mr. Ayala said the couple had moved to the two-story home from the Bronx and lost everything in the blast. ''They are just in shock and just can't believe that their entire life, what was in that house, is now gone,'' Mr. Ayala said. ''They are thankful that they were not seriously injured, but they are devastated by this loss.''"
"Eric Robert Rudolph, the former fugitive who evaded capture in the North Carolina mountains for more than five years, has agreed to plead guilty to bombings that killed two people and injured more than 150 others at abortion clinics and at the 1996 Olympics here, the Department of Justice said on Friday. As part of his plea agreement, Mr. Rudolph revealed the whereabouts of more than 250 pounds of dynamite and of a buried bomb more than twice as powerful as the one that went off here in Centennial Olympic Park, the authorities said. The explosives were recovered and disposed of this week. In exchange for the information, Mr. Rudolph, 38, will serve life in prison instead of facing possible execution. His lawyers did not return calls seeking comment. The surprise announcement came two days after preliminary jury selection began in what was to be Mr. Rudolph's first trial, for a 1998 bombing at a Birmingham abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police officer and maimed a nurse. Prosecutors had believed that the Birmingham bombing was their strongest case. Mr. Rudolph was also charged for bombings outside a family planning clinic and a gay club in Atlanta in 1997. After the bombing in Birmingham, authorities identified him as a witness. But he fled, evading bloodhounds, heat sensors and even volunteer paramilitary brigades for five years before being caught apparently scavenging food behind a grocery store in Murphy, N.C., in 2003. For a time, Mr. Rudolph's success as a fugitive reframed the conflict, from criminal vs. the law to local boy vs. federal intruders. It made him a celebrated underdog, with T-shirts being sold bearing the phrases ''Run Rudolph Run'' and ''Hide and Seek Champion.'' Meanwhile, his victims struggled to recover from the trauma of shrapnel wounds, cracked bones and blinded eyes from bombs spiked with nails and screws. Emily Lyons, the nurse left half-blind and hobbled by the Birmingham explosion, and Jeffrey, her husband, initially resisted the plea agreement but softened their stance because of the hidden dynamite. ''I watched what my wife went through,'' Mr. Lyons said. ''I did not want to have somebody come to me and say, 'My mother looks like your wife because you held out for the sentence you wanted.''' Had it not been for the dynamite, Ms. Lyons said, she would never have been able to accept the plea. ''The crime deserves the punishment of death,'' she said. ''He killed two people directly, killed one indirectly, killed all the lives that we had at that time. So death to me is the appropriate punishment.'' Authorities concluded that it was worth forgoing a potential death sentence to find the explosives, which they believed were a serious threat to public safety, said a government official who declined to give his name because of the nature of the plea negotiations. With Mr. Rudolph's cooperation, according to the Justice Department announcement, the dynamite was found in several places in western North Carolina, where Mr. Rudolph camped while on the run. Officers also unearthed a fully constructed bomb containing 20 to 25 pounds of dynamite and a detached detonator that had been hidden ''in close proximity to a road, homes and businesses,'' the announcement said. ''The deal was contingent on them finding it,'' Mr. Lyons said. The authorities said that the hidden explosives could be dangerous even without a detonating device, because dynamite destabilizes as it ages. Dr. Van Romero, an explosives expert at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, said there had been numerous cases in which children came across old dynamite sticks and set them off merely by moving them. ''The nitroglycerine in the dynamite actually starts to crystallize,'' Dr. Romero said, ''and when that happens, it's very, very unstable.'' Law enforcement officials involved in the hunt for Mr. Rudolph praised the plea deal. ''It shocked me,'' said Kent B. Alexander, who was the United States attorney in Atlanta during the bombings and is now general counsel at Emory University. ''From everything I know about Rudolph, it seemed like he was the type who hated the federal government so bad he would never do anything to admit his guilt. So whatever the authorities did to get him to plea was masterful.'' But Woody Enderson, a retired F.B.I. inspector who led the Rudolph investigation, said he had predicted that Mr. Rudolph would plead to avoid possible execution. ''There are some people that probably would find a lifetime in prison very, very difficult,'' Mr. Enderson said. ''But I just believe that Mr. Rudolph was such a loner, and was so comfortable just with himself -- and in reality for five years he was in his own prison -- that it would not be the hardship for him that it would be for other people.'' Mr. Rudolph has agreed to plead guilty in federal court in Birmingham on Wednesday and, later the same day, in federal court in Atlanta, the Justice Department said. He will serve multiple life sentences with no possibility of parole. The Birmingham bombing in 1998 was one of the last in a decade of extreme anti-abortion activity. In the 1990's, hit lists of abortion providers were posted on the Internet, and a manual circulated that included instructions on how to amputate doctors' thumbs. A rash of killings of abortion providers ended with the death of Dr. Barnett Slepian in Amherst, N.Y., in 1998. Mr. Rudolph, who moved with his family from Florida to North Carolina after his father died when he was a teenager, became emblematic of a link between white supremacists, antigovernment sentiment and the anti-abortion movement. In ninth grade he wrote an essay arguing that the Holocaust never happened. For a time in his teenage years, his mother took him to Missouri to live with a religious sect called Christian Identity, which opposes abortion, homosexuality and interracial marriage. With his two brothers, Mr. Rudolph worked in North Carolina as a carpenter and also sold marijuana, family members have said. In pretrial motions in Birmingham, his lawyers asked to present expert testimony about western Carolina culture. ''Rudolph's retreat to the wilderness in the face of being sought by federal law enforcement is consistent with the cultural values, principles and lifestyles of some of those in the region,'' they said, which include ''strong community ties coupled with an independent spirit; living off the land; preservation of individual privacy and freedom; and a persistent mistrust and suspicion of government.'' The bombings were accompanied by letters claiming that they were the work of the ''Army of God,'' which people who study hate groups say is not a real organization but a name that has been claimed by people acting independently. Mr. Rudolph was not connected with any of the bombings until the one in Birmingham, when a truck seen leaving the scene was traced to him. By the time the authorities reached his mobile home in North Carolina, he had disappeared. Investigators have described the Birmingham bombing as the cruelest, because the bomb was not on a timer. Instead, Mr. Rudolph chose the exact moment to set it off, watching as Robert Sanderson, the clinic security guard and an off-duty policeman, leaned close to the bomb. In the Olympic bombing, Alice Hawthorne was killed and 111 people were wounded. A security guard, Richard A. Jewell, was identified as a suspect but was later cleared. Many victims are now involved in lawsuits seeking damages for their injuries, emotional scars or financial devastation. Several said they were glad the case was being resolved. Memrie Creswell, 36, whose right shoulder was pierced by a four-inch nail from a bomb planted by Mr. Rudolph in 1997 at the Otherside Lounge, an Atlanta club frequented by gay men and lesbians, said she was pleased that Mr. Rudolph would not be eligible for parole. ''I don't want him ever walking the streets again,'' Ms. Creswell said. Dana Ford, a co-owner of the club, said business plummeted after the bombing, forcing her and her partner, Beverly McMahon, to close it in 2001. She said she was glad Mr. Rudolph would receive a life sentence, because she believed that the death penalty would have turned him into a martyr among his supporters. Linda Bourgeois, the administrator of the New Woman All Women abortion clinic where the Birmingham bombing took place, said the clinic staff was ''very happy'' when they learned of the plea. ''I think it says to other people that if you bomb us, we're going to get you in the end,'' Ms. Bourgeois said."
"Edna Briant, 87, marveled that the bus was so big and luxurious and that there was so much to see along the way. ''As tired as I was, I wanted to stay awake,'' Miss Briant said, ''because it was like going on a tour passing all those Wal-Marts and McDonald's.'' She was seated in the second row, next to her sister, Claire, 84, both evacuating this Houston suburb as Hurricane Rita approached, just two weeks after they fled New Orleans and the rising waters of Hurricane Katrina. In the row behind them was Harry Reynolds, 68, an amputee, who used a vacant seat to elevate what was left of his right leg. A few rows back sat 68-year-old Natalie Lenzner, who had terminal brain cancer, settling in for what would prove to be a 15-hour ride to Dallas. The Briant sisters and Mr. Reynolds would survive a deadly explosion, ignited by oxygen canisters, that left the bus a charred husk and became a defining image of Hurricane Rita. Mrs. Lenzner would perish, one of 23 frail residents of a home for the aged who died escaping a hurricane that, as fate would have it, killed nobody in the Houston area except those running from its predicted fury. Who lives and who dies in a disaster is often a matter of happenstance, and so it was for the people on this bus, all residents of Brighton Gardens, owned by Sunrise Senior Living, a company based in Virginia. But here, the destiny of these passengers, so dependent on others, was determined by many people who planned for them. Local emergency officials urged the nursing home to evacuate. The governor of Texas waived normal regulations to put more buses on the road. Family members either followed the advice of Brighton Gardens' administrator to take their loved ones home or they made other plans, perhaps because their own houses were in the path of the storm. Sixty-one residents removed by their families did just fine, and 16 others were safely evacuated to Arlington, Tex. But 37 with special medical needs -- the Briant sisters, Mr. Reynolds and Mrs. Lenzner among them -- were put on a bus at 3 p.m. on Sept. 22, bound for another Sunrise center in Dallas. Many needed wheelchairs, oxygen or dialysis, and some were lost in the fog of Alzheimer's disease. Had their trip been uneventful, as it was until 6 a.m. that Friday, just 22 miles shy of their destination, there would be no second-guessing, no what-ifs, no probing the practices of a tiny bus company. Those concerns have consumed many people: Caretakers who agonize that they did not do enough. Lawyers seeking recompense or retribution. Family members who envisioned gentle departures for their relatives. But in the aftermath of tragedy, peace may come easier for the very old. The 14 who survived, when 23 of their companions perished, are taking small pleasure in their remaining days rather than revisiting the moment with grief counselors. A Sense of Adventure Edna Briant's task on the bus trip was to look after her sister, Claire, who was oblivious to most of what was going on because of her advanced dementia. ''She didn't understand about fire or putting on her shoes, or whether to leave her purse behind,'' Miss Briant said. The sisters were evacuating for the second time in two weeks, sent to Brighton Gardens from their shared New Orleans apartment at a Sunrise center that was swamped once by Hurricane Katrina, again by levee breaches during Hurricane Rita, and is now in ruins. Virtually everything the two women owned was lost in the storms. Now the rest is gone, including Miss Briant's last $75, her Medicaid card, her checkbook and the key to a safety deposit box in New Orleans, all incinerated on the bus. Mr. Reynolds, a barrel-chested man, was charmed, he said, by ''them little bitty girls'' who passed an apple back and forth during the bus ride, alternating bites. He was already lying on the roadside when Edna was carried off the bus, flung over a rescuer's shoulder, and placed beside him. ''Prop her up on my good leg,'' Mr. Reynolds requested. That way Edna could see her if her sister was all right. Miss Briant did not ask about the others on the bus, not at the scene or later, after the group was flown from Dallas back to Houston on a flight reserved for the survivors and a dozen babies who had been evacuated from a foster care center. Rather, she regaled nurses and a reporter who visited her room with an animated account of her great airplane adventure. Going through airport security, patted down and wanded, was a new experience. An 11-day-old foster child was ''cute as can be,'' and Claire got to hold the baby. The flight attendants passed out goody bags with balloons shaped like airplanes and gave the old people pilots' wings, just as they do for children. Back home at Brighton Gardens on Thursday, Miss Briant was looking forward to her exercise classes, and to gardening, especially watering the Christmas cactus. But that activity was canceled, much to Miss Briant's disappointment, because of a session with a grief counselor. ''A man came to talk to us, but nobody understood him,'' she said. A History With Hurricanes London England, 86, a pioneer of early radio and television in Texas had been at Brighton Gardens for only three weeks, recovering from a broken hip when he was carried onto the bus. He was not fortunate enough to be carried off. The man with the unforgettable name had spent his lifetime telling and retelling an unforgettable story about hurricanes: his wife's grandfather had died while riding out ''the big one'' that wiped out Galveston in 1900. It was family lore, and he told it whenever he had a chance -- how his grandfather-in-law was found dead in his house by his son. How everyone else had gotten out, but he had refused to leave. So when Hurricane Rita approached Houston, Judy White, Mr. England's daughter, was not taking any chances. She made sure her father had what she thought was a safe exit in place, and then she and her family fled. ''There was no question that we'd all evacuate,'' said Ms. White, 56, who was staying at her father's house because her own home in New Orleans had just been destroyed by Katrina. ''We have a long history with hurricanes.'' She and her husband, their daughter and dog ''sat in traffic for 14 hours and never left the city limits,'' she said. Sweltering in 100 degree heat, starting to run out of gas, and thus reluctant to use the air conditioning, she turned around and went back to her father's home. She recalls feeling confident in her decision, thinking how much better her father would be on the cool, comfortable bus. It took days to confirm Mr. England was dead and begin planning his military funeral. ''We knew who got on the bus and who didn't get off the bus,'' Ms. White said. ''I'm just hoping he was asleep.'' Harry Wilson, 78, had never planned to sit in the front of the bus. He had wanted to be near his best friend, Natalie Lenzner, who had shared with him the indignities of age and illness. Both quietly knew she was most likely making her final journey. Mrs. Lenzner was already situated several rows back, and getting Mr. Wilson on board would be difficult since he was 6 feet tall and 189 pounds, and paralyzed on the left side from a stroke. So his daughter, Eileen Kisluk, a lawyer in Houston, suggested that firefighters carry him on last. Neither Ms. Kisluk nor her mother, Bernice Wilson, thought they could take care of Mr. Wilson in a Category 5 hurricane, which Rita was predicted to be. They needed to prepare their own homes for the storm and asked Jeffrey, Mr. Wilson's oldest child and an architect in Tampa, to fly to Dallas to meet his father with ''a friendly face'' when he got off the bus. Mrs. Lenzner's husband, Richard, 71, was also afraid to bring his wife home, knowing the power might go off and she would suffer needlessly, said the Lenzners' daughter, Michelle Tell. So Mrs. Lenzner went on the bus and her husband followed behind in his car, with Mr. Wilson's wheelchair in the trunk. The evacuation gave Mr. Wilson his first chance to travel since his stroke, and Mrs. Lenzner was looking forward to seeing her daughter and possibly being in Dallas for the birth of her second grandchild, two weeks away. Because he was in the front row, Mr. Wilson was the first person carried to safety. He lay on the side of the road, stung by fire ants, and watched helplessly, shouting warnings to rescuers that oxygen tanks were on board. In what seemed like 30 seconds, he said, the bus exploded. As Mr. Wilson was taken away in an ambulance, he worried about Mrs. Lenzner, whom he had not seen. Richard Lenzner had followed the Brighton Gardens' group for six hours, sharing the driving with his son, but pulled off the road to stretch his legs and walk his dog, Ms. Tell said. When he got back on Interstate 45, he figured the bus was way ahead of him. When he arrived at the Sunrise center in Dallas at 3 a.m., Mr. Lenzner was surprised the evacuees were not already there. Jeffrey Wilson arrived at the Dallas hospital shortly after the bus passengers, alerted that his father was there. He already knew Mrs. Lenzner had not made it. But he did not tell his father, waiting until his sister, Ms. Kisluk, arrived. She was the one accustomed to being in charge, he said, since his parents had moved from New York City to Houston to be near her. ''She's protective of him,'' Jeffrey Wilson said. ''She had wanted my mom to ride with him, but my mom saw no value in that. And thank God she wasn't on that bus, too.'' The Lenzners, for their part, had been prepared for Mrs. Lenzner's death. She had transferred to hospice care a week before the explosion. But Ms. Tell believed her mother would live long enough to see her new granddaughter. ''She wanted so badly to have a chance to hold the baby,'' Ms. Tell said. ''And I just really feel we were robbed of that.'' Help Moving Forward Unlike the elderly survivors, who are by their own accounts settling in without distress, the six staff members who had volunteered to ride the bus with the residents cannot speak of what happened without weeping. Ayu Tayework, a registered nurse, keeps asking herself: ''What if I did this? What if I did that?'' Bonnie Estes, an administrator, finds consolation only in the hope that this ''makes us stronger and softer.'' Dr. Joseph Morgan, whose mother, Alta, a resident, is three weeks shy of her 100th birthday, has no doubt that staff members did all they could. Their attentiveness began even before the buses pulled away, when the head nurse at Brighton Gardens gave him her cellphone number so he could track the progress of the evacuation. ''As a physician and as a son, I can tell you that moving them inland was wise,'' he said. Dr. Morgan, an oral surgeon, woke early on Friday, Sept. 23, to brew a pot of coffee and track the storm on television. He had not been among the city's 2.5 million evacuees because doctors were asked to remain behind. First up on CNN were reports that a bus carrying elderly people had exploded. The next report said it was en route to Dallas from a nursing home in Bellaire. ''That's when it got to be kind of personal,'' Dr. Morgan said. He immediately called the nurse's cellphone. ''Indeed, it was our bus,'' she told him. Then he waited. An hour and a half later, Dr. Morgan got a call from the emergency room at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. His mother's hair had been singed, and she had inhaled some smoke, but otherwise she was fine. As Dr. Morgan spoke, his mother, now back in Bellaire, was at her regular seat at dinner, enjoying the entree, chicken cacciatore, that two others in the dining room were complaining about. The resumption of talk about food was a signal that life was returning to normal. A few residents were busy with a 500-piece jigsaw puzzle. Some snored on the sofa. Everyone seemed delighted to see Mimi and Zoe, the dog and cat that live at Brighton Gardens, and to hear the twitter of birds in cages in every corner of the room. STORM AND CRISIS: THE EVACUATION Correction: October 8, 2005, Saturday Articles on Monday and on Sept. 25 included an erroneous account from Texas officials about the legal status of an unregistered bus that exploded and killed 23 passengers being evacuated from the path of Hurricane Rita. The state now says the bus was not covered by a waiver signed by Gov. Rick Perry to let unregistered commercial vehicles take part in the evacuation. A corrective report appears today in the National Briefing column, on Page A16."
"CURSE OF THE NARROWS By Laura M. Mac Donald. Illustrated. 356 pp. Walker & Company. $26. It's the lesson of New Orleans today, and 88 years ago it was the lesson of Halifax, Nova Scotia: Give fate the right ingredients and, eventually, the worst thing that can possibly happen will. In New Orleans, the equation was so obvious that people had been warning about it for years: low-lying city plus questionable levees plus hurricane zone equals catastrophe. In Halifax in December 1917, the components were different but the result was the same: send a ship packed with explosives into a busy harbor and some accident will set off a blast that kills hundreds and destroys a large portion of the city. Laura M. Mac Donald, who grew up across Halifax Harbor in Dartmouth, gives a detailed, often wrenching account of this calamity in ''Curse of the Narrows,'' a book full of ordinary people overwhelmed by a disaster. ''To this day it remains the biggest conventional explosion to detonate in the midst of a civilian population,'' Mac Donald writes. How big? J. Robert Oppenheimer, she says, used data from the accident to try to calculate what effect an atomic bomb might have. In early December a ship named the Mont Blanc called at Halifax, carrying a cargo of high explosives scheduled for an Atlantic crossing. Halifax is blessed with a natural sanctuary: the outer harbor, opening off the Atlantic, funnels into a slender but navigable channel -- the Narrows -- and through the Narrows is Bedford Basin. In the basin, ships can hide from both storms and enemies; in December 1917, it seemed the perfect place for the Mont Blanc to go to meet its convoy for the ocean crossing. Instead, though, small imperfections accumulated as the Mont Blanc sailed into the Narrows and another ship, the Imo, sailed out. Mac Donald relates them with exquisite patience: the language barriers among crewmen; the wartime policy change that made the flying of a red flag by ships with hazardous cargo optional (the theory being that the flags could attract Germans); and, above all, a few bad seamanship decisions -- just enough to turn nightmare to reality. The disaster unfolded in slow motion. ''Come and watch the strike,'' the commander of another ship had time to call to his crew. ''There's going to be a beautiful strike here.'' And there was, the Imo smashing into the Mont Blanc in the Narrows. But the explosion was not instantaneous: first the munitions ship, on fire, drifted toward the Halifax shore. ''The Mont Blanc, with 2,925 tons of explosives in barrels and kegs, packed in hermetically sealed holds inside a superheated hull, was now the most powerful bomb the war and the world had ever produced,'' Mac Donald writes. It waited to explode long enough for residents to come to the harbor or their windows to witness the spectacle (voyeurism that, because of flying glass, would cost many survivors their eyesight). The destruction wrought by the explosion and resulting sound wave, tsunami and chemical rain killed more than 1,950 people and injured thousands, but fate wasn't through with Halifax yet: even while survivors were wandering dazed through the rubble, a snowstorm struck that complicated rescue efforts. Those efforts make up the second half of Mac Donald's book, with a special focus on the heroic gesture by volunteers from Massachusetts who somehow made it through the snow. Reading ''Curse of the Narrows'' is not unlike following coverage of Hurricane Katrina: the account of the initial disaster holds us riveted; the aftermath, full of so many tales of woe, becomes numbing after a while. But, by sheer accident of timing, there is a present-day resonance to all parts of this tale -- the human failures, the confusion and panic, the heartening generosity. And, of course, there is the inescapable conclusion that if the wrong stars aligned in 1917 and in 2005, they will again, someplace where a city is built on an earthquake fault or in a tornado alley or beside a nuclear power plant.

"A man wearing a belt of explosives walked into a restaurant bustling with breakfast customers here on Thursday and blew himself up, killing at least 29 people and wounding 30, many of them police officers, the authorities said. The attack, on the Qadouri Restaurant, occurred shortly after 9:30 a.m. The cafe is popular among police officers, who, along with soldiers, are frequent targets of insurgents here, and it was packed with its usual breakfast crowd. The force of the explosion tore limbs from bodies and flung them into Abu Nuwas Street, in the heart of Baghdad, along with pieces of bread and beans from breakfast plates. A human scalp hung from a piece of plaster on the ceiling. It was the worst strike in a day of violence in Iraq that left at least 35 people dead and more than 50 wounded. The group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, led by the Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, posted an Internet message taking responsibility for the bombing in Baghdad, SITE Institute, a group that tracks postings by Islamic militants, reported. The death toll in the attack was the highest in the capital in two months. In a troubling sign that the insurgency may be extending its reach outside Iraq, Mr. Zarqawi's group also claimed responsibility for the coordinated suicide bombings of three hotels in Amman, Jordan, on Wednesday that left 59 people dead, including the 3 bombers. [Page A12.] After the claim, enraged Amman residents demonstrated in the streets, condemning terrorism in general and Mr. Zarqawi in particular. As if to answer the protests, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia issued a second statement Thursday night to explain to Muslims ''some of the reasons the mujahedeen targeted these dens,'' a translation by the SITE Institute said. The group's statement said the hotels had been attacked because they were favored locations for Western and Israeli intelligence agencies and were used as ''backdoor safe houses'' for the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government. In Baghdad, the restaurant was bombed after a six-day military sweep against insurgents in Husayba, a western city. That operation was intended to stop attacks like the Thursday morning bombing in Baghdad, which seemed to underscore how easily insurgents can move through the country to mingle in the daily lives of civilians, unleashing attacks that deepen the ethnic and political divisions in Iraqi society. In an Internet posting on Monday, Al Qaeda promised fresh violence if the forces did not withdraw from the west in 24 hours. The American Command has said that continuing military operations in the west have helped to significantly reduce suicide bombings in the capital. According to statistics provided by the military on Thursday, suicide attacks have declined since spring, although their frequency did not change from September to October. In its statement taking responsibility for the attack on the restaurant, Al Qaeda said Thursday that it was bombed only ''after watching the place and making sure that all his customers'' were from the largely Shiite security forces. The bombing at the Baghdad restaurant, though grimly familiar, stood out in the gruesomeness of its details. The plaster ceiling had fallen in and was soaked with blood, and the small tiled room smelled like a butcher shop. Chunks of flesh were among the debris. When the bomb went off, the restaurant was so crowded that some patrons were standing, said Majid Ali, an engineer who left just moments earlier. The bomber appeared to have detonated his explosives near the 29-year-old cashier -- whom co-workers knew only by his first name, Radhwan -- because the cashier's body was severed at its torso. ''I saw bodies flying everywhere,'' said Uday Muhammad Hassoon, who manages parking and other tasks for the restaurant. He said his ears were still ringing from the blast. ''We saw many accidents, but this one for me is very hard,'' he said. ''Five of my close friends were killed.'' The explosion occurred as the British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, arrived in Baghdad for meetings with Iraqi officials. Mr. Straw, who had come from Amman, the site of the hotel bombings on Wednesday, called on Syria to tighten security on its border with Iraq at a news conference broadcast on national television. American commanders say the hundreds of miles of open desert along the border allow foreign fighters and suicide bombers affiliated with Mr. Zarqawi to enter Iraq. ''He still has the capability of recruiting suicide bombers, training them and giving them munitions,'' Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch, a spokesman for the American command, said of Mr. Zarqawi at a briefing on Thursday. ''That's what happened in Baghdad today, and that's what happened in Amman yesterday.'' Also on Thursday, a car bomb exploded in Tikrit, north of Baghdad, killing four people outside an Iraqi Army recruitment center, an Interior Ministry official said. Three bombs exploded in two Baghdad neighborhoods, killing two American soldiers and wounding nine Iraqis, the official added. The American military had no report of the deaths, although statements on casualties often come several days after the fact. In the south near Kut, police officials found 27 bodies, handcuffed and blindfolded. The Qadouri Restaurant was threatened recently and was closed for several months, said Muhammad Abdel Qadr, a relative of the owner, a Sunni Arab in his 70's, whose nickname is Qadouri. Concrete flower planters recently were added to protect against car bombs, and large sacks of dried beans that looked like sandbags were in the upstairs window. But something seemed wrong on Thursday morning, Mr. Hassoon said. A solidly built man carrying a large bag walked into the restaurant but bought nothing. Mr. Hassoon searched his bag and found only a Koran inside. Mr. Hassoon said he suspected the man had been working with the bomber. Later, Mr. Hassoon saw a group of police officers who appeared to hesitate before coming inside. A lieutenant colonel and five other officers walked in the front door, and at that moment, the bomb exploded, Mr. Hassoon said. In a stroke of luck, he had just walked outside to make a phone call away from the din of the restaurant. The bomb left a breakfast frozen in time. A fork rested on a plate as if a diner was about to return. Iraqi bread, with a knife, was stacked in the kitchen. Lime wedges and salt shakers were scattered on a table, where blood was drying. Details did not seem to fit together. A man in a crisp yellow shirt and dress pants picked up pieces of flesh with a shovel. A hand clutching a cloth lay just beyond a small shoeshine stand on the sidewalk. Several workers and police officers discussed the identity of a human face, ears and scalp shorn of its skull that had been hanging on a piece of plaster from the ceiling. Some said it was the bomber, others said it was a diner. By late morning, the rescue workers had left, and the area grew quiet. Nothing but grief remained. A small boy, the son of a Christian man who sold soda near the restaurant, wandered on the sidewalk, crying: ''Oh, Daddy. Oh, Daddy.'' A man asked a police officer if his brother was among the dead. He walked off without a word when the officer answered yes. Outside, a man placed the face in a piece of brown cardboard and took it away."
"A cache of explosives stored at a former commander's house exploded Monday in a village in northern Afghanistan, destroying much of the village, killing 34 people and injuring 16, most of them women and children, local officials said. A medical team sent to the scene reported seeing 26 bodies prepared for burial before sunset, and 7 more bodies that had been pulled from the rubble, the director of the Civilian Hospital of Pul-i-Khumri, Dr. Muhammad Yusuf Fayez, said in a telephone interview. Another man with serious head injuries died in the hospital in the evening, he said, bringing the total dead to 34. Eleven people remain in the hospital, one of them in critical condition, Dr. Fayez said. The others were treated and released. The explosion was in the village of Kohna Deh, in Baghlan Province, about 75 miles northwest of Kabul, and was heard 15 miles away, the official Bakhtar news agency reported. The explosives were stored in the house of Jalal Bajga, a former commander whose regiment, once tied to the Defense Ministry, had recently been disarmed and demobilized under the national disarmament program. An Interior Ministry spokesman suggested that he had concealed a private cache of weapons from United Nations inspectors. Mr. Bajga's former deputy said Mr. Bajga had stored explosives for road construction in a room with a small door beside his house, the news agency reported. ''Probably someone entered the room and caused the explosion,'' he said. The provincial police chief, Fazluddin Ayar, said the commander, whose whereabouts was unknown, had stored about 400 boxes of one kind of explosive and 440 pounds of TNT. Six houses were destroyed, and 60 other buildings, many constructed from mud and wattle, were damaged, including the village mosque. The commander's brother and members of his family were among the dead, the Bakhtar news agency reported. THE REACH OF WAR: DEADLY BLAST"
"Two crude yet powerful explosive devices went off outside an office building on Third Avenue in Manhattan early yesterday, injuring no one but damaging a planter, shattering windows and prompting a large force of police officers to halt traffic on several blocks. Because the British Consulate is in the building and yesterday was Election Day in Britain, the blasts, which occurred at 3:55 a.m., had brief but wide-ranging effects. In Chicago, the police shut down traffic and searched the British Consulate for explosives, and in Washington, the Secret Service stepped up security at embassies. In Britain, financial markets went into a sharp decline about an hour after the explosions, just as voters were going to the polls. Nevertheless, the authorities said they could not connect the explosions with the British Consulate, nor with any of the other foreign or domestic offices in the building, 845 Third Avenue at 51st Street. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the city had received ''no threats, no phone calls'' before the event. ''It's quiet in the city,'' he said. The police said they knew of no motive, and the consulate said it had received no threats. One police official said the early hour of the blasts suggested that they were not meant to cause injuries. ''It is an indicator of perhaps sending a message without inflicting casualties -- that's what the early hour of the day would indicate,'' the official said. He added, ''The means doesn't indicate terrorism.'' One device was placed in a concrete planter a few yards outside the glass entrance of the building, and the other exploded on the sidewalk. The blast in the planter was powerful enough to throw a foot-long chunk of concrete into a glass pane. Another piece of one of the grenades, with the fuse still attached, was embedded in a wall across the street at 850 Third Avenue, nine stories up. The explosive devices were ''novelty'' grenades that had been stuffed with black gunpowder and equipped with fuses, said Raymond W. Kelly, the police commissioner. He described them as ''crude but powerful.'' ''If it were in a crowded area, it could have caused significant injuries,'' Commissioner Kelly said. A bellman at the San Carlos Hotel on East 50th Street described hearing the explosions. ''It was very loud, but it sounded exactly like thunder,'' said the bellman, Santos Figueroa Jr., 27. ''I looked outside and it didn't look like it was going to rain.'' In the bright spring morning, amid crowds of onlookers and television cameras, police officers in white suits gingerly picked up pieces of the shattered devices, placing them in plastic bags. After examining fragments, the police said one grenade was modeled after the rough ''pineapple'' type commonly used during World War II, and the other was modeled after the smooth ''lemon'' type that was used in the Vietnam War. The police believe both were lighted shortly before they detonated. Neither had a timing device. The police are reviewing 17 video surveillance tapes from 15 locations, including one from a bank across the street that shows the two explosions. The bank video, which is of poor quality and needs to be enhanced, also shows a red flash arcing upward, hitting the building and bouncing off, the police said. It could have been a piece of a grenade, or a grenade thrown upward that then exploded on the ground, the police said. The blasts drew police officers from the 17th Precinct station house and firefighters from the adjoining firehouse a half-block away on 51st Street. ''No one saw anyone running away,'' Mayor Bloomberg said. The police briefly questioned a possibly inebriated Dutch employee of the United Nations who arrived on the scene soon after the explosions and broke through a barrier. He was given a summons and eventually released. The videotapes showed several potential witnesses near the building, including a number of pedestrians, a jogger, a bicyclist heading north on Third Avenue after the explosion, and a taxicab passing in front at the time of the explosion. Commissioner Kelly urged the witnesses to contact the police. A consulate official said the police had emphasized that it was not clear that the consulate was the target. Other occupants of the building have attracted controversy in the past, the police said. One recent protest, for example, concerned Israeli policy on Palestinians, and was directed at an official of the Caterpillar Corporation there, since the Israeli Army uses special Caterpillar bulldozers. The police allowed traffic to resume along Third Avenue by 11 a.m."
"A giant stainless steel tank of scalding-hot water at a commercial laundry plant in the South Bronx exploded yesterday, blowing out a cinder-block wall and sending two people to a local hospital with second- and third-degree burns. The force of the blast from the 150-gallon tank, which occurred about 11:30 a.m., jolted two high-pressure boilers and showered a sidewalk on East 139th street with bricks and twisted pipes. Gabe Blau, the plant manager at Modern Tech Cleaners, identified the two victims as the chief mechanic, Geoffrey Pitter, and his assistant, Luis Acevedo. Both men were burned by steam. At least three other employees were near the tank when it burst. ''I just heard the explosion, and I started running,'' said Maria Angelica Giron, an employee, speaking in Spanish. She said that all the employees ran to an exit on the opposite side of the building. The three-year-old tank, about the size of a small car, was connected to three high-pressure boilers. Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the Buildings Department, said that only two of the boilers had permits. She said yesterday that the department was placing ''cease-use'' notices on all three boilers and expected to issue a violation to the owner of the company for the one that was installed without a permit. A spokesperson for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, John Chavez, said yesterday that an investigation was under way. Mr. Pitter and Mr. Acevedo, the workers, suffered second- and third-degree burns to their legs that were not life-threatening, said James Long, a Fire Department spokesman. They were taken to Jacobi Medical Center. A third person who was not identified was treated at the scene for minor injuries, but refused further treatment. ''They were just walking by,'' Mr. Blau said of the injured men's proximity to the explosion. Shortly after the blast, about 30 workers who wash roughly 30,000 pounds of linens and uniforms for several Manhattan hotels every day gathered outside the one-story building, which is on Walnut and Locust Avenues in Port Morris, a quiet industrial section of the southeast Bronx. Some had tears running down their faces, and all appeared stunned. As firefighters inspected the rubble, the owner of the company, James Choung, 57, stood nearby, saying he was dazed. ''Someone called and told me what happened,'' Mr. Choung said. ''I built this business for seven years. Now I don't know what's going to happen. We have to make deliveries.'' Employees said that the Ritz-Carlton was one of the hotels expecting deliveries. Mr. Choung, who employs about 60 to 80 people on two eight-hour shifts, said he was scrambling to get help from other laundry companies. Rebecca Rand, a spokeswoman for the Ritz Carlton-Central Park, said yesterday that the hotel kept back-up supplies that would allow them to make due in the meantime. At the laundry, Mrs. Giron, a union delegate, said that it was not a safe place to work, and that many of the employees, particularly those who are illegal Mexican immigrants, were paid $6 an hour, less than her $6.40 an hour. She blamed the accident on neglect by the owner. She said there had been small fires at Modern Tech before, but never an accident on this scale. But Mr. Choung, the owner, said that the company held safety meetings and that he ran a very safe business. ''It's a safe place,'' Mr. Choung said. ''Everything's updated. Right now I can't think what was the cause of this.''"
"Gunmen ambushed the senior Bahraini and Pakistani diplomats in separate attacks as they drove through the capital on Tuesday, spurring Pakistan to announce the withdrawal of its ambassador from Iraq. Even as insurgents tried to undermine the new government by striking at Muslim envoys, Iraqi politicians made some progress on writing a new constitution, in an effort to give Iraq political legitimacy. In a meeting, Shiite and Kurdish politicians accepted 15 Sunni Arabs who had been chosen to increase Sunni representation on a constitutional committee. In the attacks on Tuesday, the Bahraini diplomat, Hassan Malallah al-Ansari, was struck in the right hand by a bullet and taken to a hospital, while the Pakistani ambassador, Muhammad Yunis Khan, escaped unharmed, though a car in his convoy was raked by bullets. The ambushes came three days after the top Egyptian diplomat here was kidnapped as he drove alone through western Baghdad. Insurgents appear to have begun an organized campaign to drive Muslim diplomats out of Iraq as the American and Iraqi governments are pressing Arab countries to send ambassadors here and upgrade their diplomatic ties. The militant group led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian fighter, said in an Internet posting late Tuesday that it had kidnapped the Egyptian diplomat, Ihab al-Sharif. The message said Mr. Sharif was abducted ''by the hands of our mujahedeen, and he is under the control of the mujahedeen.'' The group made no immediate demands. At least 10 Iraqis and one American soldier died in other guerrilla attacks on Tuesday. The meeting of the constitutional committee ended a brief impasse that had developed because a few committee members had tried to disqualify some of the Sunnis because they might have been senior Baath Party officials. In theory, Sunni Arabs will now have more say in the constitution, though it is unclear how representative these politicians are of other Sunnis and whether they will be able to work smoothly with the committee. The White House had been urging the 55-member committee, which before Tuesday had only two Sunni Arabs on it, to be more inclusive, in hopes of politically co-opting the Sunni-led insurgency. The relocation of Pakistan's ambassador to Amman, Jordan, from Baghdad after the attack comes as a blow to the Bush administration's efforts to win more international backing for the American and Iraqi enterprise here. Pakistan has been President Bush's most crucial ally in the war in Afghanistan, and the presence of its ambassador here lent an important show of support to Iraq from a crucial Muslim nation. ''We are watching the deteriorating security situation in Iraq very closely, and Ambassador Khan has been relocated to Jordan,'' a Pakistani Foreign Ministry official, Muhammad Naeem Khan, said in a telephone interview in Islamabad. ''It's a temporary measure, solely to ensure the safety of our ambassador. It will be reviewed as soon the situation improves.'' He added that the Pakistani Embassy would remain open in Baghdad. Mr. Khan was assigned to his post three months ago. Though Pakistan has full diplomatic ties with Iraq, predominantly Sunni Arab nations have yet to upgrade their missions here to that status. In late June, Egypt and Jordan said they planned to strengthen ties, after Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice publicly urged such a move by Iraq's neighbors. Mr. Sharif, the abducted Egyptian diplomat, was expected to be the first full ambassador to Iraq from a Sunni Arab country. According to the Iraqi Foreign Ministry Web site, there are 46 foreign missions in Iraq, of which 14 are predominantly Arab or Muslim. The attacks on the diplomats began at 8:45 a.m. as Mr. Ansari, the top envoy from Bahrain, was driving to work through the Mansour neighborhood, an Interior Ministry official said. Gunmen opened fire on the car, then rushed from the scene. Mr. Ansari was taken to Yarmouk Hospital, and television images showed him sprawled on a gurney with blood flowing down his right arm. A convoy carrying Mr. Khan, the Pakistani ambassador, was ambushed at 2:30 p.m. in the same neighborhood, Iraqi and Pakistani officials said. Gunmen driving past in two sedans sprayed the convoy. Mr. Khan's bodyguards fired back, and the gunmen fled. Pakistani contract workers and truck drivers have been attacked throughout the war. The Foreign Ministry official in Islamabad, Muhammad Naeem Khan, said a Pakistani Embassy worker who had been kidnapped several months ago was freed only after ''hectic efforts.'' Now, the insurgents ''realize Iraq is consolidating its position with other nations,'' Laith Kubba, a spokesman for the Iraqi government, said at a news conference on Tuesday. ''They are trying to intimidate other diplomatic missions in Iraq.'' In what appeared to be an unrelated incident, a senior security official under the Saddam Hussein government, Assad Abdel Hadi Haidar, was found dead in an apartment in Cairo on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Haidar was bound to a chair and his mouth and nose were taped. The Egyptians have arrested five men, including Mr. Haidar's real estate agent. In the Iraqi capital, gunmen opened fire on a van carrying employees to Baghdad International Airport, killing four women and injuring at least three other workers, the Interior Ministry said. Two Iraqi soldiers died and seven were wounded in a bombing and firefight in Abu Ghraib, while a mortar attack in Samarra aimed at an American convoy killed a 13-year-old girl and wounded four others, The A.P. reported. In another mortar attack, two sisters were killed north of Ramadi. A suicide car bomb exploded in a town west of Kirkuk, killing one Iraqi soldier and wounding another. The American military said one soldier was killed and two wounded by a roadside bomb explosion in southern Diyala Province. In the morning, the head of the constitutional committee, Humam Hamoudi, announced that the committee had accepted the 15 people suggested by Sunni Arab groups to help draft the constitution. Mr. Hamoudi, a prominent Shiite official, said the committee had decided that it did not immediately matter whether the Sunnis had questionable political backgrounds. It was more important to ensure that the Sunnis have a voice in writing the constitution, he added. ''If we were talking about ministries, names might be more important,'' Mr. Hamoudi said at a news conference in the fortified convention center. ''But since it's a committee, having the views is more important than the names.'' The committee agreed with Sunni leaders last month that the constitution would only be drafted by consensus. But Mr. Hamoudi said Tuesday that consensus did not mean unanimous approval. As long as the ''general attitude'' of the committee indicated approval, the constitution would go forward, Mr. Hamoudi said. He added that the committee would have a draft completed by the end of July. The constitutional committee held an hourlong meeting with 12 of the 15 new Sunni members in the afternoon. The mood was positive and there was little talk of Baathist connections, said three Sunnis who attended. ''They invited all the Sunni members; they didn't reject any names,'' said Saleh M. al-Mutlak, a member of the National Dialogue Council, a Sunni political group. The Sunni members were handed copies of the sections of the constitution that had already been written by the committee. Although subcommittees have completed large portions of some chapters, the Sunnis said there had been no effort to rush ahead with parts dealing with contested issues like federalism or the role of Islam in Iraqi law. None of the Sunnis contacted said that they had had time to absorb the material by late Tuesday. ''They gave us what they have written, but there was not enough time to read it,'' Mahmoud al-Mashhadani said. ''I'm on Page 1.'' THE REACH OF WAR: THE INSURGENCY"
"A fruit and vegetable market near a busy Brooklyn intersection became a scene of terror and pandemonium yesterday when a transformer exploded outside the store, sending flames and hot gases roaring up from the sidewalk. Five people were injured, including a woman walking into the store, the Ralph Avenue Fresh Farm market in Bedford-Stuyvesant, who was so badly burned that witnesses said they saw skin peeling off her arm. ''I was approaching the store when I heard a loud boom, and then I saw all the fire and saw people running and screaming and yelling,'' said Jackie Fields, 30. ''I thought it was a terrorist attack.'' The transformer, which belongs to Consolidated Edison, exploded about 12:45 p.m. outside the entrance to the store, which is near Ralph Avenue and Broadway. The blast knocked off the transformer's half-inch-thick steel cover, and a flame shot up, burning a hole in the market's green awning. ''It looked like a geyser exploded,'' said Uitaek Lee, 51, the market's owner, who was inside the store a few feet from the point of the explosion. ''Three or four people who were there fell down.'' The woman whose arm was badly burned was taken to NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital, fire officials said. Another woman suffered less serious burns, the officials said. She and three other people who were injured but not burned were taken to local hospitals. None of the victims' names were released. Firefighters arrived minutes after the blast, and the fire was under control by 1:18 p.m., said Tommy Gerardi, a spokesman for the Fire Department. Transformers sometimes explode when they are overloaded. But in this case the transformer did not appear to have overloaded and it was not clear what caused it to blow up, said Michael S. Clendenin, a spokesman for Con Edison. It contained 330 gallons of a type of coolant that is flammable, he said. ''We're going to examine the equipment inside the transformer to find out what led to the fire,'' Mr. Clendenin said. ''We should know within a week.'' He further explained that transformers can catch fire for various reasons, including short circuits, overloading, overheating or deteriorated insulation. Fires can release gases, like carbon monoxide, which can lead to a buildup of pressure and cause an explosion. An underground explosion last September near the Port Authority Bus Terminal blew manhole covers 10 feet into the air and injured five people. Moments after yesterday's explosion, Abrahim Abdalla, 30, a security guard from a store next door, rushed over with a fire extinguisher and helped put the fire out, several witnesses said. ''I saw something, and I thought it was a bomb,'' Mr. Abdalla said. ''So I searched for something to help put out the fire.'' Inside, Mr. Lee was getting water and paper towels for the victims, said his wife, Kae-Ae Lee, 45. One of the victims, a nun, was lying on the ground, crying, ''Help me,'' Mrs. Lee said. The flames left rows of melons, peaches, grapes and bell peppers blackened, some of them with melted plastic wrappers over them. The nun, Sister Maria Rosa Lopateguy of the Carmelite Sisters of Mercy on Putnam Avenue in Brooklyn, said she left the scene of the explosion without realizing that her hand had been injured. It was only afterward, when she was shopping for fish, that the owner of the fish store told her that the back of her habit was badly singed, she said. ''Once I got out of the flames I didn't realize what had happened,'' she said as she sat in the waiting room with another nun at Woodhull Hospital. ''I feel very lucky that I am alive.''"
"In Park Slope, Brooklyn, it was quiet. But not far away in Crown Heights, the pop-pop-pop of illegal firecrackers echoed into the night. So it was in New York City on the Fourth of July 2005, a decade after City Hall began its crusade against illegal fireworks. Scattered evidence from various neighborhoods suggested that the fight had been won on some blocks, and is far from over on others. While the old center of the city's campaign, Ozone Park in Queens, is now mostly quiet, gentrified neighborhoods in Manhattan and Brooklyn seem content to get their fill of pyrotechnics from the folks at Macy's. The authorities said millions of people craned their necks skyward to watch last night's Macy's show, where 36,000 shells were exploded over the East River. Many other neighborhoods took on the feel of a shooting gallery, too. From explosions in Washington Heights to bursts of light from powerful explosives in Crown Heights and parts of Queens, many New Yorkers celebrated the holiday with a bang -- an illegal one. ''It's like a turkey at Thanksgiving,'' said Joey, 16. He was hanging out on the streets of Maspeth, Queens, with a group of friends, waiting for the cover of night to begin the festivities with a boom. Joey and his friends chipped in to buy about $1,000 worth of fireworks. Before the sun went down, they set off some of the smaller firecrackers, holding the big guns in reserve. Tucked away, they had the following illegal arsenal: ''firecracker mats,'' which are strings of 1,000 firecrackers whose crackling explosions last 10 minutes at a time; M-80's, which were developed by the military to simulate gunfire; Blockbusters, which have the explosive power of half a stick of dynamite; and Pineapples, which combine two Blockbusters for a jaw-rattling explosion. They also had what are called mortars, essentially metal tubes used to launch larger fireworks, the kind that explode into a rainbow of colors in the sky. ''It's cool to blow stuff up,'' said Jonathan, 16. Like others who were setting off illegal fireworks and were interviewed, he would not give his last name. Interviews and observations in six neighborhoods found that many people were brazenly flouting the fireworks laws. While Harlem and Park Slope were relatively quiet, fireworks could be seen and heard in neighborhoods in Queens and Manhattan, especially after dark. In Washington Heights, on a corner of 171st Street near Broadway, a group of young men, women and children kept an eye out for the police as they set off a large display. As smoke filled the air, a police car rolled, lights flashing. Minutes later, more officers arrived to clear the block, but even as they worked, other explosions sounded in the distance. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said before the holiday weekend that they would continue to enforce a zero-tolerance policy for any illegal fireworks. ''Fireworks are illegal because they are dangerous, a lesson that is learned tragically each year,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''That is why we are making arrests and seizing fireworks as the Fourth of July approaches.'' As of last night, the Police Department had no immediate reports of injuries from any displays. Residents interviewed across the city, for the most part, agreed that the Fourth of July was much quieter than it was before the city stepped up enforcement, but many said they noticed more explosions this year then in recent years. The crackdown began in 1995, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani created a task force to combat unlawful fireworks and ordered the arrest of anyone caught with anything illegal, even sparklers. In 1996, the police seized 20,000 cases of fireworks worth an estimated $43 million. The epicenter of the fight that year was in Ozone Park, where about 250 police officers set out to stop an annual block party given by John J. Gotti Jr., the head of the Gambino crime family. This year, 1,115 cases of fireworks have been seized, a number that the police pointed to as a sign of success. They said that in the past 10 years the number of injuries from fireworks dropped by 86 percent, to 8 last year from 56 in 1995. They said the number of fires caused by fireworks on the Fourth of July had also fallen, to 203 last year from 1,063 in 1994. But while Ozone Park has also been quiet in recent years, Jamie Califano, 35, said he sensed that things might be drifting back to the way they once were, if only slightly. ''Last night I saw more fireworks than in the last seven years,'' he said, noting that he bought about $300 of illegal fireworks for his own family. Where the police used to line the trestle of the overhead train tracks to watch the behavior in the neighborhood, this year there were no officers, Mr. Califano said. Elsewhere in Queens, teenage boys dashed from intersection to intersection setting off fireworks both large and small. Sal, 16, Jimmy, 15, and P.J., 15, called themselves the ''horseshoe crew'' and bragged that they had been setting off explosions for three days. Sal put three Roman candles into a thin metal tube and stuck it in some grass near the sidewalk, using a butane lighter to ignite the fireworks. Another teenager took out an M-80, lighted it in the street and dashed for cover. A girl named Alyssa, 4, yelled, ''Everyone hold your ears.'' The little bomb exploded, setting off another explosion of noise: car alarms triggered by the vibrations. The use of illegal fireworks was not universal, however. For instance, residents in Park Slope recalled the way their neighborhood used to be turned into a firing gallery on this holiday. This year, it was mostly quiet. Rogelio Holder, 43, a construction worker who has lived in Park Slope for 35 years, recalled how the neighborhood used to pour out onto the streets to eat and have fun. ''You didn't have to watch Macy's fireworks; we had our own,'' he said. ''We waited for the sun to go down to see this free show. It's Independence Day. Pow, pow, pow all day long.''"
"A car bomb hit a small army convoy on Wednesday in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian-administered Kashmir, killing at least three soldiers and a civilian. A militant organization, Hizbul Mujahedeen, claimed responsibility for the bomb, which exploded in front of a Christian missionary school in a neighborhood that is home to senior politicians and government officials. Eighteen people, including four soldiers, were wounded; no students were among those hurt. It was the third explosion in front of a school in past few months, and came amid rising violence in the region. ''It is a clear-cut terrorist attack in which small children could have died or been injured'' said Gopal Sharma, police chief of Jammu and Kashmir. Muslim militant organizations based in Pakistan-administered Kashmir have waged an armed struggle for 15 years for an independent Kashmir. India accuses Pakistan of providing training and arms to the groups. Indian security forces killed four heavily armed militants of Hizbul Mujahedeen on Tuesday in a fierce encounter in Poonch, in southwestern Kashmir. On Monday six men from one family were killed by people suspected of being Pakistan-based militants in Udhampur, in the south. The Indian Army said that since April 22, militants had made 24 attempts to infiltrate from Pakistan-administered Kashmir to the Indian side, and that 84 had been killed. Lt. Gen. S.S. Dhillon, India's new army chief in Kashmir, referring to Pakistan's Army, said: ''I am quite certain that they are not unaware of this infiltration. But what active support they are giving to the infiltration, it is difficult for me to tell you.'' India and Pakistan, observing a 20-month-old cease-fire, are engaged in a fragile peace dialogue. Some experts fear the recent worsening of violence is aimed at derailing that process. ''Pakistan wants to keep us and Americans off balance and confuse,'' said S.K. Singh, India's former ambassador to Pakistan. ''On the one side, they want to give the impression that they are genuine in peace dialogue; on the other hand, they are supporting the jihadi groups.'' Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India, speaking Wednesday in Washington, warned that the peace effort would falter unless Pakistan curbed the attacks."
"Lebanon's departing pro-Syria defense minister escaped an assassination attempt with minor injuries on Tuesday in a car bombing that killed at least two people and wounded a dozen in a Christian suburb north of Beirut. The bombing was the latest in a series that have set nerves on edge in the country. The minister -- Elias Murr, who is also deputy prime minister in the departing government and the son-in-law of President _mile Lahoud, a major ally of Syria -- was hit by shards of metal in his face and hand as a booby-trapped car exploded beside his motorcade at midmorning as it passed through the Christian area of Antelias on its way to the capital. Previous bombings have singled out critics of Syria, which played a dominant role in Lebanon for 29 years and virtually ruled it for the last 15. The most notable bombing was a vast explosion in February that killed Rafik Hariri, the former prime minister, in his heavily armored Mercedes along with 19 other people. That assassination led to huge popular demonstrations and international pressure that forced Syria to withdraw its troops from its smaller neighbor in April. A prominent Druse opposition figure, Marwan Hamadi, escaped a bombing in October that killed his driver, and last month two outspoken opponents of Syria's dominance here -- a prominent journalist, Samir Kassir, and the Communist leader George Hawi -- were killed by nearly identical precisely placed car bombs under their seats. In addition, there was a series of bombings in Christian neighborhoods that diplomats believe were intended to show that Lebanon could not be stable on its own. The Tuesday bombing came as the prime minister-designate, Fouad Siniora, presented a proposed cabinet list of 30 ministers to President Lahoud. Mr. Siniora was chosen by the opposition grouping headed by Mr. Hariri's son, Saad, and the Druse chieftain Walid Jumblatt, which won a parliamentary majority in elections last month. There was no claim of responsibility for the bombing, which could be heard in downtown Beirut, 10 miles to the south. The police estimated that the bomb had contained as much as 200 pounds of TNT. Its force hurled cars into nearby villas, gouged a large crater and left a 500-yard trail of burned or damaged cars and blood spattering the pavement. Witnesses described medics removing a charred body from a mangled car and Mr. Murr, bloodied, staggering out of his car and being driven by passers-by to the nearby Serhal Hospital. President Lahoud issued a statement saying those who had attempted to assassinate Mr. Murr ''are enemies of Lebanon who do not distinguish between Lebanese whatever their allegiance and position.''"
"Capt. James Dayhoff heard one of the most frightening sounds for a combat soldier in Iraq: simultaneous ''smoke whistles'' from two rocket-propelled grenades shot at him from behind. The projectiles hit a wall about 25 yards in front of him, and he knew his men were vulnerable. ''At that point I knew my Humvees were overmatched,'' he said, and he moved his men out of the range of insurgent gunners to wait for tanks to arrive. Captain Dayhoff, commander of Battery L of the Third Armored Cavalry, was fighting on Tuesday to reclaim Tal Afar from insurgents who have made it a major smuggling and operations base. The regiment took over here last month, and its 1,000-man Sabre Squadron undertook its largest operation yet on Tuesday to root out insurgent leaders here in northwestern Iraq, in a city of a quarter million people. American commanders say the operation, in which one American soldier died, rounded up a large number of insurgent organizers. According to accounts by several company commanders, as many as 10 insurgents were killed in the fighting. But the fighting also showed how entrenched the insurgents have become here. The mission began at 5:30 a.m. when soldiers from Capt. Greg Mitchell's unit, Company H, drove their tanks and armored Humvees out of the desert and onto the streets of the Sariya neighborhood, the insurgents' most trusted haven in Tal Afar. The target was suspected insurgent leaders and financiers in two houses. ''At the one I got to the fastest, everyone was there,'' said Captain Mitchell. ''Eight suspects were supposed to be in one house and all eight were there.'' They did not fight. ''They are facilitators -- middle-aged men with money and connections who do the planning and take advantage of young kids,'' he said. ''These men don't pull the trigger themselves. That's why they give up so easily.'' The first two hours of the operation went smoothly. Troops seized 28 suspected insurgents who were blindfolded and handcuffed and loaded into trucks and armored personnel carriers. The detainees, who seemed surprised by the size, timing and direction of the attack from the desert, were caught off guard. ''Usually if they are going to fight, it will be in the first 10 minutes, so we'd know it by now,'' one soldier said. But other insurgents fought back hard. Near a firehouse where the Sabre Squadron commander controlled the operation from a back of a Bradley armored vehicle, a 120-millimeter mortar shell exploded with such force that soldiers less than 100 yards away initially mistook it for an improvised bomb. No one was hurt in the explosion, which covered a Bradley parked 10 feet away with chunks of asphalt and sent a plume of thick black smoke high in the air. Commanders said they believed the mortar had been fired from near the city's hospital, where insurgents and American forces fought last month. Before they had time to forget the mortar, soldiers at the firehouse heard sniper bullets whiz by. ''We got sniper fire! That's a sniper,'' shouted Command Sgt. Maj. Mark Horsley, ordering troops to take cover. Insurgents also struck several helicopters flying in support of the ground troops, said Lt. Col. Chris Hickey, the Sabre Squadron commander. ''We had a couple of Kiowas and a couple of Apaches hit,'' he said. All aircraft made it back to the base. The pilot of one Kiowa handed controls to his co-pilot and used his M-4 rifle to shoot and wound an insurgent firing on the aircraft, Colonel Hickey said. One goal was to surprise the insurgents so that ''all of a sudden there was a squadron in their backyard,'' he said. ''Overwhelming force deters a lot of violence.'' He said most of the counterattack that began mid-morning had come from insurgents from other areas of the city. The fight also intensified north of the firehouse. Iraqi soldiers attached to Troop F, another of Sabre's maneuvering units, moved up an alleyway when they reached a bend. Two Iraqi soldiers and an American stepped into the bend when an machine-gunner on the roof shot and wounded the American. The Iraqi soldiers retreated to the street. But Sgt. First Class Gary Villalobos corralled some Iraqi troops and tried to save the American soldier, whose name, rank and unit are being withheld pending notification of his next of kin. While the sniper continued to fire into the alleyway at the wounded American, Sergeant Villalobos used body language to get the Iraqi troops to join him in returning fire, said Capt. Jesse Sellars, the commander of Troop F. Eventually the sergeant was able to loft a well-aimed hand grenade at the roof, killing the gunman. Troops got the wounded American to a waiting vehicle, but he died."
"City officials said yesterday that a spark from a grinding machine possibly caused the explosion that killed a 45-year-old contractor on Friday as he worked in the storage lot of a Staten Island company that makes environmentally friendly fuel. The police said that the man, John Drury, of Little Silver, N.J., was apparently repairing a pinhole leak on an 8,000-gallon drum when it exploded. He was found dead at the scene, the police added. A woman who answered the telephone yesterday at Mr. Drury's house declined to comment. City officials said they had not yet determined what was in the tank that exploded. But Thakoordeo Harnanan, who works as a production manager at the company, Environmental Alternatives, said that the tank Mr. Drury was trying to fix contained 1,400 gallons of glycerin. Mr. Harnanan said glycerin is a waste product of biodiesel fuel, which the company makes from soybean oil. The business is located at 14 Van Street, in Mariners Harbor. At the accident scene yesterday, representatives from various city agencies participated in the cleanup and investigation. A spokesman for one of the agencies, the Department of Environmental Protection, said the agency would probably levy several fines against the company, because the owners had been storing about 1,000 gallons of methanol, several hundred gallons more than they were licensed to keep. Mr. Harnanan said that the owner of Environmental Alternatives had purchased two storage tanks from a company owned by Mr. Drury's uncle, and that Mr. Drury had been sent to locate, and then fix, the leak. ''He was a gentleman with a soft tone,'' Mr. Harnanan said of Mr. Drury. ''He liked to take his time doing things.'' Mr. Harnanan said that his company didn't own a grinder, and that he assumed the one found in the wreckage had been used by Mr. Drury to smooth the storage tanks in preparation for applying a sealant. ''He alone knows what happened,'' he said."
"Three people were killed, five were injured and at least three others were unaccounted for Tuesday after a thunderous explosion and fire ripped through a three-story apartment building here shortly after 9 a.m. The explosion occurred as firefighters and utility workers were investigating a report that workers excavating an oil tank had damaged a natural-gas line running under a driveway next to the building. The blast blew out part of the rear brick wall of the building, sent glass flying from its windows and rocked the foundations of nearby buildings. Residents fled into 20-degree air, some nearly naked. Minutes later, people in nearby houses and apartment buildings, including one that also caught fire, fled carrying clothes, valuables and colorfully wrapped Christmas presents. At least two dozen residents from the burned buildings were forced to find other places to stay. Firefighters arrived about 20 minutes before the explosion to investigate the reported gas line rupture, said Bergenfield Chief John Pampaloni, who was among those who went to the scene. The chief said they had not evacuated the apartment building, at 30 Elm Street, because they did not detect either of the telltale signs of a natural gas leak: the odor of gas or the hissing sound of gas escaping from a line. Mary Brown, 42, said she was taking a shower in her second-floor apartment when a ''powerful explosion rocked me backward.'' She threw on her pajamas, coat and boots, she said, and ran out of her apartment. ''There was no door,'' she said. ''It was blown off the hinges.'' She found an elderly neighbor in the hallway, crying, her clothes singed, trying to enter a burning apartment. ''She said that her husband was in there,'' said Ms. Brown, a school janitor. ''Debris fell on him, and the apartment was full of flames. We couldn't get in there. He's gone.'' Dennis McNerney, the Bergen County executive, said the dead had not been identified and that firefighters would return to the scene Wednesday to search through the building for any additional victims. Three or four residents had not been located last night. At Hackensack University Medical Center, Dr. Joseph Feldman, the head of the emergency room trauma department, said three victims had been brought to the hospital. One woman was in critical condition with second-degree burns on 40 to 50 percent of her body, and her prognosis was described as ''guarded.'' She was identified as Elsa Vargas, 67, a resident of the building's second floor, by her son-in-law, Eric Robinson. Another woman had injuries to her head and body and was listed in stable condition. A third victim, a man with a head injury and a second-degree burn to the hand, was treated and released. Two other victims with less serious injuries were taken to Englewood Hospital and Medical Center. Chief Pampaloni said firefighters had been called to the building by a work crew reporting that a gas line had been damaged after the ground caved in while they were digging out an old oil tank. He would not identify the crew's employer. The chief said he and workers from Public Service Electric and Gas were cutting off the gas to the building from a valve at the curb when the blast occurred. ''I turned to look toward the back of the building, and I had glass blowing over my head,'' he said. He said dirt may have collapsed on the pipeline, covering the smell and muffling the sound of escaping gas. Questioned at a news conference last night about his decision, Chief Pampaloni defended his actions, saying that residents in the building had not complained about an odor. ''I don't know why I didn't smell anything,'' he said. ''At that point, it was not an obvious gas leak.'' Chief Pampaloni said he could not explain why a broken gas pipe outside could appear to cause an explosion inside the apartment house. He said the fire's point of origin was also under investigation. The excavation of the oil tank began on Monday after Public Service painted lines on the asphalt tracing the location of the utility lines so the work crew could avoid rupturing a line, said George Cardenas, the utility's division manager for northern New Jersey. He said utility workers informed the excavating crew how deep the lines ran underground after testing for their location. Chief Pampaloni said the walls of the excavation were two to three feet from where utility workers had marked the location of the gas lines. The National Transportation Safety Board, which has jurisdiction over pipeline accidents as well as air, marine and rail accidents, is sending a team to observe at the scene, said Paul Schramm, a spokesman for the agency. He said excavations were a leading cause of pipeline accidents. The fire was brought under control about 2:30 p.m. after firefighters from at least seven municipalities battled it with fire hoses from the ground and a water cannon mounted on a ladder that rose like a crane high above the building's roof. The southwest corner of the apartment building had collapsed to reveal a cross section of the interior and the blackened remains of furniture and walls. Flames continued to flare up into the evening in that section of the building, causing problems for firefighters looking for additional victims, the chief said. The mayor of Bergenfield, Richard Bohan, described most of the apartment building's residents as middle and working class, mirroring most of the 28,000 residents in the town, an ethnically diverse, blue-collar community about seven miles northwest of the George Washington Bridge. The building, just off one of the town's main commercial strips, is nestled among single-family homes and small garden apartment complexes with names like Magnolia Court and a strip of light industrial buildings that back up to a railroad right of way. ''Everyone in here was working class,'' said Antonio Puig, 42, who had lived at Elm Court for the last three years. He had left for work just minutes before the explosion and returned when he heard news of it. Phil Dursik, 52, a resident of the building for the last 10 years, said he was at a doctor's appointment, but his wife, Kay, was home. ''My wife was in her bed, and she said that when it blew up, it threw her out of bed,'' he said. Mr. Robinson said his in-laws, Nicholas and Elsa Vargas, were in their apartment in the building at the time of the explosion. A neighbor was able to get to Mrs. Vargas, who escaped from the building, he said. But he did not know the whereabouts of his father-in-law, who he said was 78 and in poor health. ''The last news we had, he was still in the building,'' he said."
"The authorities yesterday identified the third victim killed in a natural-gas explosion at an apartment building in Bergenfield, N.J., on Tuesday. The victim, Somsak Vichitlakakran, 52, was identified through dental records by the Bergen County medical examiner's office, said Capt. Rick McGarril of the Bergenfield Police Department. He lived on the third floor and his apartment was ''right in the blast area,'' Captain McGarril said. Mr. Vichitlakakran worked as a quality control manager for a wallpaper factory and was the father of two teenage daughters, his ex-wife, Sue Frankel, told The Record of Bergen County. He worked an overnight shift on Monday, arriving home around 6 a.m. Tuesday and was most likely asleep when the blast occurred, she said. Also killed were Nicolas Vargas, 78, and Frank Smith, 76. Mr. Vargas's wife, Elsa, remained in critical condition in the burn unit of St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J., Captain McGarril said. The explosion occurred around 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday after a pit dug by an excavation crew that was removing an oil storage tank collapsed."
"One day after an apartment building in Bergenfield, N.J., was destroyed by a natural-gas explosion that killed three people, fire officials faced sharp questioning yesterday about their decision not to evacuate the building or test the air for leaking gas after being alerted that a nearby pipeline had been damaged by a work crew. Fire Chief John Pampaloni, 52, who was among the Bergenfield firefighters responding to the scene on Tuesday, told reporters at an afternoon news conference yesterday that neither he nor his men smelled gas near the site of the damaged pipeline, which ran under a driveway next to the three-story, 24-unit building. A crew was excavating an old oil tank when dirt collapsed into the hole, ''pinching'' the steel pipeline, according to the fire officials. The chief, looking weary yesterday, said that he detected no odor of gas when he went into the front of the building, so he saw no need to use a hand-held monitor to check for the presence of gas. About 20 minutes after the firefighters arrived and were working with utility workers to shut off the gas, an explosion shook the Bergen County neighborhood and blew off the back of the brick building. Chief Pampaloni, who is also the public works supervisor in Bergenfield, said that the town's department of 68 volunteers and 6 full-time firefighters regularly responded to reports of leaking gas, and that his crew's trip to the building on Tuesday seemed like a ''routine situation'' because the firefighters did not smell gas and no residents had complained of any odor. As an eight-member team from the National Transportation Safety Board started its investigation into the explosion yesterday, law enforcement officials identified two of the three fatalities as Nicolas Vargas, 78, of Apartment 8B, and Frank Smith, 76, of Apartment 6C. Two others remained hospitalized: Mr. Vargas's wife, Elsa, 67, was in critical condition at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston with burns over nearly half her body. Kathleen Moat, 39, was in fair condition with serious cuts at Hackensack University Medical Center. Several other residents of the building who had not been accounted for late Tuesday turned up safe yesterday, according to officials. John Erickson, a vice president for the American Public Gas Association, said it was possible that a leak occurred elsewhere along the pipeline as it connected to the building. Records from Public Service Electric and Gas indicated that the gas line was a steel pipe carrying gas under a pressure of 12 pounds per square inch, said Karl Gunther, who is heading the National Transportation Safety Board's investigation. Mr. Erickson said steel lines can often crimp or bend, but not break, when damaged in an excavation, creating ''tension'' further along the pipe that could cause a leak at a weakened joint. If such breaks are under asphalt or frozen ground, he said, ''fugitive gas'' can migrate along the line until it finds a place to rise. ''It can follow the pipe right up to the building wall and if there are cracks in the foundation it will rise and could get into utility ducts or risers,'' said Mr. Erickson, who added that such situations are unusual. Six residents of the building who were interviewed at a Red Cross office in Hackensack yesterday and who were at home at the time of Tuesday's explosion said that they had not detected a gas odor. But Mr. Gunther of the N.T.S.B. said town fire officials told his investigators that several building residents had called the department to report the smell of gas that morning. Ms. Moat, in an interview at the hospital in Hackensack, said that she smelled a strong odor of gas in her third-floor apartment in the heavily damaged back of the building. She said she checked the pilot light on her stove, and when she saw it was still burning, she returned to her bedroom to watch television. Ms. Moat said that as she lay in her bed: ''I heard this noise. It felt like someone taking a sledgehammer to my head. I felt my teeth slam.'' She said she saw a wall of her apartment fall away, and she landed, still in her bed, near the front room of a downstairs neighbor's apartment. She remembered Mr. Vargas, one of the dead, rolling water-cooler refill bottles down the hall and carrying them up the stairs. He would always decline her offers of assistance. ''He wouldn't take my help,'' she said. ''He was a gentleman.'' Yet he would offer her help carrying her laundry up the stairs, she said. But she would never accept it, she said, because he was elderly. Mark Pawlak, 32, and his wife, Wani, 29, were not home at the time of the explosion. The couple spent the night at a hotel in Hackensack, concerned about the unknown fate of their four cats in Bergenfield. ''I can't understand why it happened, or how it happened,'' Mr. Pawlak said. ''We just want to know what happened and why.'' Mrs. Pawlak added: ''It's still so surreal, it doesn't even feel like it really happened. I wish I could wake up.''"
"The mayor of Bergenfield defended the town's fire chief Wednesday amid questions concerning his actions on Dec. 13 between the time a gas line was damaged and a building exploded about a half-hour later, killing three people. Richard J. Bohan, the mayor, stood before the city's municipal building with members of the Town Council and defended Chief John Pampaloni after many residents and news organizations had asked whether he should have evacuated the building before the explosion. ''We are backing our fire chief, Pampaloni,'' Mr. Bohan said. ''The Fire Department has so many great men and women in the department, and we felt that the chief had to be recognized that he did his job and he did his job well.'' Chief Pampaloni, 52, a volunteer member of the department who is also the town's public works supervisor, was one of the first to arrive on the scene that day. An excavation crew working to remove an oil tank outside the building, 30 Elm Street, reported damaging a gas line to the building and officials reported being notified of the smell of gas. Chief Pampaloni had an air monitor that can detect gas but did not use it because, he said, he did not smell gas or hear a hissing noise. A worker for the utility company, Public Service Electric & Gas, arrived and got a high reading of gas on his monitor, but the explosion occurred moments later as workers were closing the valve. Mr. Bohan said the 6 full-time members of the Fire Department and 68 volunteers receive extensive training, but he would not provide details when pressed about Chief Pampaloni's training on gas leaks or why he did not use the air monitor. ''The chief did his job the way he knows best,'' Mr. Bohan said. After several more questions about the chief's actions, Mr. Bohan angrily ended the news conference. ''The man is trained,'' he said with a scowl. ''We support the man.'' Wani Pawlak, 29, a resident of the building, listened to the mayor's remarks and quickly responded with her own criticism. ''I think the Fire Department could have taken care of the incident in a different way,'' Ms. Pawlak said. ''I just don't like it when anyone defends the fire chief because, in my mind, anyone who has common sense wouldn't.'' Ms. Pawlak said she had retained a lawyer and was thinking about filing suit against the town and the excavation company, American Tank, of Montclair, N.J. Several other residents have already filed lawsuits. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the blast and has removed several sections of the damaged gas line for testing. A final report is expected within 10 months. On Wednesday afternoon, Tom Phelan, who lived on the third floor, returned to the building to retrieve his charred computer and hundreds of canceled checks and other financial documents that lay just inside a chain-link fence that surrounds the battered building. ''Everything I accomplished in my life is gone,'' Mr. Phelan, 77, said while climbing on a large pile of bricks and broken glass mixed with burned book pages, clothing and furniture. ''I have this emptiness inside of me.''"
"Investigators examining the explosion and fire at an apartment building in Bergenfield, N.J., that killed three people and left at least 75 others homeless or displaced started to examine a nearby excavation site yesterday where a gas line was damaged when the walls of the hole collapsed. A team made up of town fire investigators and experts from the National Transportation Safety Board and the state's Board of Public Utilities combed through the excavation where a crew from American Tank Company was digging up an old oil storage tank on Tuesday morning. Other investigators were looking closely at whether the excavator and the utility properly identified the location of utility lines before the digging began in a driveway next to the building. ''We have people on the ground right now beginning to pressure-test the line to see where the break occurred,'' said James Giuliano, director of the reliability and security division of the Board of Public Utilities. ''We are looking at the whole situation to see if the law was breached or not.'' The Bergenfield mayor, Richard Bohan, said that 75 to 100 people either lost their apartments or have been unable to return to nearby homes, but that the Bergen County community of 28,000 was rallying to help. The town has raised $6,000 in private donations in a special fund for the victims, and at City Hall, donated clothes have been piling up. ''We're running out of space, but how do you say no to people who are going out and purchasing new clothing for these people,'' Mr. Bohan said. ''It's unbelievable, the love coming in through that door.'' The police have identified two of the dead as Nicolas Vargas, 78, and Frank Smith, 76, both residents of the three-story, 24-unit building. Capt. Rick McGarril of the Bergenfield Police Department said that while the police believe they know the third victim, they were waiting for a confirmation by a pathologist who planned to use dental records to make the identification of the man. The police also provided a detailed time line of events on Tuesday morning that provided a clearer picture of the response by emergency and utility crews. Firefighters arrived at the scene at 8:54 a.m. after a nearby resident called 911 to report a possible gas leak, according to the time line. It was the only report of a gas leak, according to the police, who disputed a statement by a federal investigator on Wednesday that others had also reported a possible leak. The dispatcher also alerted Public Service Electric and Gas. The volunteer fire department chief, John Pampaloni, was among those who responded to the scene. He said he did not smell gas or hear the hissing sound often associated with a leak, so he did not use a hand-held gas detector to test conditions or evacuate the nearby apartment building at 30 Elm Street. At 9:21 a.m., a two-person crew from Public Service Electric and Gas arrived. Jennifer Connell, a spokeswoman for the utility, said that as one of the workers approached the excavation, ''his gas measurement device registered a high reading of gas.'' At 9:26, he turned to tell his partner to shut off the gas from the valve to the right of the building at the curb, ''and in a matter of seconds there was an explosion.'' A fire ensued that gutted much of the building. Carl Heitmeyer, a fire instructor for five years with the New Jersey State Safety Council, has instructed fire departments on dealing with gas emergencies. He said that there is no ''Gas Emergency 101'' for volunteer firefighters, and the course that he conducts emphasizes relying on the sense of smell first and avoiding any action that might ignite escaping gas. An evacuation should be ordered, he said, if an odor is detectable or others report the odor of gas. In outdoor settings, he said, escaping gas could rise or disperse so quickly that it would not register unless a detection meter was held right over the leak. Mr. Heitmeyer also said that gas leaks in lines running under frozen ground or asphalt can be extremely hard to detect by smell or with a measuring device. While investigators were examining the excavation site yesterday, residents of the apartment building made homeless by the explosion were struggling to find their bearings. Residents provided firefighters with lists of some of their valued possessions because they remained barred from the site. At least six have received shelter assistance from the Red Cross, and others have turned to relatives and friends. Anthony Puig, 42, a tenant of the building for three years who left for work on Tuesday only a few minutes before the explosion, said he planned to look at some rental apartments. He said he was trying to remain as upbeat as possible. ''I walked out of something others got hurt in, and passed away,'' he said. ''Losing things is not a big deal compared to life.''"
"The bombs were identical in size and design: one in a black nylon duffel bag, the other in a black knapsack with grayish trim. Each was made of 10 kilos of powerful commercial explosives -- essentially sawdust soaked in nitroglycerine -- with nuts and bolts for shrapnel. Left on seats in a commuter rail car, they were detonated almost simultaneously using cellphones. The explosions ripped into the steel, plastic and fiberglass, sending a deadly shock wave through the passenger compartment and hurtling twisted chunks of metal, debris and tiny bits of the bombs hundreds of feet in every direction. Almost everyone in the rail car should have been killed. But the bombmaker, like those who worked with him that day, was remarkable because he assembled the explosives to help catch terrorists. An expert bomb investigator, he was helping to train his peers from across the country. The blast, which took place early this year at the China Lake Naval Air Weapons Center in the California desert north of Los Angeles, was observed by dozens of state, local and federal investigators, including the commander of New York Police Department Bomb Squad. It was part of a highly specialized F.B.I. training seminar, a five-day program which is presented several times each year across the country and includes the detonation of a thousand-pound truck bomb. The program helps investigators better understand the awesome power of such devices and, according to the chief trainer, Special Agent Kevin Miles, it teaches them how to piece together a device after an enormous blast and reveal a bombmaker's unique signature. It gives them the confidence to know that they can do their job, he said, to help find the bomber. The class, the Large Vehicle Bomb Post-Blast School, is one of more than half a dozen ways big-city police departments and federal investigators keep up to date with the latest in terrorist technology in a deadly and fast-moving discipline. Others include routine training, like that conducted by bomb squad investigators in New York City, who build bombs that their colleagues must defuse. There is also an F.B.I.-run database that, with help from the Pentagon and the C.I.A., tracks emerging bomb technologies and trends from Iraq and Israel to Europe and South America. And the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is close to completing a sophisticated computer program that can use data like the size of a bomb crater and the distance that debris was propelled by a blast to help solve terrorist bombings. ''The only thing limiting a bombmaker is the bomber's imagination, so the more tricks and tools he has at his disposal, the more things he can come up with,'' said Lt. Mark Torre, the New York Bomb Squad commander who attended the vehicle bomb school early this year. Lieutenant Torre, who has spent more than half of his nearly 20 years in the department investigating bombers, noted in an interview that as their technology increased, so did the sophistication of the men and women charged with stopping and catching them. ''It's not a race; it's more like a marathon,'' said the lieutenant, an intense man who, while animated, seems nonetheless to possess an unnerving sense of calm and a placid stare. The New York Police Department Bomb Squad, the nation's oldest, largest and very likely the busiest, celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2003, tracing its roots back to a turn-of-the-century unit that investigated extortion bombings against Italian immigrants. The detectives, police officers and supervisors assigned to it work and train almost nonstop, Lieutenant Torre said. But they are intensely cautious about discussing the work, citing the extreme danger that they -- and, to a lesser degree, the public -- face every day, and they are reluctant to reveal what they do and how they do it for fear of aiding their adversaries. In fact, largely for those reasons, the close-knit community of bomb squad investigators and technicians across the country is something of a secret society. So there is much Lieutenant Torre will not discuss, including how many men and women are assigned to the unit. But he acknowledges that the number has grown substantially since 9/11, along with the workload. Before the Sept. 11 attack, the number of reports of suspicious packages investigated by the New York Police Department numbered in the hundreds, although the bomb squad was not needed in every instance, officials said. This year, it has already handled more than 7,000, with 1,848 in just the three-week period after the July 7 bombings in London. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said in an interview that gathering intelligence on terrorist bombings around the world and how that information can apply in New York was an essential element of the bomb squad's work. ''One of the concerns,'' he said, ''is the improvement in bombmaking tradecraft that we see in Iraq.'' To that end, Mr. Kelly has underwritten extensive training and travel for bomb squad investigators to places like Israel, Britain and elsewhere to learn first-hand about how terrorists in those nations are building bombs and carrying out attacks. An important training exercise, Lieutenant Torre said, is the squad's practice of building and defusing -- rendering safe, in the parlance of bomb technicians -- dummy devices, from suitcase and backpack bombs to almost everything imaginable, with firing mechanisms ranging from simple to highly complex. One investigator takes on the role of bomb builder, constructing a device without explosives, while another seeks to figure out how the bomb works, using X-ray equipment and other technologies, and render it safe. ''It's important because it keeps you sharp, it tests your skills in the various disciplines that we utilize,'' he said, ''whether it be an investigative skill as in X-ray interpretation or a render-safe bomb disabling tool.'' The dummy devices have a functional firing system, usually setting off an electronic firing mechanism if the bomb technician fails. Lieutenant Torre would not offer his teams' success rate, saying only, ''We win many more than we lose.'' The bomb squad also has access to the range of federal databases and the International Association of Bomb Technicians and Investigators, an organization and intelligence-sharing network that brings together nearly 5,000 bomb investigators from around the United States and the world. But training is no substitute for investigating a large blast, and there are only a handful of technicians around the world who have actually worked a real crime scene after a huge explosion like the ones Agent Miles sets off in his training sessions, several longtime investigators said. ''There are no experts -- no one has done it often enough to be an expert,'' said Michael White, a former commander of the New York bomb squad who now does similar work for Mike Stapleton Associates, a company that provides explosives-detection services for large corporations and government agencies. ''The threat always changes, and there is always something new.'' So, with the threat of an attack on American soil looming, particularly in New York, Agent Miles holds more than a dozen of training sessions each year, with the aid of the military, mostly on military bases. The skills and experience gained by the New York investigators and others who attend are invaluable, several of them said, because they learn that no matter how large the blast, at the end of the day, they can still piece together the bomb. ''These crime scenes that we do are gigantic -- these are not bombs intrucks, these are not bombs in cars, they are truck bombs and car bombs,'' Agent Miles said. ''What the students learn is, there is evidence out there, there is evidence in that mess of the scene if they're patient enough.''"
"Eric Robert Rudolph, the man responsible for the pipe bomb explosion at the 1996 Summer Olympics here and three other bombings, offered his first public apology on Monday at what could well be his last public appearance, a sentencing hearing attended by about two dozen victims and family members. ''I cannot begin to truly understand the pain that I have inflicted upon these innocent people,'' Mr. Rudolph said, reading a statement, adding, ''I would do anything to take back that night.'' Still, Mr. Rudolph, who will be imprisoned for life, spoke only of the bombing at Centennial Olympic Park, which marred one of Atlanta's brightest moments, killing one person and injuring more than 100. He did not mention two bombings at women's health clinics in Atlanta, where six people were injured; a bombing at a clinic in Birmingham in which an off-duty police officer was killed and a nurse was injured; or a bombing a gay club in Atlanta that left five people injured. But the Eric Rudolph in court on Monday was a far cry from the Eric Rudolph who, captured after hiding in the North Carolina wilderness for five years, declared himself ''bloodied but emphatically unbowed'' after pleading guilty in April to the four bombings, and who smiled and appeared to wink at victims at his sentencing hearing in Birmingham last month. ''I saw a scared Eric Rudolph,'' said James R. Stadler, who had been picking up his 8-month-old twin daughters at the office building in Sandy Springs, Ga., on the day Mr. Rudolph set off two bombs outside. ''Especially when they led him away, that final time.'' Mr. Rudolph maintained that his cause -- to anger and embarrass a government that permits women to have abortions -- was just. But prosecutors took exception to his contention that the Olympics bombing was a protest of legalized abortion. David E. Nahmias, the United States attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, said that investigators had spoken to almost everyone who had ever known Mr. Rudolph and he had not mentioned abortion. ''He was full of openly expressed hatred for the federal government, law enforcement, African-Americans, Jews, Hollywood, there's a whole list of things,'' Mr. Nahmias said. ''The one thing that there was virtually no evidence of is that he had expressed an opinion on abortion.'' One or two victims said they heard sincerity in Mr. Rudolph's apology, but more said it was less than satisfying. ''What I was really looking for was something more sincere, something real for this moment,'' said Fallon Stubbs, 23, who was with her mother, Alice Hawthorne, the night the Olympic Park bomb killed her. Sixteen victims or family members of victims spoke at the hearing. John D. Hawthorne, Alice Hawthorne's husband, said that Monday would have been their 18th anniversary, and a video tribute recounted how Ms. Hawthorne rallied people in Albany, Ga., to come out for the Olympics torch run, even though it was at 1 a.m. Mr. Hawthorne said Mr. Rudolph had a Napoleon complex. ''Little person, big bomb,'' he said. ''But you are still a small man.'' Mr. Hawthorne said that after Monday, he would answer no more questions about Eric Rudolph. Ms. Stubbs, also wounded by shrapnel, offered Mr. Rudolph forgiveness. ''Because of you, I have become a tolerant person,'' she said. ''Not for you, but for me, I forgive you. I look at you. I love you. ''And if I cry,'' she added, ''it's not for me. It's not for my mother. It's not for my father. It's for you.'' Afterward, she told reporters that she had made eye contact with Mr. Rudolph only once, for a brief moment, before she looked away. Many of the victims catalogued the lasting effects of the bombings, pointing out shrapnel wounds and severed fingers, speaking of constant pain and sleeping pills, hearing loss, seizures and nightmares. ''Look at my face, my hand, my limp, the damage that is visible,'' said Ron Smith, a victim in the Olympics bombing. ''Now, consider the emotional damage. May my face, my injuries and my statement be what you see and hear every night.'' Most took solace in the fact that Mr. Rudolph, sentenced on Monday to four consecutive life terms plus 120 years, would be locked away for the rest of his life. But Mary Agnes Lee, who had been the groundskeeper in Centennial Olympic Park before the bombing, said she wished Mr. Rudolph could be executed. ''I hate you, I don't want you to live,'' she said. ''But God's going to help me overcome those thoughts.'' Prosecutors had agreed not to seek the death penalty if Mr. Rudolph pleaded guilty and revealed the whereabouts of about 250 pounds of dynamite he had cached in the North Carolina woods. In Birmingham last month, he was sentenced to two life sentences without parole. Mr. Rudolph, in his statement to the judge, repeated some parts of an 11-page statement he released after pleading guilty. He spoke in detail about two 911 calls he made after planting the bomb in Olympic Park to try to warn the authorities. Again, prosecutors scoffed. In the first call, Mr. Nahmias said, Mr. Rudolph told the dispatcher, ''This is a statement from the Free Militia, we defy your new world order and you ----'' before the call cuts off. Twelve minutes later, he said, Mr. Rudolph called again to warn of the bombing, but did not give the location because he was afraid he had been spotted. Memrie Creswell, 37, a victim in the bombing of the Otherside Lounge, a gay club, suggested that Mr. Rudolph did not get enough affection from his mother as a child. Afterward, she told reporters that he made eye contact with her until she mentioned his mother. ''He looked down at that point,'' she said. ''He rolled his eyes when I said that I'm going to trump his evilness with love for the rest of my days.''"
"Two Canadian peacekeepers suffered minor injuries on Monday morning when a roadside bomb exploded less than a mile from the Sinai military base where international troops are stationed to monitor the peace accord between Egypt and Israel. As the peacekeepers drove by, a gas canister planted on the side of the road was detonated by an electric wire, the governor of North Sinai, Ahmed Abdel Hamid, told Egyptian state television. A second wired gas canister that failed to blow up was found at the site, Mr. Hamid said. The two men were part of the Multinational Force and Observers, a peacekeeping mission created as part of the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. It is financed by Egypt, Israel and the United States, and has historically been a very low-risk assignment. The force is not under the United Nations flag. Egyptian security officials provided little information about the blast and issued a statement that said there had been a ''limited explosion'' on a desert road outside the force's base in El Gorah, Sinai. The statement did not mention any injuries and denied earlier news reports stating there were casualties."
"A pickup truck carrying rockets exploded on Friday at a large Hamas rally as the group paraded its weapons through a densely packed refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. At least 15 people were killed and dozens were wounded, Palestinian medical officials said. The powerful blast sent a plume of white smoke into the sky and unleashed pandemonium in the sprawling Jabaliya refugee camp, a Hamas stronghold just north of Gaza City. Body parts were scattered on the ground as ambulances rushed to the scene, and people in the crowd wailed in grief. The casualties included a number of children. The blast appeared to be accidental, and the Palestinian Interior Ministry issued a statement that called on Hamas to ''shoulder its responsibility'' for the explosion. However, Hamas said the rockets were dummies and did not contain explosives. The group alleged that an Israeli airstrike was responsible and said that it would retaliate. ''We cannot remain silent when the blood of our martyrs is spilled,'' said Nizar Rayan, a Hamas leader. ''Our response will be in action, not words.'' The Israeli military, which routinely acknowledges strikes carried out by its aircraft, said it was not involved. ''Any attempt to use this incident as a pretext for attacks against Israeli civilians will be viewed with gravity,'' a military statement said. Palestinian militants fired a rocket into Israel from the Gaza Strip overnight, wounding five Israelis, the Israeli Army said Saturday. Israel in turn launched airstrikes in the Gaza Strip on Saturday, hitting buildings it said were used to manufacture weapons in and around Gaza City. One Hamas militant was wounded. Also, Israel announced it was imposing a closure on the Palestinian areas of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which means that Palestinians cannot enter Israel. But only a small number of Palestinians have such permission to begin with. Homemade Palestinian weapons have exploded unintentionally many times in the past, causing numerous Palestinian casualties. Hamas and other Palestinian factions in Gaza have staged a series of celebratory rallies, with their weapons prominently displayed, following the recent withdrawal of Israeli soldiers and settlers from the territory. The Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, met the factions on Wednesday and called on them to stop brandishing their weapons in public. Hamas and the others promised to stop doing so after Saturday. The casualties in the blast on Friday included Hamas members and supporters in the crowd. In addition to the 15 killed, more than 80 were wounded, The Associated Press reported, citing Palestinian hospital officials. The past few weeks have been mostly calm, but the explosion in Gaza and an Israeli military raid in the West Bank raised tensions on Friday. Israeli soldiers killed three armed members of Islamic Jihad when an arrest turned into a gun battle near the West Bank town of Tulkarm, the Israeli military and Palestinians said. Mr. Abbas called the Israeli raid ''a very dangerous step,'' adding: ''We are trying to keep the calm, but unfortunately the Israelis resort to this totally unjustified behavior.'' The Israeli raid, and others staged in recent months against Islamic Jihad in the Tulkarm area, followed two suicide bombings carried out by Islamic Jihad, one in February and the other in July, that killed 10 Israelis. In both instances, the bomber came from a village just outside Tulkarm. Islamic Jihad did not join other Palestinian factions that agreed in February to a temporary truce. Shortly after midnight Thursday, the security forces surrounded a house near Tulkarm where a group of armed Islamic Jihad members were hiding, the Israeli military said. A gun battle erupted and two Islamic Jihad members were killed. A third escaped but was later shot and killed in a nearby village, the military and Palestinians said. Hours after the Israeli raid, Palestinians fired several rockets from northern Gaza toward the nearby Israeli town of Sederot, but they fell harmlessly. Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility and said the rockets were in response to the shootings in the West Bank. Rocket attacks from northern Gaza were common before Israel withdrew from the territory on Sept. 12, but had largely halted since then. In southern Gaza, the Palestinians reopened the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, but said it would remain open for just 48 hours to allow the passage of people with special needs, like Palestinians seeking medical treatment in Egypt, and students with permission to study in Egypt. The move was the first time the Palestinians have formally opened the border under their control. The Gaza-Egypt border was the scene of widespread chaos after the final Israeli troops left Gaza. Thousands of Palestinians and Egyptians crossed back and forth, though Egyptian and Palestinian officials had assured Israel that the border would remain closed after the Israelis left. Palestinian and Egyptian security forces restored order this week, and had kept the border sealed for the past several days. Israel is establishing a separate crossing nearby, and intends to control the flow of people between Gaza and Egypt for at least six months."
"A suicide bomber on a motorbike drove into a convoy of Afghan soldiers boarding minibuses outside their training base on the edge of Kabul on Wednesday afternoon and detonated his explosives, killing 9 people in addition to himself and wounding 28, the Defense Ministry said. The bomb, which killed eight members of the military and a civilian bus driver, was the first major violent incident since parliamentary elections 10 days ago, and the first suicide attack in Kabul in months. Intelligence officials warned in recent days that suspected Al Qaeda suicide bombers had entered the capital and the southern part of the country and intended to detonate explosions. The attack here occurred at 4:30 p.m., during the afternoon rush hour as a crowd gathered to board buses. The Kabul military training base lies on one of the busiest roads leading into the capital from the eastern town of Jalalabad. The Defense Ministry spokesman, Gen. Zaher Azimi, said a guard had seen a motorbike drive into the crowd, but that exactly what happened was still under investigation. Three minibuses exploded into flames, the police said. In a phone call to one of the local language services of BBC Radio, a Taliban spokesman, Abdul Latif Hakimi, said his organization claimed responsibility for the attack. The bomber, named Mullah Sardar, was a member of the Taliban, Mr. Hakimi said. Two other attacks were reported in eastern Afghanistan. A United Nations car was hit in a roadside explosion, critically wounding an engineer from Bangladesh and two policemen, and a mine explosion killed one civilian. In both cases, the explosives were believed to have been placed by Taliban insurgents, local officials told news agencies. The attacks on Wednesday came as the official in charge of security forces, Interior Minister Ahmed Ali Jalali, resigned after nearly three years in his post. The deputy minister for security, Zarar Ahmed Muqbal, will take over the job temporarily. Election officials have warned that they expect an increase in violence as results of the elections for Parliament and provincial assemblies begin to be announced and 5,000 of the candidates learn that they have failed to win seats. Mr. Jalali's departure may be the first of several cabinet changes as the newly elected Parliament is expected to challenge the current makeup of the cabinet when it convenes in December. U.S. Interrogator Pleads Guilty FORT BLISS, Tex., Sept. 28 (AP) -- An American military intelligence interrogator pleaded guilty Wednesday to maltreatment and assault for assaulting a detainee in Afghanistan who later died. Sgt. Joshua Claus was the sixth soldier to be convicted or plead guilty of abusing detainees, in the wake of the deaths of two prisoners at the Bagram airfield detention center. In all, charges were filed against 14. Sergeant Claus also pleaded guilty to forcing another inmate to kiss a soldier's boots."
"A woman walked up to the gate of a new army and police recruitment center in Tal Afar, a northern city, on Wednesday and blew herself up, killing 8 people in addition to herself and wounding 57, hospital and security officials said. The bomber, who The Associated Press reported was dressed in men's clothing, struck at 10:45 a.m. outside the gate of a building that houses the new recruitment center and an American military office that processes compensation forms for Iraqis, the officials said. She detonated her belt of explosives, spraying metal balls into a crowd that had gathered, awaiting a security check, they said. Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the terrorist group led by the Jordanian militant, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, claimed responsibility for the attack in a posting on a Web site. The posting said the attack had been aimed at the recruitment center, which opened just five days earlier. The attack occurred as the military finished several weeks of sweeps in Tal Afar, whose successes had been frequently trumpeted by Iraqi officials. The suicide bombing was the deadliest of several strikes on Wednesday, which left at least 19 people dead throughout Iraq. In Washington, President Bush predicted more violence in Iraq before the national vote on Oct. 15 on a constitution, but he said the terrorists would not succeed. ''They can't stand elections,'' Mr. Bush said in the White House Rose Garden, where he was flanked by his top military command. ''The thought of people voting is an anathema to them.'' Tal Afar, which is close to the Syrian border, has long been a problem spot for the military, which says it is a gateway into the country for foreign fighters. Suicide bombers in Iraq are rarely women, though there has been at least one other. During the American invasion in 2003, a woman driving an explosive-packed vehicle blew herself up near an American checkpoint in Anbar Province in western Iraq. In Tal Afar, the bomber, in a familiar pattern, struck at the most vulnerable Iraqis. Saleh al-Qadu, the head doctor at Tal Afar's main hospital, said soldiers brought nine bodies in plastic bags to the hospital. One bag held the bomber's head, he said. The American military said that the blast had killed 5 people and wounded 30, and that the targets had been civilians outside its military claims office. Dr. Qadu said the building housed the recruitment center and the claims department. In other attacks, an explosion on Wednesday in Najaf in the south tore through the house of a guard for the rebellious cleric Moktada al-Sadr, killing one of the guard's brothers and another relative, and wounding eight others. A police official said the blast occurred in the house, but Sahib al-Amiri, an aide to Mr. Sadr, said a grenade had been thrown at the house from a passing car. Violence against American forces surged, with the military announcing that four soldiers had been killed in three days in attacks in Falluja, west of Baghdad, and Safwan, near the Kuwait border. In Baquba, north of Baghdad, a car bomb exploded at a military checkpoint at 3:45 p.m., killing a civilian and wounding 13, including 8 police officers, an Interior Ministry official said. Scattered violence left four people dead in Baghdad. At 8 a.m. a roadside bomb that apparently was meant for a police commando unit killed a civilian. Gunmen began shooting at American forces near the Ghazilia Bridge in western Baghdad, killing an Iraqi police officer. In Sadr City, the Shiite slum in eastern Baghdad, another police officer was killed."
"THERE is an explosion on your subway train. You survived the initial blast. What should you do? The distressing reality is that I, and no doubt the vast majority of my fellow passengers, have little idea what to do if terrorists decide to follow up the 9/11 attacks with an assault on the subway system. After the train attacks in Madrid and London, I started looking at the exits on subway trains, and what I found was deeply disturbing. The other day, for example, I rode on the end car of a No. 6 train. The rear door leading to the track was marked by a bright red circle with a white bar through the middle, bordered by these words: ''No Exit. Emergency Use Only.'' The door was locked (I tried it, discreetly). No sign indicated that the windows could be pushed out, though there are such signs on PATH and New Jersey Transit trains. There was a sticker that told me in case of a fire, I should notify the train crew and remain on the train. Nothing about what to do in case of a bomb. No offense to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, but if my train is welling with smoke in the wake of an explosion, my instinct will be to get out of there. While I am aware of the third rail that will fry me like a fish stick if I land in the wrong place, I'm considering desperate measures for desperate times. I certainly don't intend to wait for help from the train crew in light of the Transportation Workers Union's recent complaint that the New York Police and Fire Departments are conducting training drills in subway tunnels without including subway motormen or conductors. Assuming I manage to escape from the train, now I'm standing in a dark, smoke-filled subway tunnel. What next? I can try using my cellphone to light the way. I just can't use it to call for help. How will everyone else respond? Panic seems inevitable. The Police Department's random backpack checks notwithstanding, no one -- as far as a regular subway passenger like me knows -- has initiated a public awareness campaign telling the public what to do if a bomb goes off on a subway train. In schools and offices, we practice fire drills. Why aren't there subway drills? Between stops, we could listen to a police officer explain how to respond to a subway emergency. We could even spend an hour taking part in a random subway evacuation drill. All of us get inconvenienced by train delays. Now there will be at least one good reason for getting held up on the subway. We know now, more than ever before, that each of us has some level of personal responsibility for emergency preparedness. Having first responders teach us what to do in an emergency is a much better plan than packing into a subway system millions of ill-prepared, spottily searched riders whose initial response to an explosion may be the worst response. How about holding a citywide emergency drill? The Police and Fire Departments hold drills. So do agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency (though maybe it should have held more). We should demand to be included in some of them. We can even bring the motormen and conductors with us. No one needs to start diving under desks like 1950's schoolchildren or learn any genuinely classified information. But we should understand ahead of time what the first responders want us to do in the event of a catastrophe, and be prepared to act immediately in accordance with those plans. Preferably, the first drill can be held before the next emergency. We pause to reflect every Sept. 11, as we should. I propose setting aside a few hours on each anniversary of 9/11 for the city's first responders to conduct drills along with the rest of us. Tell us what to do. Tell us where to go, and how to get there. Raising public awareness honors the memories of the heroes who died that day even more than etching their names on a wall. Op-Ed Contributor Daniel M. Perez is a civil rights lawyer."
"For the first time, Palestinian militants destroyed an Israeli tank tonight, planting a mine that punched through the tank's belly, killing at least three soldiers and lightly wounding a fourth. The tank was ripped apart as it responded to what the Israeli Army described as a coordinated attack on a settlers' convoy after it entered the Gaza Strip headed for Netzarim, an isolated Jewish settlement. A bomb had exploded beside the settlers' bus, which was bulletproof, and gunmen opened fire on the convoy. No one was injured in that attack. But as the tank rushed to the scene, it rolled over the mine, which penetrated the tank and exploded inside, the army said. ''This is really warfare, in the conventional sense,'' said Jacob Dallal, an Israeli Army spokesman. ''This is something we've never seen before from the Palestinians.'' The Palestinian attack followed a sweeping Israeli incursion Wednesday into three Gaza towns during which soldiers killed five Palestinians. The Salahadin Brigade, a group composed of members of Hamas and Yasir Arafat's Fatah faction, claimed responsibility for the attack on the settler convoy in a statement sent to the Reuters news agency. The group said it was retaliating for the Israeli attack. The group is the military wing of the Popular Resistance Committees, a Fatah-dominated organization in the Gaza refugee camps. [Early Friday morning, Israeli tanks and troops raided a Palestinian-controlled village in the West Bank, killing one militant and arresting another, the Israeli Army said. [Israeli forces swept into Saida, north of the city of Tulkarm, just after dawn and came under fire from gunmen in the village, the army and witnesses told Reuters. The witnesses said troops demolished one house belonging to a member of the militant group Islamic Jihad.] The Israeli raid Wednesday was, in turn, a reponse to an attack Sunday that Israel called an escalation in the conflict: Two crude Hamas rockets, the first, were fired from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel. The army described the mine that exploded under the tank as similar to weapons used by the Lebanese group Hezbollah against Israeli forces in South Lebanon. Israel withdrew from Lebanon in May 2000. Israeli officials have expressed concern at what they describe as growing ties between Hezbollah, or Party of God, and Palestinian organizations, including Fatah. A clear threat of antitank weapons could force the Israeli military to rethink its tactics. Until now, Israeli soldiers seemed invulnerable as they moved through Palestinian-controlled territory inside armored vehicles. The attack occurred at about 9 p.m. along the road to Netzarim, a single lane of asphalt that cuts across a main north-south Gaza road at a junction that has been a main flashpoint of the 16-month conflict. The settlers' road passes through a no man's land of sandy soil gouged by tank treads. For scores of yards on either side, Palestinian orange groves have been leveled because, Israelis say, snipers were using them to hide. The tank was in that no man's land, about 60 yards south of the road, when it was blown up, the army said. ''We heard an explosion and saw a blue flash in the orchard area,'' the bus driver told Israeli television. The bus, which had not yet reached the junction, turned back to leave Gaza. The tank was a Merkava, the Israeli-made flagship vehicle of the army. Late tonight, the army was still trying to identify the dead soldiers. About 6,000 settlers live in 22 settlements in the Gaza Strip, surrounded by a million Palestinians. A few hundred live in Netzarim, a fenced and heavily guarded compound. Today, hours after completing its raid on the three Gaza towns, Beit Hanun, Beit Lahiya and Deir al-Balah, Israel released 16 of the 18 Palestinians arrested in the sweep. The operation was planned to round up militants and destroy factories that made the two Hamas rockets, known as Qassam-2's. The rockets fell into fields, injuring no one. The Israeli Army was sharply criticized in the press here today for responding so aggressively to the rocket firings. But Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, the defense minister, said that use of Qassam-2's ''crosses our red lines.'' Early this morning in Ramallah, in the West Bank, Mr. Arafat made up with a top security official with whom he clashed on Monday night, Palestinian officials said. A group of Palestinian officials intervened in the dispute and brought the security chief, Jibril Rajoub, to Mr. Arafat's compound at about 2:30 this morning to iron things out. The two men hugged, according to a knowledgeable Palestinian."
"Q. Could the bombing of Afghanistan have resulted in recent earthquakes there? A. There is only a remote possibility of a seismic effect from the reported bombing, said Dr. Arthur Lerner-Lam, an associate director at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. ''The energy of one ton of explosive is roughly equivalent to the energy released in an earthquake of magnitude 1.5 or 2,'' Dr. Lerner-Lam said, ''but that assumes a ton of dynamite exploded under ideal circumstances, in an enclosed cavern in hard rock.'' The energy released from a one-ton bomb would instead diffuse on the surface, he explained, because bombs are designed to destroy things on the surface, not to shake the rock below. Some bombs are made to destroy underground sites, he said, ''but in even the largest of these, the energy release is not large in comparison to a significant quake.'' ''However,'' Dr. Lerner-Lam noted, ''there is evidence that a large nuclear explosion can change stress fields in the earth's crust.'' Such changes can bring on some earthquake activity, or at least changes in the natural background seismicity, he said. ''But the punch line is, Afghanistan is among the most seismically active countries in the world, so such quakes are likely without large bombing campaigns, unless there are large nuclear explosions we don't know about.''

"The death toll from a truck explosion outside an ancient synagogue on Thursday rose to 13 today, including 8 German tourists. Further deaths are likely among those burned in the explosion, officials said. The authorities continue to investigate whether the explosion was an accident and have agreed to let the German authorities join the inquiry. The Tunisian tourism minister and the president's chief of state security visited the Ghriba Synagogue today to support Tunisia's Jewish population. Officials announced that the alley where the truck exploded would be closed to traffic permanently."
"An explosion in the bowels of a century-old industrial loft building shook a block in Chelsea like an earthquake yesterday, shattering walls, windows, offices and elevator shafts and injuring dozens, 12 critically, in a wind of flying debris and glass that evoked fears of a terrorist bombing. The blast erupted shortly before 11:30 a.m. in a basement where chemicals were stored and used under the 11-story building at 111-121 West 19th Street, between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue, city officials said. The force blew a hole in the facade, rushed up stairwells and shafts, ripped doors off hinges and sent bricks and window shards cascading onto the street. Witnesses told of a rumbling explosion that shook the building and ground, a black cloud of smoke that engulfed the block, and dazed and bleeding victims stumbling out into the rubble as firefighters from a station across the street rushed out and a small army of emergency vehicles wailed to the scene. About 75 people were evacuated or found their own way out of the building's warren of lofts and offices -- a collection of light industries, importers, dot-coms, printers and other enterprises. Hundreds of others, including many students from a nearby technical school, were removed from commercial buildings where windows had been blown in. Officials said that at least 42 people were injured, suffering broken bones, burns, severe gashes and trauma. They were taken to four Manhattan hospitals, where at least 10 -- most of whom had been in or near the basement explosion -- were still listed in critical condition last night, most with head wounds. To many workers and residents of Chelsea, the events that broke upon a rainy workday were fearfully reminiscent of Sept. 11, or of the recent terror wrought by suicide bombers in Israel. It was ''Take Your Daughter to Work Day,'' and many in the building and the neighborhood had children or young teenagers in tow. But Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and fire officials quickly ruled out any act of terrorism and said that the cause, while still under investigation, appeared to be traceable to recently delivered volatile chemicals owned by a tenant, Kaltech Industries Group, a sign manufacturing company that occupied three floors. ''There's absolutely no reason to think this is anything other than a tragic accident,'' the mayor said at the Seventh Battalion firehouse, looking out on a street strewn with cinder blocks, bricks, glass and the twisted wreckage of a sidewalk coffee cart. Curtains fluttered out shattered windows. Investigators who insisted on anonymity were more specific. They said the explosion might have been touched off by workers in the basement who were transferring chemicals used for etching from a leaky 55-gallon drum to another container. ''They were using an electric pump,'' one said, ''and they believe one container starts swelling, and they fled and then they heard the explosion.'' Another official, while stressing that the investigation was still early, said some chemical reaction might have occurred during the transfer process. ''There was a leaking or a hissing, as if the hose broke or ruptured or something like it's going to blow,'' the official said. ''They're looking at whether a chemical reaction may have produced some vapors that were ignited. That's where they're leaning now.'' Fire marshals and hazardous-materials investigators for the State Department of Environmental Conservation were trying to determine what chemicals were stored at the site. Kaltech was cited yesterday afternoon for four violations of the fire code, including improper storage of chemicals, fire officials said. A contractor who works at the building said he had often seen what he called volatile chemicals in an inadequately ventilated basement. J. R. Khalfan, one of two brothers who own Kaltech and is a company director, said he did not believe the chemicals were a cause of the explosion. While noting that he had not yet had access to the basement, he suggested that a boiler had exploded or that natural gas was involved. He said some witnesses described two distinct booms. ''We think it was the side boiler because of the double explosion,'' Mr. Khalfan said. ''It could be natural gas.'' Asked about early reports that a boiler had exploded, Mayor Bloomberg said that there had been recent work done on some boilers in the building. ''But these boilers have not been active for many years,'' he said, adding: ''This certainly was not a boiler explosion.'' Mr. Khalfan said the basement used by Kaltech contained about 20 machines for making signs -- cutters, silk-screening devices, acid etchers and other mechanisms -- but he said none were welding machines. He said that paint was kept in the basement, but insisted that it was nonflammable. Kaltech's general manager, Phil Morgan, who was in the ground-floor office, said he felt two consecutive blasts. ''One pushed me up from my chair, the second had me out of my chair,'' he told The Associated Press. When it was over, the ceiling and wall had fallen. ''Everything moved. The air was filled with dust.'' It was unclear late yesterday how many workers were in the basement, with reports ranging from 10 to 50, mostly immigrants who were making signs or silk screens, etching glass and performing other tasks, officials said. Francis X. Gribbon, a Fire Department spokesman, said marshals were interviewing witnesses and the injured, as well as officials of the building's management. Chaitram Singh, a Kaltech Industries employee who was in the basement, remembered little except a blinding flash and an overwhelming force. ''All I saw was dust and an explosion and I was out,'' he said, his left eye covered with a bandage. While the facade was damaged and several walls were blown out, the building appeared to be structurally sound, city officials said after an inspection. The tan brick structure, with airily wide loft windows, white stone trim and a row of lion-head cartouches, was designed in 1902 by William H. Hume for Simpson, Crawford & Simpson, a big store that was part of the Ladies Mile. Many witnesses said their first thoughts on hearing the explosion were of terrorists. ''All I thought was 'Oh God, 9/11,' '' said David Santiago, who works in a hardware store across the street. He said he ran out and saw victims stumbling toward him. ''They were all in a daze,'' he said. ''Some were cut in the head.'' The explosion occurred under the east side of the 100-foot-wide building, and did most of its damage there. No one was trapped in the basement, officials said, although ceilings and walls in the area surrounding the blast partly collapsed. The upward force also damaged three elevator shafts and various stairwells, offices and interior walls as well as shattering scores of windows. Chad Dougatz, a writer-editor for Launch, a Yahoo subsidiary, was in a second-floor office at the west end of the building. He said the blast, traveling up a freight elevator shaft, blew two heavy metal elevator doors off their hinges and across a 15-foot reception area. He and 17 other workers were briefly trapped by debris and evacuated out a window on a cherry picker. John Offermann, 47, an executive of Donovan Data Systems on West 18th Street, had taken his daughter, Karen, 11, to work with him, as eight others in his office did. The children, he said, ''were very frightened, obviously,'' but no one panicked. The explosion prevented mail delivery in the area for the day, and there were other effects, including a minor crisis for the producers of the Broadway revival of ''Into the Woods.'' Several of the show's costumes, taken in for alterations and cleaning, were left behind in the evacuation of a sixth floor shop. Rehearsal costumes were substituted, a show spokesman said. The timing was terrible, because critics and Tony Award nominators attended last night's performance."
"The sky went black. Papers went flying like pigeons. Workers went running into the streets. At half-past 11 yesterday morning, jittery New Yorkers returned for a brief moment to Sept. 11, transported there by an explosion in the basement of an industrial building that rocked Chelsea. The explosion at an 11-story commercial building on West 19th Street injured at least 42 people, including a coffee vendor who was sitting in his cart selling breakfast pastries in front of the building, the authorities said. The first floor facade blew off the building, and the cart was twisted like an aluminum can. A roar, a cascade of glass, a fountain of rubble. That's what residents on the street saw, and their first thoughts were terrorism. ''I thought, 'Oh no, what now?' '' said Kein Cross, who owns La Maison Moderne, a boutique down the block from the building. ''I was scared. The lady next door came out crying. She was worried about the firefighters next door. Five men died from there on Sept. 11. We didn't know.'' The surviving firefighters from that house, Engine 3 and Ladder 12, were first on the scene, and within minutes, 165 members of the Fire Department had responded, including men from the specialized hazardous materials and rescue companies. Radiation measurements were taken. There were dozens of police officers, city officials and a frenzied flock of reporters and photographers, some of whom were wearing hard hats. News helicopters hovered overhead. There was a priest ministering in the streets. There was little fire damage in the building, officials said, and an ambush attack on civilians briefly crossed the minds of some. ''There was a truck parked out front,'' said Deputy Chief John Coloe of the Fire Department. ''But later, you could see that it had the look of work-related explosion. Still, it's in the back of your mind.'' Officials investigating the cause have centered on volatile chemicals owned by Kaltech Industries, a tenant on three floors of the building. Mohammed Masood, a signmaker there, was working in the basement yesterday morning when he went to the ground floor for more glass, he said as he stood on 20th Street, his head and arms wrapped in bandages. He wore only a T-shirt, but no one thought to give him an umbrella. ''I was waiting for the elevator,'' Mr. Masood said. ''Something blew up downstairs, and the elevator came down on my head. Three of my friends were hurt very bad.'' J. R. Royal, a manager at Kaltech, said he had been in the office on the mezzanine when the explosion occurred. ''The ceiling collapsed on me,'' he said. ''I held the blocks and the lighting fixtures with my hands. I thought of my wife and kids and waited for another explosion. It didn't come, and I ran out.'' Outside the damaged building, cinder blocks and red bricks were strewn about. The six lower floors at the far eastern end of the building appeared to be blown out, with windows completely missing. Other windows were broken throughout the 11-story building, with curtains fluttering out through the broken glass. Rescuers removed the injured to the streets, laid them on aluminum gurneys and covered them with blankets to protect them from the steady rain. A Catholic priest was on site, resurrecting images of Sept 11. The priest knelt over the wounded. He comforted a man at the mouth of an ambulance. He patted his chest, then straightened his cap. There are no churches in the immediate area, so some of the employees in the building ran to the nearest sanctuary, the Peter McManus pub on 19th Street and Seventh Avenue. Most businesses in the area shut down for the day. Bed Bath & Beyond did not close its doors, however. A sign at 18th Street and the Avenue of the Americas, near the employees' entrance, read: ''Yes we're open.'' In the store's caf√©, people continued to eat pizza and watched the rescue effort. The explosion caused a minor crisis for the producers of the Broadway revival of ''Into the Woods.'' Several of the show's costumes were left behind when a costume shop next to the building was evacuated. Pieces of about five of the production's costumes had been delivered to the shop yesterday morning for alterations, cleaning and minor repairs. The timing could not have been worse for ''Into the Woods,'' which expected to have several dozen critics and Tony Award nominators at last night's preview. The show went on with the actors using their rehearsal costumes. Early yesterday afternoon, with the news that the explosion was not a terrorist act and word that nobody had died in the accident, some New Yorkers rediscovered their well-honed skepticism. As Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg arrived for a news conference, scores of reporters and photographers stampeded after him. ''The media,'' said a police officer at the barricades. ''Looks like Sept. 11 all over again. I'm going to be here all night.''"
"Steve Jaisingh and his brother-in-law, Ravie Ramkisson, were working in the basement of Kaltech Industries Group, a sign manufacturing company in Chelsea, when a co-worker saw smoke back near the freight elevator and started screaming for people to run. An explosion followed. ''I pulled him out,'' Mr. Jaisingh, 19, said of Mr. Ramkisson, who is 25. ''He was covered with brick and glass. I had to carry him. The firefighter came and he helped me.'' The brothers-in-law, who are from Trinidad, work at the sign-making business. Mr. Ramkisson, who lives in Brooklyn with his wife, was in critical condition last night at St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital with neck and back injuries. Of the dozens hurt in yesterday's explosion, among the most seriously injured were employees of Kaltech, which manufactures interior and exterior signs -- from huge sculptured logos that stand like sentries at the entrances of corporate headquarters to small interior placards that give directions to the nearest bathroom or elevator. One employee, Martin Salcedo, 34, came to the United States from Ecuador 10 years ago. For the past eight years he has worked at Kaltech. Yesterday, Mr. Salcedo, a father of three who lives in Astoria, Queens, was holding a piece of a glass sign when the explosion shook the building at 111-121 West 19th Street. Mr. Salcedo suffered a laceration to his face that sliced a nerve, a major wound on his shoulder and a skull fracture. He also remained in critical condition last night at St. Vincent's. Fire Department officials said that the blast appeared to have originated in the basement of the building and that some Kaltech employees might have been transferring volatile chemicals, used for etching, from one 55-gallon drum to another at the time of the blast. The victims with the worst injuries were identified as Zehem Ahmed, who suffered facial burns; Francis Parone, 45, who suffered head injuries; and Lech Wojciechowski, 47, who suffered back injuries, police officials said. All three were in critical condition at St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital. Of 10 victims brought to St. Vincent's, six were men in critical condition with life-threatening injuries from burns to severe fractures and head wounds, said Dr. Richard Westfall, the hospital's associate chairman of emergency medicine. A firefighter, William McCarthy, was reported in stable condition with a minor back injury. Two women were also brought to the hospital, with minor injuries, Dr. Westfall said. One of those, Katherine Baerga, 27, an expediter at Berzak Gold, an architectural firm on the 10th floor, sprained her ankle when she had to jump from a third-story window onto the roof of a nearby building. She was on the phone with her mother when she heard a loud bang, and she went out into the hallway to investigate. ''That's when I saw a huge cloud of black smoke, and maintenance workers were screaming to get out,'' she said. She was stopped on the third floor and directed to the roof of the nearby building. ''I was horrified,'' she said. ''I was trying to assist another person from down the hall who was hysterical. I inhaled a lot of smoke.'' A pregnant woman and a man walking with crutches were also trying to escape, Ms. Baerga said. She was treated and released. At Bellevue Hospital Center, officials said they had treated six victims, all men, three of whom were in serious but stable condition last night. Dr. Robert Hessler, the assistant director of the emergency department at Bellevue, said the victims had suffered broken bones, cuts and bruises, but all seemed to be alert when they arrived at the hospital."
"A French oil tanker was on fire off the southeastern coast of Yemen after an explosion this morning as it headed for an oil terminal in the Gulf of Aden. By late tonight, the cause of the blast aboard the tanker Limburg was still unclear, but the incident immediately raised fears that terrorists had attacked one of the most vulnerable links in the oil-dependent global economy two years after an explosive-filled boat in nearby waters ripped a hole in the United States Navy destroyer Cole. French diplomats and executives at the company that owns the tanker were quoted in early news agency reports as saying that they suspected a terrorist attack by a small boat that reportedly approached the tanker shortly before the explosion. Yemeni officials, however, denied that there had been an attack and said the small boat had been sent to guide the tanker into port. ''We in Paris have no clue,'' said a senior French official here monitoring the investigation. ''We fear that it is a terrorist act, but we probably need a couple of more days to see what happened.'' In Washington, United States military officials said they had not yet received solid indications that the tanker blast was the work of terrorists and, at least temporarily, were classifying the incident as a shipboard accident. ''Reports of a terrorist attack are, at this point, conjecture,'' an American military officer said. All but one of the tanker's 25 crew members were rescued from the ship, which sent an inky plume into the sky and thousands of barrels of black oil into the sea. The French Embassy in Yemen said 12 crew members were hospitalized in the port city of Mukalla. Even if the blast turns out to be an accident, the snap suggestion that terrorists were to blame is a measure of the anxiety in the region. Yemen is Osama bin Laden's ancestral home, and some reports have placed him in the mountains there, where he is reported to have once said he would like to live. The explosion today occurred just one week before the two-year anniversary of the attack on the Cole, which killed 17 American sailors and has been blamed on Al Qaeda, Mr. bin Laden's terrorist network. Maritime companies had been alerted early last month to possible terror attack on ships in the region. In advance of the Sept. 11 anniversary of the attacks in New York and Washington, Navy officials in Bahrain, home to the United States Fifth Fleet, issued an advisory to shipping lines warning of possible strikes by Al Qaeda against oil tankers. Successful attacks on lumbering, oil-heavy tankers would be likely to roil world financial markets and could raise oil prices and batter confidence in a global economic system already shaken by the terrorist attacks in the United States last year and the prospect of a winter war in Iraq. The Middle East accounts for more than half of the world's oil exports, including more than 90 percent of Asian crude oil imports and one-third of American and European net crude oil imports. But it is unlikely the impact of such a terrorist campaign would last very long. ''This is really a scare story,'' said Gary Ross, chief executive of Pira Energy Group, a New York-based oil-industry consulting firm. ''It would put everyone on heightened alert and raise insurance rates, but it wouldn't materially affect supply.'' During the so-called ''tanker war'' of the 1980's, when Iran and Iraq attacked oil tankers in the Persian Gulf in an attempt to damage each other's economies, insurers raised war risk insurance premiums for ships sailing into the gulf by 50 percent at one point but oil prices barely budged. Since the Cole attack, Yemen has tried to assure the world that it is not a haven for Al Qaeda. It arrested more than 100 suspected members of the terrorist network and other Islamist groups in the months after Sept. 11, 2001, and has sent military patrols to hunt for Qaeda members in the mountains. Last month, Yemeni security forces killed one man and seized four other suspected Qaeda members following a shootout in a northern suburb of Sana, the capital. Other suspected members got away. Meanwhile, the Yemeni government has said it plans to put suspected accomplices in the Cole attack on trial in the next few days. The Limburg, leased by the Malaysian state oil company Petronas, was carrying 397,000 barrels of crude oil from the Kharg Island terminal in Iran and was preparing to take on 1.5 million more barrels of Yemeni crude at an offshore terminal near the Red Sea port of Mina al-Dabah. The French-registered ship, which weighs 298,997 tons when fully loaded, is owned by Euronav, a subsidiary of the Belgian firm Compagnie Maritime Belge. It has a crew of eight French citizens and seven Bulgarians. One Bulgarian was reported missing. President Jacques Chirac of France placed a telephone call to Yemen's president, Ali Abdallah Saleh, thanking him for the efforts to save the tanker's crew, Reuters reported. Mr. Chirac said French investigators would go to Yemen to join local experts in examining the tanker. Correction: October 8, 2002, Tuesday An article yesterday about an explosion on a French tanker approaching a Yemeni oil terminal misstated the number of Bulgarians among the crew. It was 17, not 7. With the eight French crew members, they brought the total to 25, as given in the article. Correction: October 18, 2002, Friday Because of an editing error, an article on Oct. 7 about an explosion on the French supertanker Limburg off Yemen confused two ways of measuring the ship's size. The Limburg weighs 341,097 tons fully loaded; 298,997 tons is its deadweight tonnage, or the total possible weight of its cargo, fuel, stores and everything else removable from the ship."
"A series of bombs shook this sprawling black community early today, killing one person and wounding another in what the police suspect was a coordinated strike by white extremists. The string of nine explosions, which began just after midnight, would be the first attack by radical whites since apartheid ended in 1994, the authorities said. In recent months, concern has mounted about the activities of such groups. At least 15 white men have been arrested this year in a crackdown on right-wing extremists plotting the overthrow of the government. Earlier this month, the police uncovered thousands of rounds of ammunition, dozens of grenades and 16 homemade bombs, which police believe were part of one such plot. No one argues that these conspiracies are the work of anything more than a tiny fringe of the country's white population, but today's explosions may be the first evidence that extremists are willing to carry out their violent plots. While no one believes that the extremists can unseat the country's black-led government, their random, racially charged violence could do damage, reviving old fears and tensions and resurrecting images of a country at war with itself. President Thabo Mbeki said the country's people, black and white, were united against such terror and would not succumb to efforts of ''extreme right-wing racist groups'' to sow dissension. ''They will not succeed,'' he told reporters in Cape Town today. ''The problem is that they claim lives of innocent people.'' Another explosion, late this morning at a Buddhist temple near the capital, Pretoria, may also be connected to the bombings here in Soweto, but investigators were not able to immediately establish a conclusive link. The wave of blasts began at about midnight when a succession of bombs exploded at a commuter rail station and along the tracks a few hundred yards away, according to police accounts. About 20 minutes later, an explosion rocked the Soweto Mosque, the police said. The blast blew out the sanctuary's windows and ripped a huge hole in the side of the attached mosque school, leaving a mess of rubble and shattered glass all around. ''I just heard the blast when we were asleep,'' said Rodney Zulu, 32, who lives across the street from the mosque and whose windows were blown out by the explosion. ''First, we thought it was the criminals. Then when we went out, we saw the dust and glass. We just ran away to the next street.'' Over the next few hours, at least two more bombs exploded at train stations around Soweto, which sits just south of Johannesburg and is the country's largest black township. The rail stations were deserted in those early hours of the day, but that did not keep the bombs from taking at least one life. Debris from one of the train station blasts came crashing through the roof of a tin shack hundreds of yards away, killing a woman and injuring her husband. While many senior officials tried to avoid sounding too definitive about the direction of the investigation, they made it clear that they do not believe the bombings are a mystery. ''This is a big organization,'' Jackie Selebi, the national police commissioner, told Parliament today. ''We have attempted in the past to control this. We will do everything in our power to make sure, to ensure that the bombs don't explode. We calculate that there are many more bombs than those that have exploded.'' Commissioner Selebi said that shortly before the explosions began, two white men were seen ''acting suspiciously'' a couple of blocks from the mosque, near an old filling station now used as a parking lot for commuter minibuses. According to people at the parking lot today, the guards on duty last night saw the white men place a package underneath one of the minibuses. Curious, the guards examined the package and found what appeared to be a bomb. A passing police car was flagged down and the officers in turn summoned the bomb squad, which disabled the device. Minutes later, the rest of the bombs began exploding. ''They targeted the entire black community,'' Ubada Ntshinyane, chairman of the Soweto Muslim Association, said as he stood outside the damaged house of worship. The attacks left the community -- and the country -- anxious and angry. Political violence was all too common here during the anti-apartheid struggle, but that, most of the country assumed, was over. Martin Schonteich, a senior researcher at the Institute for Security Studies, said that even with their anxieties about the current government, few Afrikaners supported the sort of action undertaken today. ''Amongst Afrikaners, there's a lot of apprehension about what the future might hold for them in terms of affirmative action and land reform,'' he said. ''But support for any kind of violent action is limited to a group of fringe individuals.'' Even so, as long as such extremists are out there, they are likely to remain a threat, he said. ''I don't think we've seen the last violent act,'' Mr. Schonteich said. ''There was a certain level of planning and coordination. It would make very little sense to just stop now.'' Pieter Mulder, the leader of the Freedom Front, a political party that represents right-wing Afrikaners, said that many Afrikaners felt frustrated. But he deplored violence as a way of dealing with grievances. ''The Freedom Front has said more than once that we made a decision in 1994 that we're not going to use violence to reach our goals,'' Mr. Mulder said today on state television. ''Therefore, we're in Parliament,'' he said. ''Therefore, we chose the constitutional road in 1994. That's still the way we see it and the way that we're going to solve our problems. We don't think violence will work.''"
"The French government said tonight that the explosion that crippled a French supertanker in Yemen on Sunday was most likely caused by a terrorist attack. The preliminary conclusion was made after a team of French, American and Yemeni technical experts examined a hole in the side of the tanker, the Limburg, and decided that the damage probably was caused by an external blast that drove a hole inward, French officials said. One crew member was killed and 12 others injured in the attack. ''Initial results of the investigation, carried out by French, Yemeni and American specialists, lead us to believe that the October 6 blast on the French oil tanker Limburg was due to an attack,'' a Foreign Ministry statement said. A senior French official added, ''The evidence so far points to an attack.'' The French statement said that further investigation was necessary to ''verify those initial results and determine the exact causes of the explosion.'' One of the French inspectors, Jean-Fran√ßois Perrouty, was quoted by the Reuters news agency in Yemen as saying that debris that could have come from an attacking boat had been found. ''We found debris of a boat that obviously does not belong to the tanker,'' he said. Yemen was the site of a deadly attack on the American destroyer Cole in the southern port of Aden nearly two years ago that killed 17 sailors. The attack, which was carried out with a boat filled with explosives, was blamed on Al Qaeda. The Foreign Ministry said it had asked all French diplomatic and consular posts in the region to reinforce their security measures to protect French citizens and that the French Navy was looking into ways to better protect French ships in the region. The officials said they have not yet determined who is responsible for the attack. The Arab-language newspaper Al-Sharq al-Awsat reported today that it had received a communiqu√© from the Aden-Abyan Islamic Army, a Yemeni fundamentalist group, claiming responsibility. After the initial conclusion of the inquiry was announced, Agence France-Presse reported that its office in the Persian Gulf emirate of Dubai had received a statement from the group saying that one of its ''squadrons'' attacked the Limburg, which was ''going to supply the Fifth Fleet for striking the brothers in Iraq.'' The United States' Fifth Fleet is based in Bahrain. The statement said that the target had not been the French tanker but an unnamed United States Navy frigate that was in the area. It added that there was no difference ''because the unbelievers' nation is one,'' the agency reported. The statement carried no heading and was dated Tuesday. French officials said that they had no knowledge of the group or whether it was involved in the attack. Another senior French official said today that his government was taking very seriously a purported voice recording of Ayman al-Zawahiri, the second-ranking Qaeda leader, broadcast on the Al Jazeera satellite television network Tuesday. In the broadcast, Mr. Zawahiri threatened continued attacks on ''America and its allies,'' and added, ''We have sent messages to allies of America to stop their involvement in the American crusade.'' Last month, the United States Navy warned of possible attacks by Al Qaeda on tankers in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, which carry about one-third of all global oil trade. Civilian tankers daily move in and out of the waters in the region with no escorts or military protection. Capt. Fran√ßois Detavernier, the marine manager for France Shipmanagement, the parent company of the owners of the Limburg, said that the firm suspected all along that terrorism caused the explosion. ''Our point of view has always been the same,'' he said. ''The boat has been attacked.'' Hubert Ardillon, the ship's captain, said in Yemen that photographs of the ship's metal hull proved that it was blown inwards, not outwards, as would have beeen the case if the explosion had been caused by a malfunction inside the tanker. ''I've studied the photographs that clearly show the hull is blown in, not out,'' Captain Ardillon said, according to Bloomberg news agency. ''It doesn't make sense for it to be anything other than an external explosion.'' Yemen, which has struggled to shed its image as a haven for Islamic militants ever since the attack on the Cole, had insisted since Sunday that the explosion was caused by an accidental fire. But in a news conference today, Yemen's transport minister, Saeed Yafai, said it was possible that the explosion that carved a hole in the ship's hull had been deliberate. ''We are not ruling out anything, but we don't want to take a hasty decision before the end of the investigation,'' Mr. Yafai said. THREATS AND RESPONSES: EXPLOSION IN YEMEN"
"On most any other morning, Mikhail Avulov would have been in his Upper East Side tailor shop, stitching the clothes of actors, bankers and others from the neighborhood who have sustained his business for six years now. But yesterday, Mr. Avulov, 40, stood in the cold across the street from the charred remains of his store, Michael's Tailor Shop on East 70th Street, and shook his head. Burned shirts and sewing machines were strewn on the curb. At 7:30 a.m., Mr. Avulov's shop was firebombed and destroyed. When word came later that his 21-year-old nephew, Artur Avulov, a former employee, had been arrested for the crime -- and was the sole person injured in the fire and the subsequent explosion, which blew out the windows of a neighboring coffee shop -- Mikhail Avulov was listless and perplexed. ''It is a big question to me,'' he said. ''I don't know why he would do that. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.'' As police and fire officials sifted through the ashen contents of the one-story shop set between Neil's Coffee Shop, on the corner of Lexington Avenue, and the Manhattan High School for Girls, on East 70th Street, a steady stream of onlookers stopped to survey the scorched results of the violence. At one point, a woman in a camel-colored coat and red lipstick, clutching a Chihuahua dressed in a matching tan and red sweater, arrived at the scene and stood in front of a store called A Perfect Day in Paradise. She asked, of no one in particular: ''What's going on? What happened?'' A man with two black and white Boston terriers on separate leashes answered that he had heard a noise in his apartment that startled him and drew his attention to the street. ''All of a sudden, I saw all this smoke and flames shoot out of the building, instantly,'' said the man, who declined to identify himself but said his dogs were named Gigi and Coco. The police said witnesses saw Artur Avulov, armed with a canister, pass through a broken front gate about 7:30 a.m. and walk into the store. Two or three minutes later, they watched him walk out -- and then, suddenly, the store erupted in flames, said Sergeant Fred Manzolillo of the Police Department's Arson and Explosion Squad. ''The force of it actually pushed him out the gates and onto the sidewalk,'' Sgt. Manzolillo said. ''There are a number of reasons why an explosion could occur.'' Investigators had not yet identified a motive in the case late yesterday, the police said. Fire and police officials were still searching the rubble to try to find the canister and to determine whether it was filled with gasoline or another accelerant. The explosion blew out the windows of Neil's, where about 20 people were eating or serving breakfast, witnesses said. Half-eaten eggs and toast were left behind as people ran out the door. ''It's always amazing when nobody gets killed,'' said a firefighter, George Baade. ''That's what we're here for.'' In the confusion, Artur Avulov, his face and body singed, hailed a livery cab but was waylaid by two workers from a Yonkers-based carpet company who happened to see him and held him until police officers arrived, Sgt. Manzolillo said. The suspect was taken to New York Weill Cornell Center, where he was listed in stable condition yesterday, said John D. Rodgers, a hospital spokesman. The police later charged him with second-degree arson and burglary. At his home in Forest Hills, Mikhail Avulov said he had come to the United States with his wife and children from a town near Tashkent, Uzbekistan, a decade ago. His brother Boris and Boris's son, Artur, followed about two years ago, he said. For about a year, Mikhail Avulov said, Artur worked at Michael's Tailor Shop as his understudy. But he had to let the young man go about a year ago, he said, mostly because he was ''a troubled kid'' who used to sleep on the job. He gestured putting a needle in his arm. It was a month ago when he last saw his nephew, who came to his house for an insurance card for a car, Mikhail said, adding that he had first resisted but then handed it over. That day, he said, he offered to take his nephew to a hospital. ''I said, 'If you need help, I'll help, I'll help you,'' Mr. Avulov said. ''I said, 'Come tomorrow and we'll go together.' He said he'd meet me, but he never came.''"
"The Israeli military admitted tonight that it was a shot fired by one of its soldiers that killed a senior United Nations official on Friday at the agency's compound in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank. But the admission was spiked with a countercharge that seemed likely to increase friction between the government here and the United Nations, angry at the death of the official, Iain John Hook, a 54-year-old Briton who oversaw the rebuilding of part of the camp. The Israeli statement, released late tonight, said Palestinian gunmen had been firing at soldiers from inside the small United Nations compound -- a potentially serious accusation given the implication that United Nations officials were sheltering the gunmen in some way. An Israeli soldier then fired at Mr. Hook inside the compound when he saw ''an object which resembles a pistol'' in his hand, the statement read. Earlier today, the Israeli Army radio reported that the soldier mistook a cellphone Mr. Hook was carrying for a hand grenade. A United Nations spokesman said Mr. Hook was trying to evacuate staff members after a gunfight erupted near the agency's compound, Reuters reported. The spokesman, Paul McCann, said that based on the agency's preliminary inquiry ''the report of firing from the compound is totally incredible.'' Earlier in the day, another spokesman for the United Nations sharply questioned the army radio reports that the soldier believed Mr. Hook to be carrying a grenade. ''We don't find this argument to be convincing,'' said the spokesman, Sami Mshasha. On Friday, the United Nations here also accused Israel of delaying an ambulance sent to evacuate Mr. Hook, a concern echoed in New York by the secretary general, Kofi Annan. Military officials have denied the charge. Radio reports said today that Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed regrets over Mr. Hook's death in a telephone call to the British foreign minister, Jack Straw. There is a long history of tension between Israel and the United Nations, which Israel considers to be more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, and specifically with the agency that Mr. Hook worked for: the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, created to administer Palestinian refugee camps set up after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Mr. Hook died on a day in which the Israeli military moved into the Jenin camp to arrest a suspected member of the militant Islamic Jihad. Witnesses said a gun battle then broke out between soldiers and Palestinian gunmen, though the statement tonight was the first saying gunmen were firing from in and around the United Nations compound. Mr. Hook's death came during the scattered violence after a suicide attack in Jerusalem on Thursday killed 11 Israelis, 4 of them children. In response, the Israeli military again seized control of Bethlehem, where the bomber lived, a move that in effect re-established nearly full Israeli control of the West Bank. Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the bus attack, as did another militant group, Hamas. Islamic Jihad said today that it had carried out an unusual attack at sea: On Friday night, two Palestinian militants exploded their fishing boat near an Israeli patrol vessel off the Gaza Strip, wounding four Israeli soldiers and killing the Palestinians. An Israeli military spokesman said the incident began after a navy patrol boat spotted a small fishing boat in waters where fishing is not permitted. The spokesman said the patrol boat first tried to make contact with the people in the fishing boat, then fired warning shots and blasted the boat with water hoses to move it out of the forbidden zone. Then, he said, ''there was a loud explosion.'' Three soldiers were ''moderately'' wounded, he said, and one suffered slight injuries. The patrol boat was also damaged. Islamic Jihad released a statement in Lebanon identifying the bombers on the boat as Jamal Ali Ismail, 21, and Muhammad Samih al-Masri, 19, both of the West Bank."
"Laura Gidayatova was at her stall in the outdoor market of this Caspian seaside town on Thursday, hawking the flowers that countless folks were laying on the graves of World War II veterans, when the distant rumble of an explosion washed over the vendors. She paid it little mind. This was Victory Day, the anniversary of Russia's defeat of Nazi Germany 57 years ago, and noisy celebration was to be expected. She learned the truth only when a neighbor arrived bearing the clothes of her own 5-year-old daughter, Zuriat. ''They were soaked in blood,'' Ms. Gidayatova said today, two days after the event. ''I said, 'Where is she?' and she said, 'She's in the hospital.' '' Zuriat had wandered onto Lenin Street to watch the annual parade when a bomb packed with plastic explosive and metal bits detonated just yards away, spraying her face and chest with shrapnel. She was in Kaspisk's dilapidated city hospital today, swathed in bandages. Anwar Gasanov, 14, had been standing with about 10 teenage friends, waiting to join the procession. Today he lay just down the hall from Zuriat, his left arm and right shoulder tightly wrapped after surgery to extract shrapnel. One of his friends died on the spot. A second lost a leg and died hours later. ''The person who did this,'' said Anwar's mother, Kistaman Gasanova, ''could not have been born of a mother.'' The special horror of the bomb here in the Russian republic of Dagestan is not the total number of those killed but the number of children who died. Of at least 41 deaths recorded so far, 17 were children. Thirty more children were wounded. The authorities said today that the bomb appeared to be an antipersonnel mine, detonated by remote control. The question on virtually everyone's lips in this city of 70,000 was what kind of person could destroy so many young lives. For the answer, Russian government investigators look to the slow-burning guerrilla war that has consumed the next-door republic, Chechnya, since 1999. Prosecutors arrested three men in St. Petersburg on Friday, saying there were ''very strong arguments'' that they and others, inside and outside Russia, were linked to the blast. Nikolai Patrushev, the director of the Federal Security Service, Russia's domestic intelligence agency, said the bombers were ''linked first of all to Wahhabism,'' the sect of Islam that has played a growing role in the war in Chechnya. But he and prosecutors declined to make public their evidence, saying the case was still being built. Three weeks ago, the security service announced with some fanfare that it had liquidated an Arab guerrilla known as Khattab, the leader of Islamic militants who are waging at least part of the Chechen war. One possibility discussed this week was that the Kaspisk blast had been set off in retaliation for Khattab's death or to demonstrate the rebels' resolve to continue the battle. In addition to the toll among the young, at least 18 servicemen, many of them in a marching band, and at least 6 civilians were killed. There were indications that a principal target may have been about 10 senior military officers who were marching behind the band and in front of a column of flower-bearing children. At least three lieutenant colonels and a major from that group were killed, officials said today. Dagestan's deputy health minister, Paizula Magomedov, said in an interview today that about 160 people had been wounded. Mr. Magomedov said Kaspisk's hospital, clean but falling apart after a decade of deferred repairs and puny budgets, had been overwhelmed by the flood of wounded. ''We have enough medicine,'' he said. ''But what we are lacking is equipment -- for anesthesia, respiratory equipment, monitors for pulse and blood pressure,'' he said, equipment that is ''very important for getting people out of critical condition.'' This town has been bombed before. An explosion in November 1996, still unsolved, collapsed a military apartment house, killing 68. But the tragedy of Thursday has left residents here reeling, because it struck down children from all over town. Virtually every class in every school was assigned a role for Victory Day. School No. 1 absorbed the greatest blow: seven deaths, mostly eighth-graders who were carrying wreaths to the cemetery. The city Gymnasium, a public preparatory school of 900 students, lost two students. School No. 6 lost three; the city Mechanical-Technical School lost one. The explosion threw its worst shrapnel in a low arc through the band and across the street. Anwar Gasanov, who was standing, escaped with minor wounds. A schoolmate sitting on the curb died instantly. Today, a 30-by-30-foot square of Lenin Street was roped off with red plastic tape and surrounded by hundreds of mourners. The square was filled with hundreds of flowers. ''For us, after our great Soviet Union has fallen apart, this is the only day we hold dear,'' Murtuz Murtazliyev, the Gymnasium vice principal, said as he at the bomb scene on Friday evening. ''Every class is schooled in this. And every class prepared wreaths and flowers. ''Those wreaths and flowers were meant for soldiers' graves,'' he said. ''Now they are here.''"
"At least 14 people, most of them French, were killed and more than 20 seriously wounded today when a suicide car-bomber pulled a red Toyota alongside a shuttle bus in front of the Sheraton Hotel in downtown Karachi and exploded it. The bus, operated by the Pakistani Navy, had stopped at the hotel to pick up the French civilians working on a submarine project for the Pakistani government. Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, called the bombing an ''act of international terrorism,'' and President Jacques Chirac of France said it was a ''murderous, cowardly, odious terrorist attack.'' There was no claim of responsibility, but Western and Pakistani officials said the bombing had all the markings of an operation of the sort carried out by Al Qaeda, and they warned of more attacks. The attack, coming two months after a suicide bomber killed five people, including two Americans, in an attack on a church here in the capital, represented an ominous shift in the method, magnitude and targets of terrorist attacks in this country. Sectarian violence has been nearly endemic here -- a lawyer, a high-school principal and a doctor have been killed in the latest wave of killing -- but suicide bombings have been extremely rare. Moreover, in the past, the targets have been Pakistanis, Iranians or Americans. Today's attack, along with the attack on the church, which is in the diplomatic compound, were aimed ''at the Western community,'' said a Western diplomat. ''Any place where foreigners gather is now vulnerable,'' he added. The two attacks appear to be linked, Pakistani officials said. The Western diplomat referred to them as ''a one-two'' and called today's attack ''very well planned.'' The American Embassy in Islamabad warned American citizens in the country ''to maintain a low profile and avoid predictable patterns and behaviors.'' There was no apparent link between the bombing and the trial of four men who are accused of the kidnapping and murder of the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, which resumed today in Hyderabad, about 100 miles northeast of Karachi. The trial had been moved from Karachi for security reasons. Once again, the trial, which prosecutors had originally said would be finished by mid-April, was put off, as defense lawyers sought to have the case moved back to Karachi. There were fears that more attacks were likely here, aimed at foreigners and at the government of General Musharraf, who has sided with the United States in the war on terrorism. ''This may not be the end,'' Pakistan's minister of information, Nisar A. Memon, said at a news conference here this evening. ''It appears their nefarious designs will continue.'' He said he was not basing the warning on any specific intelligence but on the ''historic facts in the last few months.'' Today's attack raises fundamental questions about security here, and serious challenges for General Musharraf, diplomats and Pakistani political analysts said. ''If the government of Pakistan can't protect workers in the defense industry, what does it say for its security?'' said one diplomat. The diplomat said General Musharraf must act decisively, within in the next two or three days. ''If I were him, I would crack down with a vengeance,'' the diplomat said. In an impoverished country already on the ropes economically, today's attack has caused ''enormous damage,'' he said. ''Who is going to invest here now?'' he said. A senior Pakistani official agreed. ''He has to act and act quickly,'' the official said, referring to General Musharraf. ''We have to do more than issue a press release.'' But the measures announced by the government after General Musharraf met with his security advisers seemed modest and suggested how difficult it will be to prevent suicide attacks in this country, which has a long, porous border with Afghanistan and whose police officers are poorly trained and underpaid. The government said that it was beefing up its intelligence gathering and security at places where foreigners gather, which is what the government said after the church attack two months ago. Today, the government also established a toll-free hot line for people to report suspicious terrorist activity, and a Web site: www.geocities.com/wantedforterrorism. Today's attack would also seem to underscore questions that have been asked recently about just how effective General Musharraf has been in his declared war on violent Muslim groups here. The president has banned several groups, and authorities have rounded up about 2,000 men suspected of links to terrorist organizations. But nearly three-quarters of those arrested have been released and not a single person has been charged. ''This raises fundamental questions about his follow-up,'' one diplomat said. After the church bombing, the government promised a swift investigation and a report that was to have been finished by early April. But the report has not been released, and the authorities appear no closer to solving the crime. The identity of the man who blew himself up remains a mystery. Parts of his body have been sent to the United States, and Pakistan has asked for help in recreating his face and body. ''The investigation is resting there,'' the senior civil officer in the Ministry of Interior, Tasnim Noorani, said at today's news conference."
"WHEN the sun sets on another Fourth of July, a phrase coined by Francis Scott Key takes on a meaning that he never intended. His ''rockets' red glare'' was a powerful reference to warfare. But to a modern audience, it describes the oooh and ahhh moments of a holiday fireworks display. Since the discovery of black powder more than 10 centuries ago, fireworks displays have been a mix of art and science. Knowledge of burn rates and ballistics has long been used to create choreographed explosions of stars, flowers and other patterns in the sky. But these days, computers have been added to the mix. Where fireworks displays of old were ignited by using flaming torches, today's displays are fired electrically from a safe distance. And the choreography is often handled by a computer, which delivers firing cues with split-second precision in time with music. Most established fireworks companies, like Fireworks by Grucci of Brookhaven, N.Y., Zambelli Fireworks of New Castle, Pa., Alonzo Fireworks of Mechanicville, N.Y., and Bartolotta Fireworks of Genesee, Wis., have adopted the latest technology largely because it makes their work much safer. The companies must combine their backgrounds in explosives, electronics and artistic expression with a healthy dose of project management and painstaking attention to detail. ''It's very laborious and time-consuming to produce a 15- or 24-minute program,'' said Phil Grucci, an executive vice president at Fireworks by Grucci. ''The scripting alone takes one hour per minute of fireworks that you see in the sky.'' Such painstaking work costs money: from about $5,000 for a basic show in a small town to $100,000 or more for an extravaganza like the display sponsored by Macy's that Grucci and a California company, Pyro Spectaculars by Souza, are producing tonight over the East River. Whether it is large or small, a successful fireworks display begins many months before the celebration itself. When a company or a town approaches a pyrotechnic enterprise, it usually has only a basic idea of what it wants. It knows what is being celebrated and may have some tunes in mind for a musical score, but the fireworks company does the rest. A pyrotechnic choreographer plans the show, starting with its theme, sometimes incorporating a musical score that may be broadcast from a local radio station, and taking into account the stage -- whether it is river barges (as is the case with the Macy's show), a rooftop or a ball field. Like many designers, pyrotechnicians use software to realize their visions. The Photoshop of the pyrotechnic world is FireOne, a software and hardware system developed by Pyrotechnics Management of State College, Pa. This system, based on Windows, does not look like much: it presents a timeline running from left to right with dots to represent when fireworks go off. But it allows for very precise firing times and cuts down on time-consuming paperwork by generating reports to coordinate each step of the show. Of course, like many designers, pyrotechnicians take pains to explain that their shows are not created by machine. ''All our shows are scripted on a computer,'' Mr. Grucci said. ''But they're scripted by the sense and emotion. The computer is just a very powerful tool.'' Software-based scripting makes it easier, for example, to synchronize a fireworks show to a recorded musical score. Music has played a big part in fireworks displays for centuries: King George II commissioned the ''Music for the Royal Fireworks'' concerto from George Frideric Handel nearly 30 years before Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence. But matching a musical crescendo to a volley of fireworks is easier with a mouse to click. Fireworks companies also have to determine what effects to use when. Larger companies like Fireworks by Grucci and Alonzo Fireworks design and manufacture their own fireworks and have catalogs of thousands of designs. ''Professional Roman candles give you crisscross patterns, silver fountains spread out, and mines shoot flames up from a tube,'' said Jeff Alonzo, vice president of Alonzo Fireworks. ''You spread them across a field for a wall of fire. That clears out the sky above for the bigger stuff, the aerial shells.'' Once the scripting is complete and the project gets the go-ahead from the sponsors, project management becomes the priority. A large display like the Macy's show can include 20,000 separate fireworks that must be made by hand, stored and shipped -- all with extreme care. Each is housed in a hand-rolled paper tube or ball called a shell, equipped with a fuse. The basic ingredient in fireworks is black powder, a mixture of saltpeter (potassium nitrate), charcoal and sulfur. Other chemicals are added for colors (like strontium nitrate or strontium carbonate to give a rocket its red glare). The fabrication process is meticulous both for safety's sake and because specialty shells need to be pieced together precisely. Some shells contain balls of chemicals arranged to explode into patterns or even letters. Others have more than one stage, with compartments of different explosive chemicals separated by cardboard disks and connected by slow fuses. Once they are made, the shells are stored in a bank of trailers separated by huge protective mounds of sand until they are ready to ship to the site of the show. For this reason, fireworks are typically stored in huge compounds. Even a comparatively small, new operation like Bartolotta Fireworks (a 25-year veteran in an industry where some other ''newcomers'' are 70 years old) takes up 43 acres in Wisconsin. Grucci, which traces its expertise back 150 years to a forebear in Bari, Italy, moved to a 92-acre site in Brookhaven in 1985, two years after an explosion destroyed its factory in Bellport, N.Y., and killed two people. The company has since added a second plant on 1,500 acres in Virginia. As the date of the show approaches, technical and setup crews must also travel to the site of the display. Fire marshals, the police, and local government must be kept in the loop. And after the show, everything must be cleared up. Because the bulk of the work involves the July 4 holiday -- it is not unusual for a single company to produce as many as 70 Independence Day shows -- there is a huge seasonal demand for workers skilled in pyrotechnics. Alonzo Fireworks, for example, has fewer than 20 year-round employees, but its staff swells to 400 with the approach of summer. ''Luckily, I've got a lot of cousins,'' Mr. Alonzo said. ''It's definitely a part-time job, but most of the guys are good about giving their time.'' Like other companies, Alonzo holds training classes in the spring. Once a show begins, the atmosphere is a little reminiscent of Broadway: it's all about cues. While the shells in most smaller displays are launched by flicking switches by hand on a central firing console, about three-quarters of larger displays use computer-based firing scripts to automate the process, with a laptop computer sending firing data to the console through a serial connection. ''All the creativity, all the information about the type of fireworks being used, that's all academic during the show,'' said Dan Barker, president of Pyrotechnics Management, maker of FireOne software. ''All the firing system needs to know is 'Where?' and 'What time?' '' Connecting the firing system to the actual fireworks themselves is a thick bundle of wires fanning out into a pattern called ''the web.'' On cue, the main console sends an electric charge to a particular ''address'' on its network, and the charge ignites the shell there. But even computer-fired fireworks are not completely automatic. In an emergency, digitally fired programs can be overridden with a regular laptop computer plugged into the main firing module. ''Say you're firing shells with a long hang time that float gently down to earth, and the wind shifts,'' Mr. Barker said. ''If there's a danger of them hitting the audience, you can click a mouse button to stop firing them. When the wind shifts again, you can always turn those shells back on again.'' After months of preparation and manufacturing, the fireworks display is over in a half-hour or less. But when audiences around the country pack up their lawn chairs and blankets tonight and head home happy, the fireworks companies will already be thinking about the future. ''We work virtually all year on the Fourth of July program we do for Macy's,'' Mr. Grucci said. By September, he added, he and his colleagues will be worrying about meeting the deadline for next year's show. How It Works"
"It was Father's Day 2001 and they were all waiting for their husbands to come home. In East Rockaway, N.Y., Mary Fahey was packing up the family's winter clothes. A few miles away, Denise Ford was reading over the boys' cards to Daddy. In Port Jefferson Station, farther east, Anne Downing was fretting over a flooded basement. The three would soon learn one anothers' names. Their husbands, all veteran firefighters, died that day when a routine fire in an Astoria hardware store erupted in an enormous blast. Brian Fahey was 46, Harry Ford was 50 and John J. Downing was 40. They were linked by a disaster that made headlines as far as Los Angeles and Edmonton, Canada. Thousands of firefighters from across the country traveled to mourn men they had never met. A Wall Street tycoon offered to pay for college for the children left behind. But that was of course before Sept. 11, when 343 firefighters were killed. Suddenly, after just a few months of being widows themselves, they were being treated like veterans, by a veritible army of women suffering an even more recent loss. They tried to muster the best advice, but generally answered widows' questions with a hug. They wanted to be strong, they said, but were often caught up in their own emptiness. Firefighter funerals only reminded them of their loss. Sept. 11, they said, unraveled what little strength they had built up. Mrs. Fahey and Mrs. Ford, feeling a duty as the wives of firefighters, attended countless wakes, while Mrs. Downing went once and never again. ''I was so empty with my own stuff, I just had no feelings,'' Mrs. Downing said, as if to apologize. Their children, they said, felt the losses of Sept. 11 just as directly. After the fire last Father's Day, Durrell Pearsall, who had worked with Firefighters Fahey and Ford at Rescue Company 4 in Woodside, Queens, tried to fill some of the empty space they had left behind. He began taking their five boys -- Gerard and Harry Ford, 11 and 13; Brendan Fahey, 9; and James and Patrick Fahey, both 4 -- swimming and to Jets' games. The boys looked up to Firefighter Pearsall, who at 6 feet 2 and 285 pounds was better known as Bronco. Then Firefighter Pearsall died at the World Trade Center, but the boys refused to believe it -- Bronco was tough, they told their mothers, he could dig himself out of the rubble. Mrs. Ford eventually called Rescue Company 4 and had the other firefighters talk with her son, Harry. Only then did he begin to accept Mr. Pearsall's death. ''They got connected to him,'' Mrs. Fahey recalled last week, sitting at the dining-room table in the Fords' house in Long Beach, N.Y. ''And now all of a sudden, three short months later, you're telling them, 'Well, now, the next guy that you trusted is gone.' '' The women said that on Sept. 11 they felt themselves regress, too, almost back to the hour when they learned their husbands were dead. They could not relate to anyone, they said, besides one another. In a way, they still feel like that. ''I mean, what do you say to people?'' Mrs. Ford said. ''We feel comfortable just amongst ourselves because it's easy to talk.'' '' ---- because you know that person knows exactly how you feel,'' Mrs. Fahey added, completing the thought. In a way, because their loss is three months older, the grief of the three women provides a glimpse of what lies ahead for the wives of the firefighters who died at the World Trade Center. The raw shock of loss has eased somewhat but resolution remains elusive. After feeling as if they might never get out of bed, the three widows said, they have begun to find meaning in small things. All three of their husbands called around 1 p.m., just hours before they were killed. At first the women thought it was a little odd, because their husbands typically phoned just once, in the morning. But in hindsight, the women said, they believed it was by design, so the children could wish them a final happy Father's Day. Mrs. Ford, blushing, says she thinks her husband communicates with her through pennies. She finds them everywhere, solitary copper-colored pennies. She knows she might sound crazy, but the signs have appeared when she needed them most, she said, like during a service in December. ''I was going, 'Harry, I know you are here,' '' she recalled. ''I said, 'Please, I just want to know that you're here. I just want to know.' '' Moments later, when a woman pulled at her coat and knocked over a purse, Mrs. Ford got her answer. ''It fell over and out slid a penny. Nothing else,'' she said. ''The two of us looked and I knew it. I knew Harry was there with us.'' The three women grab at whatever they can, Mrs. Ford said, explaining why she did not wash her bed sheets for three months. The smell of her husband in the cotton fibers reassured her. Mrs. Fahey figures she has opened her husband's closet door three dozen times, only to close it again, untouched, just as he left it. Mrs. Downing pores through the shaving bag that Mr. Downing left at his firehouse, Ladder Company 163 in Sunnyside, Queens, and fingers the family photos he had posted inside his locker. She has done this many times. It is simply easier to reside in the past, the women said, then to consider a future that does not include Brian Fahey, Harry Ford or John J. Downing. The instant they start to plan, or let themselves dream of their childrens' weddings, they are punched by the realization that their husbands will not be there. They say they feel cheated. ''I remember he's not going to be there and then I have to click off and just think about the next two minutes,'' Mrs. Fahey said. They all fuss over their children, and watch as they grow up in their husbands' absence. Harry, Mrs. Ford's older son, has become more protective. Brendan, Mrs. Fahey's oldest, avoids all talk of his father, while Michael, Mrs. Downing's son, talks to his father's pictures on the wall. In recent weeks, the women said, their children have grown more restless. Even the youngest among them, 4-year-olds Patrick and James Fahey, knew something important was coming; they had to make Father's Day gifts in school. The families attended a ceremony on Friday honoring Firefighters Fahey and Ford, and they will attend one for Firefighter Downing tomorrow. Today, the families plan to visit the graves and leave behind mementos. Two cigars and a teddy bear for Mr. Ford. A nice bouquet of flowers for Mr. Downing. The cards made in school for Mr. Fahey. Then tomorrow the women begin the second year without their husbands, which they have been told is worse than the first. ''It's when reality sets in,'' Mrs. Fahey said."
"The day after two workers were severely burned in an explosion on the campus of the Pfizer Corporation here, neighbors were told that another explosion was looming and asked to evacuate their homes, and the plant was closed. By late afternoon, hazardous material crews had safely vented most of the combustible chemicals in warehouse drums, and Mayor Dennis L. Popp said the evacuation was over, but the cause of the initial explosion was still under investigation. A 250-pound drum of borane tetrahydrofuran, a solution used to make chemicals and medications, exploded on Tuesday, demolishing a warehouse and injuring five employees of Pfizer, the international pharmaceutical manufacturer. After the explosion, Pfizer said the residential neighborhood was safe. But before dawn today temperature readings on four remaining warehouse drums spiked, said Betsy Raymond, a Pfizer spokeswoman. Readings from a pressure gauge indicated that the drums were potentially explosive. After dawn, state and local police officers knocked on the doors of about 120 houses surrounding the research and development portion of Pfizer. The officers said that a voluntary evacuation plan was in effect in the neighborhood. ''The state police officer told me that he couldn't kick me out since it was my house, but he would like me to evacuate for my own safety,'' said Zene Gergen, 66, a retired New London schoolteacher who lives on Greenway Road, a football field's length from the warehouse. Pfizer provided transportation to Groton City Hall for those who chose it. A Groton patrolman, Dale Grenstiner, said the families were cooperative and most of them simply went to work for the day. Mr. Gergen and about 30 others registered for shelter with the American Red Cross at City Hall, but fewer than 10 stayed for more than a brief time, choosing to go shopping or to go to the beach. About an hour before the mayor's announcement that the evacuation was over, Libby Lloyd, 72, walked back and forth between a television set and the Red Cross table at City Hall. ''I'm here because I don't want to get blown up,'' she said, adding that she had packed her pajamas just in case. The two most seriously injured workers remained in critical condition in the Bridgeport Hospital burn center, a hospital spokesman said today."
"Five people were hurt, two of them seriously, when a chemical solvent exploded in a storage warehouse on the campus of Pfizer, the international pharmaceutical manufacturer. The police said that ''a very impressive explosion'' occurred around 8 a.m., followed by a fire. The warehouse and surrounding buildings were evacuated and roads to the 112-acre campus were blocked for three hours while the fire was extinguished. Two men with burns covering more than 50 percent of their bodies were airlifted to the Bridgeport Hospital Burn Center. The men, who are listed in critical condition, were exposed to flames and splattering chemicals, said John Cappiello, a spokesman for Bridgeport Hospital. ''The trauma team is optimistic they will pull through,'' Mr. Cappiello said. ''Their injuries do not appear to be life-threatening at this point, but they will be monitored closely for the next 24 to 48 hours.'' Two other people were treated for injuries at Pfizer's on-site medical center and released; another person sought treatment at a local hospital, said Stephen Lederer, a Pfizer spokesman. Neither Pfizer nor the hospital would identify the victims. The warehouse, 50 feet by 100 feet, was made of concrete on steel frames; its sheet-metal roof was mangled and blown off. Onlookers described the building after the explosion as ''an upside-down umbrella.'' The warehouse is part of Pfizer's research and development sector, Mr. Lederer said; about 4,500 people are employed there. The warehouse, in a web of residential streets, is about 100 yards from the nearest house. The police said that there was no danger to the residential area but that the noise alarmed people who live nearby. ''I was in my bedroom and heard a real loud, loud noise,'' said Lori Packer, whose house on Shennecossett Parkway is about 200 yards from the warehouse. The house shook and some papers on the bureau fell to the floor, she said. ''My daughter started crying and my son thought it was an earthquake,'' she said. ''I heard people screaming.'' Eight hours after the explosion, details were not yet known, said John D. Cunningham, deputy chief of the City of Groton Fire Department. Mr. Lederer of Pfizer said that the warehouse had been used to store solvents, the chemical agents that dissolve other chemicals. All chemicals are being removed in compliance with state and federal environmental laws."
"The Federal Aviation Administration said today that it had developed a simple lightweight system for preventing fuel tank explosions like the one that destroyed T.W.A. Flight 800 in 1996. The system uses a combination of equipment already on the aircraft and parts that are in common use in the chemical industry. Since it became clear in late 1996 that the cause of the Flight 800 disaster was a center fuel tank explosion, safety experts have made tank improvements a top priority. Some flaws that could introduce a spark have been addressed on Boeing 747's, like Flight 800, and in other models, notably Boeing 737's. But there has been no overall solution to the problem of the potentially explosive mix of fuel and air in near-empty tanks. The new system, installed on an old 747 at the aviation agency's Technical Center at Atlantic City Airport here, separates air into oxygen and nitrogen, and pumps the nitrogen into the air space in the tanks, to assure an inert condition that could not support fire or explosion even if fuel and a spark were present. ''This is a major milestone for us,'' Nicholas Sabatini, the agency's associate administrator for regulation and certification, said. Some industry experts were more cautious, noting that the agency had no estimate of what the system would cost. But Boeing hopes to fly the system for testing next year. The fumes in the almost-empty center tank on Flight 800 exploded. Safety investigators later determined that the mixture of air and fuel in such tanks is frequently capable of supporting combustion. The spark's source was never found. Officials said today that if oxygen could be excluded from the tanks, some potential sources of ignition would be irrelevant. At one point the agency focused on changing the fuel so it is harder to ignite, and later on ''inerting'' the tanks by pumping nitrogen into them while planes are on the ground. It backed away from both ideas when the industries involved said they would be too expensive. But on-board ''inerting'' shows some promise, experts say. Boeing recently applied for permission to install such a system on planes it builds. A Boeing spokeswoman, Liz Verdier, said, ''There are a lot of hurdles.'' Among the problems, Ms. Verdier said, is that the agency has not stated in any detail what requirements such a system would have to meet. And it would have to be ''reliable, maintainable and practical,'' she said. The agency's device has evident attractions; it weighs only 160 pounds and has hardly any moving parts. At the National Transportation Safety Board, Carol Carmody, the acting chairwoman, said, ''We are most encouraged that the F.A.A. had taken this on and made such progress.'' She said that in December 1996, five months after the T.W.A. accident, the board recommended to the agency that it consider ''inerting'' but that three and a half years later the agency said it would be too expensive. In the last few months, however, the agency has made two revisions that led to its change of heart. The first was to relax the goal for reducing oxygen in the air space in the tank. At first, the agency convened an industry committee to work on the problem and told the committee that the amount of oxygen should be reduced to 10 percent. (Ordinary air has about 21 percent oxygen and about 78 percent nitrogen.) This year the agency decided that it could permit 12 percent oxygen and still eliminate most of the threat of explosion. The difference seems small, but a system that will achieve 12 percent is far smaller and lighter than a system that must achieve 10 percent, experts say. The second change was in making use of on-board equipment, specifically compressed air ducts. The engines on big jets compress air to use in the engine itself, but the planes bleed off some of that to pressurize the cabin. The agency's system takes some of that compressed air to power the system that makes nitrogen. The heart of the system is a three-foot cylinder filled with a polymer membrane that allows oxygen to pass through more readily than nitrogen. The oxygen is allowed out through vents on the side of the cylinder and is dumped overboard; the nitrogen comes out the base and is routed to the fuel tank. The system produces nitrogen of varying purity, depending on how much gas it is called upon to produce. In cruise flight, it can produce a mixture that is 99 percent nitrogen, and can gradually raise the nitrogen level in the tanks very high. As the plane descends into denser air, the tank has a tendency to ''inhale,'' and the system must put out more gas to prevent the empty space in the tank from filling with regular air; at that point, the system puts out a mixture that is only 88 percent nitrogen. But that is high enough to keep the tank inert on landing, and it is still inert on the next takeoff, said Ivor Thomas, the aviation agency's chief scientific and technical adviser for fuel systems. Agency officials said that military planes carry inerting systems that can push the oxygen content down to 8 percent or 10 percent but that these weigh thousands of pounds. A reason for stricter limits in military planes is that they may face much higher-energy sources of ignition; rather than stray sparks from frayed wires, they may face enemy fire."
"An explosion at a condominium complex rocked this shoreline city early today, killing two residents and injuring several. Late tonight, state and city fire and police officials had not determined the cause of the blast -- which many residents initially mistook for an earthquake or a terrorist attack -- but were investigating rumors that neighbors had smelled natural gas late Monday night. The enormous blast belched a towering globe of fire high over this city of 52,000 just west of New Haven, leveling one of the complex's three-unit, two-story buildings, destroying nearby cars and blowing out doors and windows of several neighboring buildings, police officials said. ''Cars were just demolished,'' said Officer Domenic F. Vinci of the West Haven Police, who arrived at the Orchard Hill complex minutes after the explosion, which occurred at 3:25 a.m. ''A really nice, big steel door was just crumpled in half. Fiberglass insulation was in the trees. The whole town shook.'' West Haven's mayor, H. Richard Borer Jr., said he was at his office, looking up directions to a golf course where he had planned to play today, when the blast occurred. ''It shook City Hall,'' he said, ''and it's miles and miles away.'' All three of the city's fire districts responded to the ensuing fire, Mayor Borer said. Rescue workers found the charred remains of Vivian Tindell, 47, and Conrad Palmer, 70, in the crater created by the explosion in the hilltop complex's northwest corner, the police said. Mrs. Tindell's husband, Foster Tindell, 52, ''got blown out of the house,'' landed in a nearby street and, incredibly, survived, Officer Vinci said. Mr. Tindell suffered head injuries and was rushed to Yale-New Haven Hospital, where he was in fair condition this afternoon, a hospital spokeswoman said. Four other Orchard Hill residents -- a woman who is five months pregnant, two children and a man -- were also hospitalized. The two children were released in the morning after being treated for shock. The man and the pregnant woman, whose names were not released, were discharged in the afternoon, Mayor Borer said. The West Haven fire chief, William Johnson, said he could hardly believe that more people had not perished, given the extreme force of the blast. All 46 units of the complex have been evacuated and will not be reoccupied until the cause of the explosion is determined, he said. Inspectors from the state fire marshal's office and the Department of Public Utility Control were also investigating the explosion. Southern Connecticut Gas shut down service to the complex shortly after 3:50 a.m., when Fire Department officials called to report the blast, a company spokeswoman said. About 75 evacuated residents were taken to a nearby middle school cafeteria for food and clothing and to make temporary living arrangements with the Red Cross, which was organizing emergency services. With giant fans whirring overhead, weary residents sat stunned in today's swampy 90-degree weather, counting their blessings. ''We came outside and saw the huge fireball,'' said Doreen Chaney, who lives with her 4-year-old daughter, Nikki, in a building adjacent to the one destroyed. ''Everybody was running around in their underwear, yelling,'' she said. ''It was just devastating.'' Ramona Young, 28, said she found herself running dazed and naked through the Orchard Hill complex with her two children, ages 2 and 11, immediately after the blast. ''I thought it was a terrorist attack; my girlfriend thought it was an earthquake,'' she said. ''I just wanted to get out of there.'' Ms. Young and other residents said they had heard other neighbors complain about a gas odor around 11 p.m. Monday. But a spokeswoman for Southern Connecticut Gas said today that no complaints had been received. ''We try to make people aware of what to do if they do smell gas,'' said the spokeswoman, Romilda Anderson. ''We tell them to leave the residence, don't use the phone from that residence, don't even switch a light on.''"
"A huge explosion killed at least 21 people today near a road construction warehouse here, and investigators said that although its cause was unclear, they were treating it as a terror attack because the site was near a major hydroelectric dam. The explosion spattered bricks and stone for hundreds of yards, killing people in nearby houses and in a bus more than 50 yards away. Brick buildings were partly collapsed, and a metal warehouse was reduced to its skeletal frame. Two craters remained -- one at least 20 feet across -- and at least 85 people were injured, the police said. One official said people as far as 400 yards away had been killed. ''I have never heard such a bang in my life,'' said Ashiq Nabi, a local army commander who helped gather the dead, several of them women and children. There was no definitive report tonight on exactly what had happened. One high-ranking local official was quoted in news reports as saying that the road construction company stored explosives in the building, and that it could have blown up accidentally. But an army investigator, Maj. Abdul Qauam Azimi, said he believed that the explosives had been stored at the warehouse for a terror attack on the nearby Darunta hydroelectric dam, which provides power for this city in eastern Afghanistan. As it was, the explosion occurred only a few hundred yards from the dam and reportedly damaged its electrical works. In recent weeks, Major Azimi said, intelligence reports of an imminent attack caused tighter security around the dam. He said he believed that explosives meant for the dam went off today by accident. ''It's an act of terror,'' he said. Major Azimi said four members of the construction company, a private aid organization called the Afghan Construction and Logistics Unit, were arrested today. Although the major said fuses, mines and rocket shells loaded with explosive material had been uncovered at the site, he would not release further details of the investigation. Jalalabad, some 70 miles east of the capital, Kabul, sits near the border with Pakistan, in a remote and unsettled area where fighters from Al Qaeda and the Taliban who escaped American forces are believed to be hiding. Not far to the northeast, American forces on patrol have been fired on twice in recent days. On July 6, Hajji Abdul Qadir, a vice president of Afghanistan and the governor of Nangarhar Province, who lived here, was assassinated in Kabul, and Jalalabad residents have staged protests demanding the arrest of his killers. In April a bomb exploded here near the convoy of Gen. Muhammad Fahim, the Afghan defense minister. Five people died in that attack. The explosion today -- on the Muslim day of prayer -- occurred at 12:30 p.m. The company's offices are believed to have been unoccupied except for four security guards, one of whom the police said had been killed. Another, Muhammad Alam, 27, said he had been eating his lunch when the blast went off. ''It was kind of like an earthquake,'' he said tonight, lying in a hospital bed with head and lower back wounds. ''It was very loud, and it threw me very far.'' He said that he did not know of any explosives stored at the compound and that he had seen no one there today but his fellow guards. ''I can't think what it might have been,'' he said. Mr. Nabi, the army commander, said he had been posted not far down the road when the blast occurred. He described a scene of carnage, with bodies and body parts scattered amid rubble and bits of twisted metal. He said he had collected 13 bodies. Officials here said the company was run by Afghans and did road construction and other building projects. The Associated Press reported tonight that it had been founded with the help of American government funds, but that the United States withdrew its support about a decade ago. The news agency also reported that the group's founder, known as Engineer Karim, had been jailed during the Taliban government for refusing to place a Taliban representative on its board. An investigator here said Engineer Karim was currently in Peshawar, Pakistan, just over the border. Damage from the blast was also reported at Jalalabad University, which is nearby. Several university students were injured, among them Abdul Rahman, 25, who lay in a hospital tonight with his head bandaged. His cousin, Asadullah Hamdani, said Mr. Abdul Rahman had been hit by debris while walking past the site. Mr. Hamdani said he could not imagine the construction company's being involved in a terror strike. ''This was not an accident related to terror,'' he said. ''It was a charitable group. It was helping the people.''"
"Raising fears of a resurgence of Islamic militancy, a bomb attack on a Christian hospital here this morning killed 3 Pakistani nurses and wounded 23 people as they left a chapel after prayer services. After the attack, the second on a Christian target this week, Western diplomats and Pakistani officials voiced concerns that Islamic militant groups might be mounting a new challenge to one of the United States' most important allies in the war on terrorism, President Pervez Musharraf. Witnesses and officials said there had been three assailants, one who held the hospital's lone guard at bay while two others hurled powerful homemade explosives at dozens of nurses. The attack came just four days after six Pakistanis were killed when masked gunmen attacked a Christian missionary school 40 miles from here. Both attacks were carried out in towns close to the capital, Islamabad, in areas thought to be firmly under government control. In the more volatile western city of Quetta, near the border with southern Afghanistan, unidentified gunmen shot and critically wounded a Pakistani general today. Pakistani experts warn that the country may be entering a period of repeated terrorist attacks by a broad array of militant groups enraged by President Musharraf's decision to align himself with the United States after the Sept. 11 attacks. ''These militants are fighting back, and I think it will continue for many months,'' said Tariq Rahman, a linguistics professor at Quaid-e-Azam University who has studied the groups. ''They are calling the bluff of the government.'' A Western diplomat predicted: ''You will have more and more of these kinds of attacks. It's open season against not only foreigners and Christians but also Musharraf.'' No group had claimed responsibility for the attack by tonight. Pakistan's minister for information, Nisar Memon, said today's killings were ''a sinister attempt to drive a wedge between the Muslim and Christian communities of Pakistan.'' About 97 percent of the 140 million Pakistanis are Muslim; less than 2 percent are Christian. Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who leads one of the two important opposition parties but is banned from taking part in October elections, claimed that the military leadership was losing its grip. ''It claims to be a strong, one-man show, whereas the reality is that the situation is slipping out of hand,'' she said in a statement from London, where she lives in exile rather than face charges of widespread corruption during her two terms in office. The October elections are supposed to create a democratic legislature and government to counterbalance General Musharraf, who is becoming increasingly unpopular. Pakistanis generally welcomed his rise to power in a coup in October 1999 after a series of corrupt civilian governments. But his heavy-handed methods, particularly a clumsy referendum last spring to prolong his rule, have cost him support among pro-Western Pakistanis, while anti-Western militants have detested his alignment with the United States. Pakistani officials were reluctant to speculate on who might have carried out this week's attacks. But diplomats say some small militant groups may be spontaneously conducting separate strikes, while others may be working on larger operations with help from the remnants of Osama bin Laden's Qaeda guerrillas, who are thought to have fled from Afghanistan to Pakistan as Taliban rule collapsed. The attacks, coordinated or not, come at a sensitive time for Pakistan and the region. Attacks in Kashmir that brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war this spring are also on the rise again as Pakistani militants vow to disrupt Kashmir elections scheduled for September and October. In Afghanistan, the interim government selected in June is still struggling to extend its authority beyond Kabul. Western diplomats and Pakistani experts say the latest attacks may be a last desperate effort by militants slowly losing their bases of support in the region. After General Musharraf announced a crackdown on militant organizations in January, members of various groups formed a loose coalition that vowed to topple the military government. Named Lashkar-e-Omar, or Omar's Army, the coalition draws its name from Ahmed Omar Sheikh, the militant leader convicted of masterminding the kidnapping and murder of the American journalist Daniel Pearl in Karachi. The attack on the Taxila Christian hospital today laid out a scenario that observers fear could be repeated over and over in Pakistan. ''How do you stop something like this?'' an ashen-faced Western diplomat said today as he stood among pools of blood and shattered glass. Previously, militants had selected targets like the American consulate in the restive southern city of Karachi, where an explosion killed 12 Pakistanis in June and 11 French contractors died in a suicide bombing in May. On July 13, a grenade thrown at foreign tourists following the ancient Silk Road in Mansehra in northern Pakistan wounded nine Europeans. But this week's attacks have hit institutions associated with Christianity and foreign missionaries. Only Pakistanis have been killed, but diplomats said they were apparently attacked for their association with these Western, Christian institutions. At 7:30 a.m., witnesses said, roughly 100 doctors, nurses and administrators gathered in a small stone chapel for their morning prayer services. Thirty yards away, the first visitors began filing through the main gate. A lone unarmed guard stood watch. At roughly 7:45 a.m., according to the police and witnesses, two men entered the compound carrying bags and walked toward the hospital's administrative building. Eric Khursheed, the unarmed security guard, shouted at the two men to come back to the gate. A third man suddenly walked up to Mr. Khursheed, pulled a pistol and ordered him to go inside a nearby guardhouse. The two men walked past a sign that read ''the chapel is open for prayers at all times,'' opened a small blue metal gate and headed down a narrow brick path toward the church, witnesses said. Dozens of women clad in white nursing uniforms began to file out of the church in the drizzling rain. Some carried umbrellas. Others had white nurse's hats pinned to their hair. The men hurled two powerful explosives at the women and ran. Alishma Masih, a nurse and mother of two, was one of the first to die. Naziran Masih and Bushra Masih were also mortally wounded. (The three women shared the last name of many local Christians, which means ''Jesus.'') The detonations were so powerful that they carved two-foot-deep craters in the brick walkway. Windows in stores across the street were shattered. The twisted silver metal spokes of an umbrella landed in a tree branch 10 feet away. After hurling the bombs, the two attackers ran out the main gate, but one of them collapsed. A small piece of shrapnel had pierced his back and apparently killed him, doctors said. Mr. Khursheed, the security guard, said the man with the pistol escaped. He said that based on his accent, the man appeared to be a Pakistani, but not from the area. Throughout the morning, local Muslims, who make up the vast majority of the hospital's patients, came to console wounded Christians. ''These people cure the Muslims,'' Manafia Begum, a local Muslim, said as she held the hand of one wounded nurse. ''And look what happens.''"
"Measured against the estimated 1.5 million casualties Afghanistan has suffered in 23 years of conflict, three explosions today in the Kabul area had a limited impact: A blast outside the old Soviet Embassy killed one Afghan and injured three, while two land mines near the American air base at Bagram killed four Afghans, and wounded 18. But the day's toll, with a rising incidence of explosions, bombings and other attacks in recent weeks, and reports that one troublesome warlord may be reassembling his troops, heightened apprehensions that Afghanistan may be entering a new phase of conflict. Some senior Afghan officials warn that the 16,000 mainly Western troops here -- including 7,800 American soldiers and a 4,800-member international security force in Kabul -- could confront an open-ended challenge that would destabilize this country for years. The Afghan officials say that the remnants of the Taliban and Qaeda networks that were driven from power in November may be in the early stages of coalescing with other armed opposition groups. These groups, the officials say, include disaffected regional warlords who feel excluded from the new power arrangements in Kabul and fighters loyal to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a guerrilla commander who rose to prominence during the Soviet military occupation in the 1980's. After years of exile in Iran, Mr. Hekmatyar crossed back secretly into Afghanistan earlier this year, and immediately set about trying to resurrect his old guerrilla network, the officials say. As an ethnic Pashtun, he has ties to the predominantly Pashtun Taliban. Afghan officials say he has been moving among Pashtun tribesmen in eastern Afghanistan making the case that the Kabul government, dominated by ethnic Tajiks and sustained by American military power, is a ripe target for a new holy war. So far, the attacks in Kabul and southern cities including Kandahar, and on American military outposts have been sporadic, limited in impact and often amateurishly bungled. In almost every case, the perpetrators have escaped, leaving few traces. But taken together, the attacks have sent an unmistakable signal that there are pockets of determined resistance to the post-Taliban order and that rooting them out is not going to be easy. The explosion today in Kabul seemed to be the work of an armed underground movement that has been registering its presence in the capital with increasing frequency in recent weeks. An explosive device hidden in a wooden handcart detonated as a motorized patrol of British soldiers was passing. An Afghan man on a bicycle was killed, and two other Afghans were wounded. The only British casualty was a soldier with a lightly wounded wrist. The other episode was murkier. An ambulance that went to pick up the body of an Afghan man who was killed by an explosion while working for a Danish land-mine-clearing organization struck an antitank mine as it passed through a crowded bazaar near the Bagram base, 40 miles north of Kabul. Three Afghans in the ambulance were killed; the injured included bystanders and about a dozen mine-clearance workers. American spokesmen at Bagram declined to say immediately whether the explosion was being treated as an accident or an attack. But Noor ul-Haq, an Afghan who is deputy director of the Afghan Mine Clearance Planning Agency, several of whose workers were injured, was quoted by Reuters as saying that he suspected the second mine had been deliberately planted, because it detonated on a road frequently used by mine-clearing groups. Some of the recent explosions that were originally described as terrorist attacks have since been confirmed as accidents. But other attacks clearly were not. In early July, a vice president in the Kabul government, Hajji Abdul Qadir, was assassinated in Kabul. Three weeks later, Afghan security forces intercepted a car packed with explosives near the presidential palace and arrested a man of Central Asian origin who officials said admitted plotting to kill President Hamid Karzai and other officials. Several other bombs have exploded or been defused in Kabul, Jalalabad and Kandahar. Several remote American military bases in the Pashtun-dominated eastern and southern provinces being used in the hunt for the Taliban and Al Qaeda have also come under rocket and small-arms attacks. Within the Kabul government, there are differing views of the attacks. Some officials recall that the Soviet forces who invaded Afghanistan in December 1979 faced a similar pattern of poorly coordinated and clumsily executed attacks, but they note that it was not long before Moscow faced a formidable guerrilla movement. Others say the analogy is flawed because Soviet forces came here to support an unpopular government, while the American troops came here on a wave of popular enthusiasm to oust the widely hated Taliban. In addition, these officials say, the guerrillas who fought Soviet forces had wide international support, while the Taliban, Al Qaeda and any new allies in the Afghan hinterland have little or no prospect of outside backing. Still, anxiety at high levels of the Karzai government has been such that officials have been pressing American military commanders to widen their focus beyond the Taliban and Al Qaeda to include threats from groups like Mr. Hekmatyar's. Last week, Abdullah, the Afghan foreign minister, appealed to senior Pakistani officials in Islamabad to halt what the Afghans contend has been a new pattern of support for Mr. Hekmatyar from Pakistan's military intelligence organization, Inter-Services Intelligence. The Pakistani agency developed close ties with Mr. Hekmatyar during the years when it was funneling substantial American military and financial aid to Mr. Hekmatyar's guerrilla group. Afghan officials said the Pakistani officials listened to the appeals without confirming or denying that there had been fresh contacts with Mr. Hekmatyar."
"A car crashed into an exposed natural gas pipe here early today, rupturing the pipe and prompting a frantic evacuation of nearby houses and apartments that was completed only moments before a thunderous explosion. Five people were injured, a three-story brick apartment building was demolished and about 75 people were left homeless. As leaking gas hissed from the broken main into the frigid night air, police officers and firefighters hurried door to door through six two-story homes and three-story apartment buildings, rousing sleeping residents and ordering them to leave. The evacuation took about 40 minutes, ending minutes before the building blew up with a deep roar and a flash of fire and bright white light, witnesses said. Chunks of brick and other debris whizzing through the air struck and injured three firefighters and two repairmen who had just shut off a valve on the broken pipe about 3:45 a.m., stopping the leak, officials said. The force of the blast knocked some rescue workers to the ground and shattered windows in storefronts and other buildings up to three blocks from the explosion, at New Brunswick and East Avenues in a mixed residential and commercial area downtown. The evacuation -- and some good fortune -- was credited with preventing more injuries and, possibly, deaths. ''The policemen and firemen were trying to rush everybody out because they knew something was going to happen,'' said Wil Diaz, a regional supervisor with the Red Cross. ''It's a miracle nobody was killed.'' Mayor Joseph Vas said members of the evacuation team risked their lives to save residents. ''My highest praise goes to our Police and Fire Departments,'' he said. Tricia Smith, who lives across East Avenue from the building that was destroyed, said she was preparing a snack of macaroni and cheese when the car crashed shortly before 3 a.m. ''My whole building vibrated,'' she said. ''I ran outside and just heard a loud hissing. I didn't know what it was, then I started choking and my eyes started burning. I ran back upstairs, called 911, and started screaming, 'Everybody out, everybody out!' '' Fahed Qureshi, 25, said he was watching television in a friend's second-floor apartment when he heard pounding on the door and the order to leave. He said he hurried outside. ''You could hear the gas leaking, like air was coming out of someplace with too much pressure,'' he said. Most of the evacuees were taken by ambulances and buses to an emergency shelter about a mile from the blast site. Fifteen people had lived in the building that was destroyed, 240 New Brunswick, and they lost all their possessions, officials said. About 60 more lived in the five other buildings that were evacuated. They will not be permitted to return until city engineers determine that the buildings are structurally sound, officials said. The driver of the car that hit the pipe, Jovanna Chahua, 22, of North Plainfield, told the police that her vehicle lost all power as she turned from New Brunswick Avenue onto East Avenue and that she was unable to steer or stop it, officials said. Ms. Chahua, who was unhurt, was charged with reckless driving. An exterior pipe system is commonly used at commercial and large residential buildings in older cities and strip malls in the Northeast, said Chris Reardon, a spokesman for the Elizabethtown Gas Company, which owns the pipe. Typically in such systems, an exposed pipe two inches in diameter is attached to a buried feeder line and stretches vertically about three feet above the ground into a meter and a device that reduces gas pressure. From that equipment, a horizontal pipe carries gas into a building's interior piping. The first floor of the building that blew up was occupied by a Laundromat with gas-powered dryers, officials said."
"For a few harrowing moments yesterday, Frank Conti thought he would have to run for his life again. Mr. Conti, who escaped from the 81st floor of the World Trade Center after the Sept. 11 attack, was walking out the front door of his Staten Island home when a thunderous boom sounded and a shock wave hit him in the belly, followed by a whoosh of rushing air. By the time he stumbled into the street, a wall of black smoke was already blotting out the western horizon. ''My first thought was terrorism,'' said Mr. Conti, 37, who also survived the 1993 terrorist bombing of the twin towers. ''These days, I'm so edgy, I always think the worst.'' So, too, did most of his neighbors at Sharrotts Crossing, a blue-collar subdivision just a mile from Port Mobil, the Staten Island fuel depot that turned into a spectacular inferno yesterday. The explosion of a barge at the depot shattered windows on the southern tip of Staten Island and on the New Jersey side of the Arthur Kill. It knocked family photos off walls, disrupted phone service and sent thousands of panicked residents into the streets. After the blast, quarter-sized chips of burnt material rained down on roofs and patios. In those first chaotic minutes, officials in Woodbridge Township, N.J., evacuated hundreds of students from schools. On Staten Island, one resident, Allan Kilimnik, said his sofa shook so violently he thought a plane had crashed into his block. Maureen Beahan suspected a massive pile-up on the West Shore Expressway, which skirts the neighborhood. And Carol Weinberg was convinced terrorists had destroyed the Outerbridge Crossing, a four-lane bridge that links the island to New Jersey. ''They've finally done it,'' she said to herself. ''It was so terrifying, I didn't know what to do.'' Two hours after the blast, her dachshund, Nathan, was still quivering in her arms. ''For an hour he was hiding under the bed,'' said Ms. Weinberg, a 43-year-old physical fitness instructor. ''I guess he's worse off than I am.'' In an era of orange alerts and jangled nerves, few said they had suspected an industrial accident. Richard Grossman said his first thought was that terrorists had begun a chemical attack on his neighborhood. He grabbed a ventilator mask given to him by a friend, but realized he had no way to protect his younger brother and sister. ''It made me think I should have bought that duct tape and plastic,'' Mr. Grossman said. Some of the worst damage from the explosion occurred across the kill in the Sewaren section of Woodbridge, a waterfront neighborhood of elegant Victorians and Tudors that has long since been enveloped by tank farms and oil refineries. Fran Gadomski, 60, was at her kitchen table when the barge ignited, shattering the glass in her French doors. Pictures tumbled to the floor, ashes blew down her chimney, and cracks, she later discovered, snaked up the stucco walls of her home. ''I thought the house was blowing up,'' she said, glancing at flames that still lapped within view of her living room. '' 'Oh no, they bombed.' That's your first thought.'' Ms. Gadomski said she was all set to flee to the family beach house, part of her family's emergency plan, when her husband called to say the fire was accidental. Although intense, the panic and fear, for most people, was short-lived. By the time the screaming sirens began filling Sharrotts Road, most everyone, it seems, had learned about the cause of the explosion from radio or television. But as the smoke and hysteria began to subside, a different kind of excitement took hold as reporters, news trucks and a panoply of emergency workers began to clog the neighborhood. The mayor and the police and fire commissioners also made cameo appearances. By early afternoon, the streets had taken on a carnival atmosphere. Mr. Kilimnik, 43, an advertising salesman, worked the news crews, trying to sell some videotape he took from his bedroom window, while Tori Zarra, 10, eagerly recounted to reporters how the blast had knocked her parakeets off their perch. With the ventilator still around his neck, Mr. Grossman was pulled aside by a TV reporter. ''Do I look O.K.?'' he asked. ''I feel like Ben Affleck.'' THE BARGE BLAST: JITTERS"
"At 10:10 yesterday morning, when an explosion shook Staten Island and sent a tower of smoke skyward, a series of events was set into motion around New York City that had little to do with fighting a raging shoreline fire. Was it a terrorist attack, city emergency officials wanted to know. And more important, was it of a type they have worried about since Sept. 11, 2001: a diversionary explosion meant to limit the resources able to respond to a more deadly attack to follow elsewhere? ''There was great concern,'' a senior City Hall official said. So much, in fact, that in the minutes after the explosion, the Police Department initiated a plan to secure vulnerable parts of the city. These include other fuel refineries and storage areas, landmarks, bridges, tunnels and other areas the police refer to as sensitive locations, like synagogues, hotels and other normally unguarded places. The Fire Department, after sounding a second alarm, broadcast a 10-60 code, which designated the explosion a major emergency; at one point, it dispatched four of the city's five elite rescue companies, at least two of the department's seven special squads, and the hazardous materials team. In addition, officials said, members of a special National Guard Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team, which is based in upstate New York but which came to the city two weeks ago in response to the national terrorism alert, went to the scene to test for chemical, biological and radiological agents. ''The people who study this and plan for this, whether there is specific intelligence as to how it would come down, that's one of the notions: that there will be a series of events,'' one official said. The immediate presumption of terrorism was, of course, far from limited to the emergency response. From the first clap of the explosion to the first television pictures of rising smoke, fears of an attack fanned quickly from Staten Island throughout the city. ''I just assumed it was terrorism from the start, I've got to be honest,'' said Shaun Sullivan, 22, a plumber who lives more than two miles from the explosion and woke to see his bedroom shaking. Those fears resonated even on Wall Street, where the price of crude oil and heating oil briefly surged more than a dollar on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Traders worried that heating oil shipments could have been disrupted at a time when stockpiles were low and the weather severe. Police officials said yesterday that the response to the explosion was an encouraging demonstration of how emergency resources should be deployed in a terrorism situation. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, for example, said that under an order written early last year to ensure that police resources were not drawn in and overcome by any diversionary action, the department's response to the scene was limited. But large numbers of officers were dispatched to dozens of sites -- Mr. Kelly would not name them -- that counterterrorism specialists consider particularly vulnerable. In fact, the Police Department has focused on such situations in exercises it has conducted with the Naval War College in Rhode Island, where an escalating series of events, presumably intended to draw away resources and confuse officials, is thrown at police, fire and emergency officials to help hone their skills. At City Hall yesterday, concern about the explosion being diversionary remained high until a second major emergency failed to materialize quickly, city officials said. Those fears faded into some measure of relief by 10:45 a.m., when the police began to determine that the blast was probably accidental. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who was in the middle of his weekly radio program, then made his way to Staten Island. Fire officials said yesterday that the department had committed more than 210 firefighters from more than 45 companies to fight the fire, including most of its highly trained units specializing in hazardous materials. Police officials said about 200 city police officers responded, as well as officers from New Jersey. According to a department spokesman, Michael Loughran, a chief who arrived early at the fire scene transmitted a second alarm for more firefighting units. At the same time, the chief sent out the 10-60 code, used for major disasters, like plane crashes and building collapses, that can have large numbers of victims. One fire official not at yesterday's scene, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, expressed concern that the department might have overreacted to the explosion, leaving itself vulnerable if a major event had happened elsewhere. ''They sent it in as a major emergency,'' the official said. When any major fire occurs in the city, the department's standard procedure is to relocate units from other neighborhoods to the quarters of engine and ladder companies that are busy fighting the fire. But while the city's 346 engines and ladders can be relocated more or less smoothly, it is harder to shift coverage by rescue and squad companies because there are fewer of them, and they must generally travel greater distances to respond. A Fire Department union official said he believed yesterday's response showed that the department remained vulnerable. ''In this post-9/11 world, the F.D.N.Y. needs to be prepared to fight two or more major catastrophes at the same time,'' said Stephen Cassidy, president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association, in a statement. ''And we clearly do not have the resources to do that.'' Mr. Loughran said he would not describe the Fire Department's plans for the possibility of multiple large events in the city, because of fears that this information could be used by terrorists in their planning. But he vigorously defended the department's response and capacity, saying that it was still able to perform fully around the city, even at the height of the mobilization to Staten Island. THE BARGE BLAST: SECURITY"
"The environmental and health consequences of the fire at the Port Mobil terminal are not expected to be lasting or dire, scientists and government officials said yesterday. Because the fuel that was being unloaded at the terminal was unleaded gasoline, they said, the plume contained the same mix of pollutants, for better or worse, that people breathe every day from the millions of automobiles burning the exact same stuff. Gasoline also burns fast, meaning that the plume shot up high enough to carry away most of the partly burned carbon particles, or soot, that might have posed a health hazard, officials said. A spokesman for the United States Coast Guard, which has lead authority for a cleanup on the Arthur Kill -- the waterway separating Staten Island and New Jersey -- said any gasoline not burned in the fire would evaporate quickly and was unlikely to have a lasting impact on the environment. But while the region's ecosystem may have escaped disaster, the explosion and fire have drawn new attention to the environmental record of the terminal itself, which, according to environmentalists and court documents, has been spotty. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation charged the terminal's owners last year with a long list of violations, including failure to conduct inspections and properly maintain equipment and failure to equip piping with leak-detection equipment. The company requested more details about the complaint, which is unsettled. The owner of the barge that exploded, Bouchard Transportation of Hicksville, N.Y., has also faced government sanctions. It paid $1.3 million in cleanup costs and a $75,000 civil penalty for an employee found to be legally drunk last March during an oil spill in the East River. In late 2001, the terminal's owner, ExxonMobil, admitted discharging hazardous waste without permits into two artificial ponds on the site and agreed to pay $11.2 million in penalties -- one of the largest hazardous waste settlements in United States history, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Last night, ExxonMobil said in a statement that the issues raised by the state, and the earlier consent agreement with the E.P.A., had nothing to do with safety issues or the loading of fuel. A spokesman for the Department of Environmental Conservation, Michael J. Fraser, also agreed that inspectors had found no safety concerns about fuel-loading But some environmentalists said that they would press for a closer examination of the terminal. ''There is evidence there that they have been irresponsible in the past in dealing with substances exactly like this,'' said Mhairi Dunlop, a spokeswoman for Greenpeace. For now, however, city and federal environmental regulators said, there is little for residents to worry about. A spokesman for the city's Department of Environmental Protection, Charles Sturcken, said two air monitors, which were already up and running in Staten Island, picked up nothing from the fire. The Environmental Protection Agency set up four air monitors in Staten Island and found air quality at the same levels normally expected in the regular traffic of the city. ''So far, the air results we're seeing don't cause any concern,'' Mr. Sturcken said. Investigators said another thing to bear in mind was that people breathe gasoline exhaust all the time. The issue, as always, is how much pollutant is consumed in each breath. ''It's a question of concentration -- we expect that by several miles downwind, it would be below the level of concern,'' said Nir Barnea, a certified industrial hygienist monitoring the fire for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Mobil terminal is one of the largest and busiest in the nation, handling gasoline, heating oil and other distillates for the Northeast market. And in the busiest of times, that could have led to a far more catastrophic fire. The terminal, which handles about 750 barges a year, is capable of unloading fuel from four barges simultaneously. The terminal can store up to 2.5 million barrels, or more than 100 million gallons of petroleum products, but only 500,000 barrels were stored when the barge exploded. THE BARGE BLAST: ENVIRONMENT"
"An explosion ripped through a dense city block in Lagos, Nigeria, this morning, killing at least 30 people, injuring many more, and setting off chaotic looting that impeded rescue efforts. The blast blew off the front of a four-story residential and office complex, including a bank, in a crowded and largely poor quarter of the city. Looters were seen leaving the scene with piles of cash and computer equipment, and rescue workers struggled against the crowd to pull bodies from the rubble. Baton-wielding police officers tried to beat away the looters. Speaking to reporters at the scene this afternoon, the state governor of Lagos, Bola Tinubu, was careful to note that the cause of the blast had not yet been determined. Ballistics experts are to be dispatched to the site on Monday. Speculation about the cause of the explosion included talk of a bomb blast, perhaps linked to a bank robbery scheme, or an accident caused by a gas leak. ''There are over 30 bodies in the mortuary, and there could still be many more dead in the debris,'' the governor said. This afternoon, the Red Cross president, Emmanuel Ijewere, put the death toll at more than 20 people, but he said the number could be far higher. The only saving grace was that the blast happened on a Sunday. Because the area is packed with offices, the toll might have been much higher had the explosion occurred on a weekday. One of the world's most crowded cities, with a population estimated at 12 million to 15 million, Lagos is a lively, fractious and chaotic place even on an ordinary day. The most populous city in sub-Sarahan Africa, it is the commercial heart of Nigeria, a country with abundant oil yet still struggling to emerge from decades of military rule, political violence and crippling corruption. Nigeria is in the throes of historic federal elections, which are scheduled for April and riven by deep ethnic and religious divisions. The specter of political violence looms as the elections approach. Nigeria, with a population of 120 million, is the continent's most populous country and a political heavyweight, especially in West Africa. It is also among the world's biggest oil suppliers. The blast came as ethnic fighting resumed in the Warri region. According to a Reuters report, buildings were in flames, and street clashes that began on Friday between the Itsekiri and Urhobo ethnic groups left an unspecified number of dead. In Lagos, the building housing the Prudent Bank on its ground floor collapsed in the blast, bringing down three floors of apartments on top and sending a tower of smoke rising above the city, witnesses told journalists at the scene. Two other buildings nearby were also destroyed. An Associated Press correspondent reported seeing 10 crushed bodies, including one that could have been a child. Rescue workers continued to work through the rubble during the evening. The police had limited success in compelling people to leave nearby buildings that were in danger of collapse, Reuters said. The crowded district where the explosion took place is on Lagos Island, off the coast. The blast was a terrifying reminder of a huge explosion a year ago at an arms depot in Lagos that killed more than 1,000 people and left thousands more homeless. Most of the victims drowned in a canal as they tried to flee."
"Columbia's onboard computer hardware and software -- not the crew -- were driving when the craft made its fatal re-entry last Saturday. Those computer systems, state-of-the-art designs when the shuttle program began in the 1970's, detected a drag under Columbia's left wing and ordered flight-control jets to compensate by steering the craft to the right. Their performance will be investigated as part of the inquiry into why Columbia was destroyed, NASA officials say. The computers act as the electronic brain of the flight control system. Computer avionics experts say the shuttle program's hardware and software systems, despite their age, have a record of extraordinary reliability. The technology, they say, is a triumph of custom machines and programming code that has been designed and endlessly tested to perform flawlessly in the harsh conditions of space travel. For this specialized task, they say, mature computers and code are robust and trustworthy instead of an antiquated safety hazard. ''These systems are older, but they are highly reliable,'' said Norman F. Schneidewind, a computer scientist at the Naval Postgraduate School, who has worked with NASA. ''The design, testing and work processes are focused on making sure the technology works, all the time.'' In the last year or so, NASA did consider the option of using new avionics computers, according to people close to the space administration. Finding replacement components for the old machines has been a headache for NASA, and eventually the shuttles may switch. But there were other budget priorities for the administration, say these insiders, who add that safety was not the reason new computer systems were being considered. Besides, there are real risks to moving to newer computer systems, the experts point out. The main one is altering the complex interaction between the hardware and software, which can introduce bugs. And software bugs can have catastrophic consequences in space. In 1996, for example, the European Space Agency's Ariane 5 rocket, which took $7 billion and 10 years to build, exploded less than a minute into its maiden voyage because of a software bug. An investigation found that some new code had been added from the Ariane 4, and it had not been properly tested. As for the shuttle's systems, I.B.M. began development work on them in 1972, nine years before the first spacecraft was launched. The company chose the best and most appropriate pieces of technology from its various products and its research laboratories, and came up with a hybrid machine, the I.B.M. AP-101. Over the years, shuttle scientists have installed improvements to the AP-101, like solid-state electronics for its memory instead of magnetic disks. Yet the basic design of the five onboard AP-101 computers -- black cubes about 18 inches on a side -- remains the same. The programming language used for these unusual machines is similarly tailored for its task. It is called HAL/S (high-order assembly language/shuttle), and was specially developed for space-flight applications like instantaneous handling of streams of data from shuttle sensors. The AP-101 computers process data at a tiny fraction of the rate of today's personal computers. Yet today's computers need a lot of processing firepower because they routinely handle big graphics, as well as audio and video files. All of that is important for people playing computer games or downloading music over the Internet but not relevant to the shuttle's performance. The flight-control system on a shuttle craft is designed mainly to process sequence after sequence of numeric data. The data come from sensors on the guidance system, accelerometers measuring acceleration and gyros measuring the rotation of the craft. The onboard computers, experts say, are designed to process those chunks of numeric data at the rate of perhaps 1,000 times a second. ''That data coming out of the gyros and accelerometers is not going to come out faster,'' said Col. John Keesee, an Air Force aeronautical engineer and a senior lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''The guidance functions are not pushing you to faster processors.'' The shuttle's software team is famed in the industry for the flawless quality of its programming code. It is one of a handful of projects in the world to receive a Level 5 rating from Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute for the reliability of its code and the rigor of its testing processes. The guidance system program has more than 400,000 lines of code; recent versions have had less than one error -- and none that degraded the performance of the program, let alone raised safety concerns. The working environment of the coders who build the shuttle programs is orderly and regimented -- a world apart from that of young hackers, staying up all night to ship new products every few months. ''They have a system of process improvements, design reviews and testing procedures that almost no one else does,'' said Mr. Schneidewind, a software engineering expert, of the shuttle coders. But at least one expert -- Richard Doherty, a consulting engineer who did research for a member of the commission that investigated the Challenger explosion -- questioned whether the computers onboard the Columbia had all the information they needed. After tiles were damaged on takeoff, Mr. Doherty said, NASA could have sent up a few changes in the software guidance program to adjust for increased drag on the left side of the craft. ''It might have made some difference,'' Mr. Doherty theorized, ''but we'll never know how much.'' LOSS OF THE SHUTTLE: TECHNOLOGY"
"Powerful explosions outside two diplomatic offices shattered windows and nerves early today, leaving four people wounded and many others uncertain about the prospects for a peaceful solution to the political crisis here. One blast ripped the glass and steel facade of the Colombian Consulate downtown, twisting a thick steel entry gate and ruining two of the building's four floors. A second blast, outside the foreign aid office of the Spanish Embassy in a residential area, knocked a gate off its hinges and punched a hole through a wall. In both cases, people were wounded by flying glass, authorities said. The explosions, which the police said were extraordinarily large and which neighbors said felt like earthquakes, came two days after President Hugo Ch√°vez publicly berated Spain and Colombia for interfering in Venezuela's internal affairs. Mr. Ch√°vez, who has outlasted an attempted coup and an opposition strike, had been criticized for the arrest of an opposition leader as well as for not assisting Colombia in its fight against leftist guerrillas. The government denied any involvement in the blasts and ordered tighter security for foreign missions and the diplomatic corps. The deputy foreign minister, Ar√©valo M√©ndez, said the bombs were the work of a ''sick and confused mind that had nothing to do'' with any criticisms Mr. Ch√°vez might have voiced against other nations. ''We repudiate this act of terrorism,'' Vice President Jos√© Vicente Rangel said at an afternoon news conference. ''The government rejects any terrorist act, whatever it is, wherever it is, whoever the author. We reject any form of terrorism, whether it is from the state or from individuals.'' Diplomats from Colombia and Spain did not blame the government but did urge thorough investigations, as did the United States. The blasts, which occurred around 2:30 a.m. local time, also came one day before the resumption of talks between the government and the opposition, which only last week had agreed to tone down their accusations and reject violence. But the arrest last week of Carlos Fern√°ndez, a business leader who spearheaded the strike, had already increased skepticism over Mr. Ch√°vez's commitment to a peaceful resolution. ''This defines a new stage in the political situation in Venezuela, one in which there is greater chaos and violence and a president who is becoming more entrenched,'' said Michael Shifter, vice president for policy at the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. ''It makes it very hard to see negotiations, given this climate.'' It is just as difficult to know who is responsible for the bombs. Leaflets were found at the sites of both explosions, signed by an obscure group, the Bolivarian Liberation Force, and the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var Coordinator, Urban Militia. Juan Contreras, director of the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var Coordinator, told a local newspaper that his group was a cultural association and said whoever used its name was fighting ''a dirty war.'' Only two days ago, during his weekly television broadcast, Mr. Ch√°vez had lashed out at his critics, telling them to respect Venezuela's sovereignty. He said some of the nations that were faulting him for arresting the strike leader had supported the coup that failed to oust him last April. ''Where do Spain and Colombia want this to get to?'' he said during the broadcast. ''To break relations?'' A diplomat who is in close contact with the government and the opposition said the bombs were out of character for Venezuela, where previous explosions have been limited to grenades or pipe bombs left outside television stations. The jangle of thousands of shards of glass being swept away echoed through the street outside the Colombian Consulate, where the entry gate was twisted. The concussion from the blast smashed countless windows inside an office building across the street, where dazed residents slowly picked their way through small rooms. ''The strike had already paralyzed the country,'' said Alberto Buroz, the president of an environmental engineering firm whose offices were the most damaged in the building. ''Now with the few clients we have left, how can we attend to them? We have crossed the line. I don't know. I'd like to understand what will be the end of this story. But that has not been written yet.'' Outside, Marta Luc√≠a Var√≥n stood by a banner held aloft by a group of her countrymen from Colombia. They had come to the street in solidarity, she said, as soon as they heard the news. ''This violence was created by the Ch√°vez government,'' she said, despite protests from several Ch√°vez supporters near her. ''We fled violence in Colombia and chose Venezuela to make a living. And now we find this?''"
"Explosions apparently caused by homemade bombs ripped through cafeterias at two of China's most prominent universities around lunchtime today, Chinese officials and students said. At least nine people were wounded. There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the blasts at Qinghua and Beijing Universities and the motive was unclear, although the police were not calling it terrorism. The first blast, at about 11:40 a.m., took place in a new upscale restaurant favored by faculty members at Qinghua University. The second, less than two hours later, was strong enough to blow out panels of glass at the Nongyuan cafeteria at Beijing University. The police said the blasts appeared to have been caused by bombs made with dynamite. Students said the smell of gunpowder hung in the air. Within hours, the buildings housing the two cafeterias were cordoned off, and the immediate areas were patrolled by the police and members of China's State Security forces. But elsewhere on the two bustling campuses, it was business as usual on a foggy late winter's day, with students heading to classes, dinners and films; and although some students expressed alarm that such violence could intrude on this usually quiet setting, most took the news in stride. ''I heard the explosion, and it was a bit scary at first, but that passed very quickly since at first everyone thought it was just an accident,'' said a Beijing University undergraduate in jeans and a black down jacket who identified himself only by his surname, Tao. ''If this was America, by now I bet they would have evacuated the campus,'' he said. ''But that's not happening here.'' Most of the wounded were university workers and none were students. Tonight, the electronic bulletin board for Beijing University, normally a hotbed of student gossip, contained only official notices about the incident as well as a request for witnesses to come forward -- suggesting that student comments were being censored. Most students on the campus said they felt that the blasts were probably related to personal grudges or revenge. ''Why would a terrorist set off little explosions at two university cafeterias?'' asked Jian Qi, a graduate student at Beijing University. In a country where lawsuits and the court system are unreliable venues for those seeking justice, disgruntled citizens often solve disputes themselves. Guns are illegal, but small homemade bombs have been used as weapons because explosives are inexpensive and easy to buy. The police in Beijing were already on heightened alert because China's yearly Parliament, the National People's Congress, meets next week. The meeting this year is particularly important because it will be the backdrop for a leadership change, a rare event in China, with the current president, Jiang Zemin, retiring. Still, security on the two campuses was surprisingly light tonight. For many years after the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, all visitors to Beijing University were screened by police guards at the gates, because many of the student organizers were affiliated with the university. But that practice has recently waned, and tonight there was no attempt to check identification papers or parcels carried onto the campus."
"The captain and mate who were killed in a barge explosion at a Staten Island oil depot on Friday both understood what it meant to work on a barge carrying millions of gallons of gasoline: in addition to the potential for an accident, there were also long stretches of time away from home. But for the captain, John P. Kyne, 52, and the mate, Ford Ebanks, 24, the advantages -- including money, the sense of adventure and, most of all, the long stretches of free time -- outweighed the disadvantages. The job gave Mr. Kyne monthlong breaks that he filled with daily rounds of golf, and plenty of stories to tell the friends who would join him on the courses near his apartment in Huntsville, Ala. It allowed Mr. Ebanks to travel for weeks at a time to Honduras to visit his wife, Marlie, who was pregnant. But Mr. Ebanks never got to see their baby, who was born Thursday evening. And Mr. Kyne will not get to tell his golf buddies what could have been the most compelling story of his life. The two men died together on Friday morning when their barge exploded at an oil depot. Another man, Frank Scandariato, 48, an ExxonMobil depot employee working on shore, was injured in the accident. Last night, he was in critical but stable condition at Staten Island University Hospital with third-degree burns on his hands, arms and face. Yesterday, relatives and friends streamed into the peach house with white trim in North Miami, Fla., where Mr. Ebanks lived with his parents when he was not on the barge. He had moved to Florida with his parents when he was about 13, relatives said, but the family had returned to their native Honduras frequently. During one of those visits, on Easter 1997, he met his future wife. He called her Shorty, she called him Lucky, and in 1998 they married. On Thursday night, Mr. Ebanks, aboard the barge, received a cellphone call from his brother, Marlon L. Ebanks. There was good news, the brother said: Shorty had given birth to a baby girl. ''He started laughing,'' Marlon Ebanks, 31, recalled. The telephone connection was breaking up, but before the brothers hung up, they discussed Mr. Ebanks's plans to fly to Honduras next month, Marlon Ebanks said. Ford Ebanks had planned to return to Miami a few weeks later, this time with Marlie, the baby and the couple's toddler son, Usher. ''He was really excited,'' Marlon Ebanks said. ''He had a lot of plans. He'd be so happy that he could be here with his family.'' Ford Ebanks had worked for the barge owner, Bouchard Transportation, of Hicksville, N.Y., for about two and a half years, relatives said. Eventually, Marlon Ebanks said, his brother wanted to find a steady union job that would enable him to spend most nights at home. ''He liked it, but he said he wanted to work here on land, with the union, instead of traveling from his family too much,'' Marlon Ebanks said. Marlon Ebanks's ex-wife, Seldine D. McField, 27, said that when he was not up north working, Ford Ebanks would be home, hanging around with relatives and friends, grilling meat, trimming people's hair and dancing around to his favorite song, ''In da Club,'' by 50 Cent. At some point, she said, he wanted to return to Honduras with his family. ''He would talk about building his dream home back there,'' Ms. McField said. Mr. Kyne worked for Bouchard Transportation for about 18 years, a company spokeswoman said. But his friends said that at some point, he had quit for a more stable job working for a carpet store of which his brother was an owner. Sometime within the past year, his friends recalled, Mr. Kyne decided to return to his work as a barge captain. ''I think he missed it,'' said Jackie Handley, 49, a frequent golf partner and close friend who lives in Decatur, Ala. He also missed the golf, said Elvis N. Larkin, 56, another friend and fellow golfer. ''I think he liked it because it gave him time to work at his passion when he had time off, to play golf for two or three weeks,'' Mr. Larkin said. Mr. Kyne felt that his job was dangerous, Mr. Handley said. But he did not make a big deal about it. ''He had just mentioned that the barges that he was towing up and down through there just had a tremendous amount of gasoline on them,'' Mr. Handley said. ''He knew the danger that was involved.'' ''It takes a special person to do what he was doing,'' he said. ''But it suited him and his lifestyle.'' He relished telling funny tales about the odd jobs he had held in the past, Mr. Handley said. One of the best stories, he said, was when he worked for a logging company and he and a partner were caught in the woods in the middle of a surprise blizzard. ''They thought they were going to be stranded,'' Mr. Handley recalled. Had he survived the explosion, Mr. Handley said, ''He would have had plenty to say, I'm sure.''"
"A gas explosion ripped through a top-floor apartment in Stuyvesant Town yesterday, injuring a 51-year-old man and forcing the evacuation of more than 100 other residents of the complex on the East Side. The authorities said they had yet to determine the exact cause of the blast, which shook much of the building at 21 Stuyvesant Oval shortly before 5 p.m. But they said that the victim was found lying near the gas stove in his kitchen, and that gas from the stove appeared to be the cause. Investigators said they found evidence suggesting a suicide attempt. A Fire Department spokesman said late last night that all the stove's jets had been turned on, and all the windows and doors in the apartment had been sealed. The victim, whose identity was not disclosed, was in serious condition last night at New York Weill Cornell Center with burns on his hands and face, the authorities said. They said his injuries did not appear to be life threatening. Seven other people sustained minor injuries, including three firefighters who were treated at Bellevue Hospital Center, two people who were treated at Beth Israel Hospital and two others who were treated at the scene. Fire officials described the explosion, in Apartment 12D, one of about 100 apartments in the building, as unusually powerful, since it blasted through a cinder-block and concrete wall separating 12D from a neighboring apartment. Almost all the interior walls of both two-bedroom apartments were demolished. ''The explosion was very powerful, since those walls are six inches thick,'' said Deputy Assistant Chief Patrick McNally. The force of the blast also blew a window air-conditioner and 12 windows from their frames. Brian Tregerman, 15, who lives on the third floor, described a resounding shock when the blast occurred. ''I was lying on my bed and the entire building shook,'' he said. ''Then all this glass fell from the windows above,'' he said. The explosion prompted a huge response by emergency workers, utility crews and more than 100 firefighters, who evacuated those who remained in the building and cordoned off a section East 20th Street. The building is on an interior oval in the Stuyvesant Town complex, south of 20th Street and east of First Avenue. Fire officials said the explosion did not result in a fire. But Consolidated Edison workers were dispatched immediately to the scene. They turned off the gas to 21 Stuyvesant Oval by 5:05 p.m., according to D. Joy Faber, a spokeswoman for the utility. Investigators for the city's Department of Buildings were checking early last night for structural damage, and had found evidence that an exterior wall on the 12th floor had been bowed out by the force of the blast. The Fire Department shored up the building, because the exterior wall was in danger of collapsing, a department spokesman said. Around 11:30 p.m., residents of the building's lower floors were able to begin returning home, but the 10th, 11th and 12th floors had to remain vacated for at least a day, the Fire Department spokesman said."
"The Coast Guard opened a formal board of inquiry yesterday into the spectacular barge explosion that killed two crew members and injured a worker at a Staten Island oil depot, and investigators seeking the cause of the blast focused on an electric pump that may have sparked while millions of gallons of gasoline were being unloaded. The pump aboard the 200-foot barge that exploded Friday morning at the ExxonMobil Terminal on the Arthur Kill had been repaired by a mechanic in the hours before the unloading began, but investigators said the problem with the pump and the details of the repair were unknown pending a talk with the mechanic, whose name was not released. The injured worker, Frank Scandariato, 48, an ExxonMobil employee, remained in critical condition at Staten Island University Hospital with third-degree burns on his hands, arms and face. He told investigators that he had heard a grinding noise in the barge pump moments before the blast, which killed the barge captain, John Kyne, 52, of Huntsville, Ala., and the mate, Ford Ebanks, 24, of Miami. ''We are greatly saddened by the injuries and loss of life, and extend our deepest sympathy to the families,'' said Hank Muller, the manager of the ExxonMobil Terminal. He also expressed regret over what he called the inconvenience caused to local residents, some of whom were shaken or knocked down by the force of the blast, which also damaged homes and businesses for miles around. The authorities said the explosion appeared to be an accident, not the work of terrorists. Despite suspicion concerning the pump, investigators said they were not ruling out other possible causes of the explosion, which touched off an inferno of burning gasoline and a towering cloud of smoke that drifted over Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens and Nassau County. A Coast Guard spokesman, Chief Warrant Officer Steve Sapp, said the board of inquiry was convened in New York yesterday under the direction of Commander Patrick Little, of the Coast Guard's marine safety office in Providence, R.I. The panel was expected to take weeks to consider the cause of the explosion and make recommendations for averting similar disasters. While New York police investigators and fire marshals are participating, the investigation is being coordinated by the Coast Guard because it is responsible for licensing ships and crews. ExxonMobil and the barge owner, Bouchard Transportation, of Hicksville, N.Y., pledged their cooperation. Representative Vito Fossella, a Republican who represents Staten Island, called on the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to help coordinate tests of air and water quality. Initial environmental tests found no contaminants in the air or water as a result of the explosion. The Coast Guard also sent out teams of observers yesterday to examine the shoreline of the Arthur Kill for environmental damage and to look for navigational hazards. The Coast Guard was restricting shipping in the Arthur Kill to ensure safe passage. The kill, a 12-mile waterway between Staten Island and New Jersey, is lined with the giant storage tanks of ExxonMobil, ConocoPhilips, Amerada Hess and other petroleum companies. Ordinarily, 50 tankers, barges and other carriers pass through the kill daily. On Friday, the Army Corps of Engineers surveyed the channel for chunks of the exploded barge and other possible hazards to shipping. Mr. Sapp said the survey team found no hazards, but the B-125, the barge that exploded and sank off Port Mobil, remained in the water and was a hazard. Yesterday, the Coast Guard posted the cutter Hammerhead and a 41-foot rescue boat at the north and south ends of the kill. Like traffic officers, they were allowing only one vessel at a time to navigate in the waterway, north or south. As a result, he acknowledged, vessels were backing up off Wards Point at the southern tip, and off Tufts Point at the north end. It was unclear how many vessels were caught in the watergoing traffic jam. The restrictions were to continue until the B-125 barge was removed or the Coast Guard was satisfied that it was no hazard to shipping, but it was unclear how long that would be. The ExxonMobil Terminal remained closed to shipping yesterday, but ExxonMobil said it expected to keep customers throughout the Northeast supplied from alternative sources. The company also said that a variety of contractors had been retained to clean up the site, which was not seriously damaged beyond the burning of a pier and a dockside shed. A second barge near the one that exploded caught fire and its bow was damaged, Mr. Sapp said. It was carrying a relatively small amount of fuel oil, which did not ignite. Still afloat, that barge was escorted by tugboats and a Coast Guard vessel to an anchorage at Wards Point, where the fuel oil was taken off. Public officials, including Capt. Craig Bone, the Coast Guard's Captain of the Port of New York and New Jersey, praised firefighters and other emergency workers for a swift response that kept the flames from spreading to scores of nearby tanks holding fuel oil, gasoline, kerosene and other petroleum products, thus averting a disastrous chain of explosions. Officials also said that there had been no major environmental damage to the shorelines on either side of the kill, mainly because the cargo that exploded was gasoline, not oil. Gasoline evaporates and burns rapidly, and although 100,000 barrels -- more than 4 million gallons -- were involved, the ensuing fire was contained. It continued to burn harmlessly yesterday. An oil explosion would probably have left a petroleum slick over much of the Arthur Kill. Prall's Island, five miles north of Port Mobil on the kill, is a nesting area for herons and other birds. Mr. Ebanks, 24, of Miami, was a Honduran immigrant who worked on the barge for four years. Yesterday, his brother, Henry Ebanks, told The Associated Press that about 11 hours before he died, his wife had given birth to his first child, a daughter, in Honduras."
"A fire at a Newton, N.J., fuel depot continued to burn yesterday, preventing hundreds of people from returning to their homes and keeping authorities from fully investigating the blaze. On Friday, hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes after a propane truck exploded at the depot, run by Able Energy Products. The depot is a major heating oil and diesel fuel storage site for the company, which provides 10,000 customers with propane gas. ''The fire is still burning and we really don't know when it will go out,'' said Camille Furgiuele, the Newton town manager. About 10 people, including firefighters and some employees of Able Energy, suffered minor injuries, she said. They were treated at Newton Memorial Hospital and released, Ms. Furgiuele said. Ms. Furgiuele said authorities had evacuated nearly 1,000 homes, businesses and apartment complexes within three-quarters of a mile of the depot. John Vrabel, the manager of the fuel company, said investigators had determined that none of the underground storage tanks at the depot had leaked. ''They've isolated the problem to one of the propane vehicles,'' he said, ''but it's still not clear what triggered the explosion.'' He said company investigators had been on the scene since the fire began. Mr. Vrabel said that the timing of the explosion, just after 5 p.m., and quick thinking by employees helped keep the number of injuries relatively low. Shortly before the explosion, an employee became concerned about the condition of one of the propane trucks, and several workers began alerting emergency officials. The fire is believed to be the first since Able Energy took over the depot in the mid-1990's, he said. ''A little earlier in the day, and there would have been more people at the site,'' he said. ''We're most grateful that they took such decisive action so quickly.''"
"In the deadliest attack in a recent surge of violence in the southern Philippines, a bomb at an international airport today killed at least 21 people -- including an American Baptist missionary -- and wounded 170 others as they took shelter in a shed from the rain. The American missionary, William P. Hyde, 59, had lived and worked in the Philippines since 1978. He had gone to the airport in Davao City on Mindanao to meet Barbara Wallis Stevens, 33, and her family, who were arriving from Manila. Mrs. Stevens, her 10-month-old son, Nathan, and her daughter, Sarah, were slightly wounded. With her husband, Mark, who was not wounded, Mrs. Stevens has worked in the Philippines as a Baptist missionary since 2000. ''I just heard it explode to my side,'' she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. ''I was carrying my infant son so I grabbed my daughter and picked her up and ran away.'' Mr. Hyde was a former music teacher who lived here with his wife, Lyn Gage Hyde, and their two children, said Bill Bangham, a member of the Southern Baptist International Mission Board in Richmond, Va. ''Our hearts go out to these families and their co-workers,'' Larry Cox, a spokesman for the board, said in a statement. ''We are moving quickly to assist the missionaries affected by this tragedy.'' The Baptists say they have 5,441 missionaries around the world and claim to have converted 395,000 people to Christianity in 2001 alone. Most of Mindanao's 18 million people, like most of the 76 million in the country, are Christian. There are also five million Muslims on Mindanao. Rebel groups have been fighting there for 25 years for a separate Muslim homeland. The Philippine military recently opened an offensive against the largest of those groups, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, and it has blamed the group for a series of recent bombings. A spokesman for the front, speaking to a radio station, denied responsibility for the airport attack. [The authorities said Wednesday that five Moro members had been arrested in connection with the blast, The Associated Press reported.] [However, the Abu Sayyaf guerrilla group said it carried out the bombing, Agence France-Presse reported from Manila on Wednesday.] United States troops are on a training mission on Mindanao, but they are based in Zamboanga, 220 miles west of Davao City. In recent months, there have also been bomb attacks in Zamboanga. In another bombing today, a military spokesman said an explosion in Tagum, an hour's drive north of Davao City, wounded two people. Also today, the police said a town hall in Cotabato, a province in central Mindanao, had been destroyed by a rocket-propelled grenade. A fuel tank maintained by the government's energy department in another province was also attacked today. Last month, a car bomb exploded outside the airport terminal in Cotabato City, killing one person. In the last week, explosions have destroyed electric towers in Mindanao, causing blackouts across much of the island. The waiting area at the Davao airport is about 15 yards from the main entrance. Security has always been light, and visitors outside the main building are not checked. ''At the time that the bomb went off, it was raining, and many people were seeking refuge from the rain in the waiting shed,'' Abner Mendador, a private pilot whose house is within the airport compound, told reporters. Terry Labado, an airport official, said: ''It was a very, very loud explosion. I saw bodies flying.'' President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo had recently ordered the military to step up security on Mindanao. ''This is a brazen act of terrorism that will not go unpunished,'' she said in a statement late today. THREATS AND RESPONSES: ASIA"
"A propane truck exploded at a fuel depot here this afternoon, forcing the evacuation of about 700 people living within a half-mile radius and causing eight minor injuries, the authorities said. The explosion, which broke windows in nearby buildings, occurred just after 5 p.m. at Able Energy Products, which provides 10,000 customers with propane gas. The depot also contains underground storage tanks for diesel fuel and heating oil, which were not ignited by the explosion. The number of buildings and propane trucks damaged or destroyed by the blast was not known. Firefighters from 19 towns and a foam-spraying truck from the Army's Picatinny Arsenal were used to fight the fire, which was expected to burn at least until midnight. John Vrabel, the manager of the fuel company, said that at the time of the blast five employees were in the yard and about five drivers had just returned from deliveries. Each truck can hold 2,000 to 3,000 gallons of liquid propane; it is believed that the truck that exploded was not full. None of the employees were hurt. The injured included two firefighters, one with an injured shoulder and one who stepped on a nail, and six residents, all of whom were treated at Newton Memorial Hospital and released. Before the explosion, an employee noticed something unusual about one of the trucks, leading employees to dial 911 and begin alerting neighbors, Mr. Vrabel said. Many of the people evacuated lived in Gateway Condominiums, a complex of 102 apartments about 200 yards from the depot. Fire Chief Mike Alvarez said he was not sure of the cause of the explosion. He was leaning toward calling the fire accidental, he said, but the investigation is continuing. Camille Furgiuele, the town manager, said, ''There was a leak, and they couldn't contain it.'' A fuel depot has been at the site, on Diller Avenue, since the 1950's. The blast shook the residents of this small, quaint town, which is the Sussex County seat. The town's population is 8,244. Nicole Howey, a high school junior, was with a classmate and friend, Courtney Riepe, in Ms. Howey's kitchen at 3 Diller Avenue when the explosion occurred. ''It was just a big, huge explosion,'' Ms. Howey said at the Merriam Avenue Elementary School, where about 70 of the evacuees were sheltered. ''The whole house shook. We thought at first that the roof or something had caved in.'' The girls ran upstairs to check, they said, and then went out into the street and saw a crowd of people. ''There was just black smoke and hundreds of pieces of paper raining down all over,'' Ms. Riepe said. ''There were people all over. All you could see was black smoke.'' A man who said he was a Vietnam War veteran but declined to be identified by name said the blast reminded him of artillery fire. ''It was just like hearing incoming -- it was that noisy,'' he said. ''It was a tremendous concussion.'' He said the blast blew out the windows of his house and buckled its walls."
"The Coast Guard began hearing public testimony yesterday in its formal investigation into the huge barge explosion at a Staten Island fuel depot on Feb. 21 that killed two crew members and severely injured a worker. Investigators have been focusing on a pump that may have malfunctioned, though an employee testified yesterday that the pump had been tested before the blast. The investigation, led by Cmdr. Patrick E. Little of the Coast Guard's marine safety office in Providence, R.I., is intended to determine the cause of the explosion as well as to gather information to help prevent or better respond to similar problems in the future, he said in his opening statement. Officials plan to question 17 witnesses by day's end tomorrow, and to reconvene a little later with a second group of witnesses. Lt. Comdr. Joseph Fischetti, a Coast Guard spokesman, said that Commander Little would probably not submit his final report for about six months. Although the investigation is being coordinated by the Coast Guard, which is responsible for licensing ships and crews, the National Transportation Safety Board is also participating because it is responsible for determining the cause of major accidents, Commander Little said. Yesterday's session focused on establishing what was happening at the terminal just before the deadly blast at Port Mobil on Arthur Kill. The explosion occurred after the unloading of about 50,000 barrels of unleaded gasoline from a 200-foot barge, killing the vessel's captain, John Kyne, and mate, Ford Ebanks. Mr. Ebank's family has filed a $10 million lawsuit against Bouchard Transportation, a Hicksville, N.Y., company that owns the barge and employed both men. Lawyers for both families were at the hearing, along with representatives of Bouchard; ExxonMobil, which uses the depot to store motor fuels and heating oil from vessels and from a pipeline running northeast from oil refineries in the Gulf Coast; and SeaRiver Maritime Inc., an ExxonMobil marine transportation affiliate. Theofanis Tskas, a Bouchard employee who had serviced the suspect pump hours before the blast, said that it had tested successfully, Lieutenant Commander Fischetti said, emphasizing that the pump was only one system under investigation."
"Before Wednesday, the 255 people who worked at this town's bustling medical-supply plant counted themselves lucky to work hard shifts mixing hot chemicals and stamping out syringes for $11 or $12 an hour. Good blue-collar jobs are hard to come by in Kinston, where tobacco and textiles reigned, then vanished, nothing has taken their place, and unemployment always seems to get worse. But after the Wednesday afternoon explosion that set the West Pharmaceutical Services factory ablaze, killing 3 workers and injuring 37, those who emerged unscathed or had been scheduled for a later shift were counting their blessings for a different reason. ''I wanted to come at 11 to work some overtime, but they wouldn't let me,'' said Tammy Smith, who lost two friends in the explosion and said she would probably have been killed had she been on the job. Today, federal investigators who converged on the remains of the plant focused on whether dust created by the mixing and drying of chemicals that form rubber and plastic could have caused the blast. As fires smoldered in a steady mist, law enforcement and safety investigators interviewed scores of survivors and other employees of the factory, seeking clues to whatever -- or whoever -- had set off the explosion. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was treating the scorched factory, which made syringes and parts for intravenous hookups, as a crime scene. While fire marshals said the area was still too hot this afternoon to allow investigators in, the bureau's agents were expected to don safety suits and start sifting for clues later tonight or tomorrow, officials said. But accident investigators from the United States Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board said their interviews with plant managers and workers today led them to zero in on dust as a possible cause of the blast. Workers said the explosion occurred in a part of the factory known as automated compounding systems, the half of the plant that makes rubber and plastic from chemicals like polymers, sulfur, clay and oils. They said the blast started in or near one of the two mixers that combine those ingredients under heat, before the material becomes sheets of plastic that are used on the other side of the plant to make its finished products. Investigators agreed with the employees' account. ''Dust poses a potential ignition hazard,'' said Sandy Gilmour, a spokesman for the chemical safety board, in the same way that a spark in a grain elevator can cause a tremendous explosion. Mr. Gilmour said the board would have the chemicals used at the factory analyzed to learn under what conditions they could ignite. He said that the board's experts were looking for possible sources of ignition, but that those they had identified so far were all contained within the plant's components and thus should not have posed a danger. One worker, Wayne Brown, 32, said the company had installed a new mixer -- a giant bowl, he called it --in late December. The other was replaced a year earlier, he said. Mr. Brown said he would have been at a mixer himself but was not due at work until shortly after the explosion. Two of the three people killed were working at the mixers, co-workers and relatives said. They were identified as Faye Wilkins, 50, and William Gray, 52. Ms. Wilkins was pinned under steel beams and screamed for help. It took firefighters 10 minutes to reach her through a maze of steel and toppled walls, and she died before they arrived, said Tommy Howard, the chief of a local volunteer fire department, who was among the first to arrive. The third worker killed, identified as James Byrd, was an employee of a contractor that did custodial work at the factory, workers said. Many of the worst injured were working on the automated compounding side of the factory, they said. Ten people were in critical condition today at the North Carolina Jaycee Burn Center in Chapel Hill, some with burns over 70 percent of their bodies. Most of the 17 workers still hospitalized were employees at West Pharmaceutical Services, but a few miles away in Goldsboro, Wayne Memorial Hospital's one remaining patient from the explosion was a firefighter who had been overcome by smoke. Those who felt the blast up close had a hard time describing it. Richard Tyson, his two sons walking on either side of him, said it was like nothing he had seen. ''I was in Vietnam,'' Mr. Tyson said, before sinking into his sons' arms, sobbing. ''I can't compare Vietnam to this.'' The director of the North Carolina Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Division, John Johnson, said his agency's boiler-pressure experts and others from the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration would examine the factory's manufacturing processes, which include heat-and-pressure devices similar to autoclaves. ''We're looking at the chemical interactions between pressure and temperature, those kinds of things, because the chemicals they had in this plant aren't the kinds of things that are going to blow up under normal circumstances,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''They didn't have a large inventory of dangerous chemicals. It's not like an ammunition dump -- it was a relatively benign facility from a chemical standpoint.'' The state labor commissioner, Cherie K. Berry, said she intended to balance her department's enforcement and job-protection missions. ''We need to convince this company very quickly to rebuild this plant very quickly,'' Ms. Berry said. Indeed, as Gov. Mike Easley, Senator John Edwards and other officials made their way among the dozens of workers who gathered to be interviewed by investigators, it was the chief executive of West Pharmaceuticals, Don Morel, who received the most attention. Patrinia Faison, a West employee, said: ''There's really no jobs here. And that was one of the best companies here that was paying any money. Now we don't know what we're going to do. Lord knows, I hope they rebuild it.'' In an interview, Mr. Morel said his priority was the families of the victims, the wounded workers, and his displaced employees; the company said today that it would pay workers through the end of February. Mr. Morel said he was also rushing to see that the company's other plants across the country picked up production. For this close-knit county seat of 25,000, the reality that one of its largest and best-regarded employers had been dealt a devastating blow left residents contemplating a streak of bad luck that has upended thousands of lives in recent years. Hurricane Floyd in 1999 destroyed hundreds of homes. Textile mills, tobacco processors and a DuPont plant have all closed or cut back, costing an estimated 4,000 jobs. The explosion seemed likely to add to that total, officials said. And worse, it happened on the edge of what was supposed to be the catalyst for Kinston's economic revival, a multimillion-dollar airport industrial park called the Global TransPark. The runway extension that gave little Lenoir County the state's longest commercial airstrip, and helped lure major air cargo tenants to a place with few other connections to the outside world, had finally opened on Dec. 16. Now the Global TransPark is getting its first national exposure -- and for this. ''We had a lot of hopes for the future of our transport facility,'' said Van Braxton, a City Council member. ''This is just a devastating thing to have happen.''"
"Bombs exploded outside three mosques in this southern Philippine city early today in what the police said may have been retaliation for a bombing Wednesday near a ferry terminal that killed 16 people and injured 50. The police said no one was killed or injured in the mosque explosions, which occurred hours before President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo arrived here to meet with authorities about the terminal bombing. That explosion occurred just half a mile from the city's airport, where a powerful bomb in a passenger waiting area killed 23 people last month, including an American missionary. Authorities blamed the Moro Islamic Liberation Front for the airport bombing. The group, which has been fighting for a separate Islamic state for more than 25 years, has denied any involvement. The police said they did not know who exploded the bomb near the ferry terminal or who attacked the mosques. Lt. Gen. Rodolfo Garcia, the armed forces vice chief of staff, said the mosque attacks might be in retaliation for the terminal bombing. Muslim leaders in Davao City, which is on the island of Mindanao, have appealed to residents to be calm and to not jump to conclusions about the bombings pending an investigation by the police. A spokesman for the Moro Islamic Liberation Front said today that the mosque attacks ''could have been aimed at really igniting a Muslim-Christian war'' on Mindanao. The Communist-led National Democratic Front, whose New People's Army operates in Davao City and neighboring areas, condemned the mosque attacks but blamed the Arroyo administration. It said the attacks were meant to sabotage peace negotiations between the government and Muslim insurgents and to justify what the group called a ''sustained policy of all-out war in Mindanao.'' Mrs. Arroyo met with investigators working on the terminal bombing and visited some of the injured in the hospital. ''This is a grim reminder that we must always be alert and watchful, and those who wish to do us harm in a manner that creates a wide swath of fear must not intimidate us,'' she said. She also declared a ''state of lawless violence'' in Davao City and ordered the military to take the lead in what she called a crackdown ''on these lawless elements and terrorists.'' ''This is a total war that requires the full attention and resources of the entire community,'' Mrs. Arroyo said. Civil libertarians, however, cautioned the government against using the bombings to justify attacks on freedoms. Marie Hilao Enriquez of the Manila-based human-rights group Karapatan said the declaration of a ''state of lawless violence'' was alarming. ''It is during these times that we are most vulnerable to attacks by the government itself,'' she said. Ms. Enriquez cited a similar declaration by the government in 2001 covering the island of Basilan, where members of the extremist group Abu Sayyaf were hiding. She said the crackdown by the police and military resulted in the arrest of 121 people suspected of being members of Abu Sayyaf who are still in jail ''despite overwhelming evidence of innocence.''"
"At times, this war has felt like an abstraction for the American side, a near industrial exercise involving coordinated airstrikes against a specific grid on the map, followed by artillery strikes aimed with computer guidance systems, followed by tanks and then by infantry. Today, while some of the killing was done from the air and with artillery, two Iraqi soldiers on a roadside were in grenade-throwing range, hiding in the bushes as they made what would turn out to be their final strike. The Iraqi attack came as American forces moved to seize the last of three cities in a religious triangle here -- including Najaf and Karbala -- where Shiite Muslims have generally opposed the government of Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Muslim. The tanks rolled first toward this town, about 50 miles south of Baghdad, where Iraqi authorities say dozens of civilians have been killed in recent days in American attacks. They were followed by infantry trucks carrying about 120 soldiers from the Third Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division. The soldiers got off the vehicles to check a grain warehouse at the side of the road. Sgt. Chuck Shy, a mechanic who had volunteered to help drive the troops into combat, hopped down. ''All I could see was a muzzle flash from the bushes,'' he said. He remembers diving to the ground, returning fire, a loud explosion, a bright flash. A grenade had been hurled from those bushes. It landed 10 feet from Sergeant Shy, then burst into uncountable bits of shrapnel. A few pieces tore into his face. Stunned, he hustled to the other side of the truck. ''I'm a soldier, but I'm a mechanic,'' he said. ''I mean, we're trained for this, but I clean my gun once a week, that's about it.'' The blast echoed down the convoy. Eight or nine vehicles to the rear, Sgt. Maj. Iuniasolua Savusa heard the explosion and rushed toward it, ordering the soldiers to take up combat positions along the shoulders of the road. He reached Sergeant Shy's truck. ''I asked, 'Where did the grenade come from?' '' Sergeant Major Savusa said. ''I told him, 'It came from the bushes,' '' Sergeant Shy recalled. The sergeant major reached onto the front seat of a truck to get a grenade from another soldier. Sergeant Major Savusa worked methodically. As shots rang from the foliage a few yards away, he unpeeled the top of the protective canister, pulled the safety pin, and lobbed the grenade into the bushes. ''He threw it overhand, and that was the end of the firing from the bushes,'' Sergeant Shy said. ''He came down here like John Wayne.'' Afterward, three or four other Iraqis retreated, firing as they went, according to the Americans. ''I swear I could hear the bullets going past,'' Lt. Eldred Ramtahall said. Brig. Gen. Benjamin C. Freakley, deputy commander of the 101st Airborne Division, strode up to the fighting, yelling at the soldiers to spread out so that a single grenade could not kill a dozen soldiers at a time. A voice answered: ''Sir, are you crazy? You don't belong up here.'' General Freakley answered: ''That's all right. But right now you need to disperse. You O.K., boys?'' Another voice answered. ''Sir, I don't think I've ever been more scared.'' The general answered, ''You'll be fine. Just fight through it.'' About 10 or 15 feet away, the body of one of the two slain Iraqi soldiers lay face down in the dust, fingers partially clenched. His uniform was dark olive, almost black; the boots were new; his hair looked to have been freshly trimmed in a military cut; he seemed to have a sturdy, muscular build. ''That was a suicide mission, to take on so many soldiers at this close distance, when the soldiers have so much more than you,'' Sergeant Major Savusa said. General Freakley suggested that the Iraqis might have been frightened from their hiding spot when the infantry soldiers left the trucks and started walking around just a few feet away. On the other side of the road, the campsite for the Iraqi team was still fresh. Blankets were placed neatly on the ground, a tea set was stacked up and half-eaten pita bread was left on a plate. A T-shirt, apparently field-laundered, swung from a tree limb for drying. When the fighting had quieted, the general called to Staff Sgt. James Massey and Pvt. Rob Maher to retrieve blankets from the Iraqi camp, to wrap the bodies. The dead men had fine watches. One wore a wedding band. The blankets were of good quality, it seemed to Private Maher. ''The way I look at it, he's just a soldier, doing our job,'' he said. Sergeant Massey answered: ''True. And the job is dog eat dog.'' They carried the blankets to the bodies. The air heaved and spun with humidity. In the trenches, the American soldiers fidgeted, sipped water, watched for more fire from the warehouse. A breeze passed, and set swaying the ferns on the side of the road where the Iraqis had hidden, and where they now lay still. A NATION AT WAR: IN THE FIELD | 101ST AIRBORNE DIVISION"
"Two electrical workers were seriously injured yesterday and three received treatment for smoke inhalation after an explosion in the basement of a vacant commercial building in Lower Manhattan, a fire official said. The explosion occurred at 4:23 p.m. in the building at 90 Rector Street, which was once a Bank of New York office, said the official, Deputy Fire Chief John Bley. According to Chief Bley, an electrical crew was working there when a transformer blew up, knocking one electrician unconscious and badly burning him. He and another electrical worker were taken to St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital, and three others were taken to New York Weill Cornell Center, a Fire Department spokesman said. Their conditions were not available last night. The explosion set off a large electrical fire that moved quickly through the basement of the building to the ground floor. Three large windows facing the street were blown out, and firefighters had to crawl through 150 feet of darkness to reach the injured workers. Six firefighters were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation."
"Lance Cpl. James Klingel of the Marines finds himself lost in thought these days when he is not struggling with the physical pain, his mind wandering from images of his girlfriend back in Ohio to the sight of an exploding fireball to the sounds of twisting metal. Often, Corporal Klingel says, he is jolted from sleep at the National Naval Medical Center here, at times because of the aches and throbs in his right arm and right leg, and at other times because of the images of the Iraq war that the chaplains say will not likely go away soon. More than two weeks after being seriously wounded by a rocket-propelled grenade that hit his armored vehicle, Corporal Klingel says he is glad to begin walking again, but disheartened because he will most likely limp the rest of his life and need to use a cane. In the worst moments, though, Corporal Klingel, a scout, said he questioned the legitimacy of his emotional pain as he considered the marine in the next bed, Staff Sgt. Eric Alva, a distance runner whose right leg was blown off by a land mine, or Seaman Brian Alaniz, a Navy medic down the hall who lost his right leg when a mine exploded under him as he rushed to aid Sergeant Alva. ''It's kind of hard to feel sorry for yourself when so many people were hurt worse or died,'' said Corporal Klingel, 21, who added that it was about time for another appointment with a chaplain. In news conferences and television appearances carefully orchestrated by military officials, many wounded service members here and at other hospitals displayed self-assurance and confidence in response to questions about their fears and futures. But in long conversations, many patients here tell of visits to chaplains and other counselors, as well as fright, remorse and other hard-to-explain feelings as some of the long-term physical and emotional effects of the war become evident. For people like Sergeant Alva, 32, a supply chief who says he felt a sense of responsibility for many of the younger marines under him, stepping on a mine and losing his leg has been not just a physical ordeal. When military officials had him appear on television to discuss his injuries and the war, Sergeant Alva, who promised to run again in the Marine Corps Marathon, appeared confident and sturdy. But in more private moments last week in the hospital, Sergeant Alva acknowledged that he had anger that he directed inward and toward the news media that he said were too hard on soldiers and a public that he said that did not really understand the costs of war. ''There is no point in explaining how I feel,'' he said, ''because no one really is going to be able to understand it.'' For the 495 wounded service members, recovery will continue long after most other Americans have moved on other things, as they try to stitch back the pieces of their lives. For many, their time at Bethesda and other military medical centers is the last stop on the road home, a chance to learn how to live without an arm or a leg, to battle long-lasting pain, to cope with loss of independence and to heal emotional scars that can be as acute as physical damage. Corporal Klingel said that when his unit, which was providing security for a convoy under sniper fire from men in civilian clothes outside Baghdad, was attacked, he heard a thud followed by a bang and then saw orange fire and the door of his vehicle fly toward him. His right arm was broken. Shrapnel pierced his right leg and other parts of his body. In that battle, he said, more than 20 other marines were wounded, and at least one was killed. The image of the bloodied body of the dead marine is stuck in his head, as well as that of the dead and wounded Iraqis who were caught in the crossfire. ''It's something I don't even want to think about,'' he said. Corporal Klingel said he was cheered this week when President Bush and his wife, Laura, made the rounds, visiting dozens of wounded sailors and marines here and at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, several miles south in Washington. Standing in front of a statue called ''The Unspoken Bond,'' which shows a corpsman, as Navy medics are called, carrying an injured marine, Mr. Bush praised the heroism of the wounded and the work of the doctors here. But Corporal Klingel said that many here did not feel much like heroes. He said he went to visit a chaplain the next day because of the dreams he was wrestling with nightly. Explaining that he felt that his sense of safety and security ''was taken away in an instant'' on the day of the attack, the corporal said he told the chaplain in an hour-and-a-half conversation that he worried that long after he recovered physically he would struggle with the images in his head. ''He listened and told me it was normal, and that everything would be all right, eventually,'' Corporal Klingel said. A first brush with death has had profound effects even on longtime officers. A senior officer, Lt. Col. Jonathan Ewers, a Marine lawyer based at Camp Pendleton, Calif., had not seen combat in his 19 years in the military. He spent the 1991 Persian Gulf war stationed in Hawaii. But on March 22, as he was riding in a Humvee through a British-controlled area of southern Iraq in search of the father of an injured Iraqi boy who had been found by marines, Colonel Ewers came under attack. The 43-year-old colonel remembers hearing what he believes were rocket-propelled grenades coming out of nowhere followed by bursts of small arms fire before he felt wetness and numbness in his left arm, as blood came pouring through the sleeve of his fatigues. Before the firefight was over several minutes later, Colonel Ewers was shot in the other arm and his right foot. ''It was the first time I had been attacked, and it still has me a little bit shaken,'' he said. ''At each turn, we were hit with another attack, and I was just convinced that it was it.'' For some people like Pfc. Donald R. Schafer, 23, who was critically wounded on April 5, the effects of their injuries on their families are the greatest worry. After driving an hour from her house in Essex, Md., Private Schafer's mother, Laura Brune, arrived at Walter Reed, where Army officials said her son was undergoing surgery. But he was not there. Later, military officials sorted out the mistake and sent her to Bethesda, where Private Schafer was in good condition with bullet wounds in the right arm. ''I'm not looking forward to my mom having to take care of me,'' Private Schafer said. For many who were seriously injured, the burden on their families for help in recovering will be great. Sergeant Alva, who has had 10 operations since stepping on the mine on March 22, blames himself for the injuries of Seaman Alaniz, who is 28. If he had not been dumb enough to step on the mine, Sergeant Alva concluded, his friend would have never been injured. There had been warnings about mines, Sergeant Alva said, but the general feeling was that most of the mines had been cleared from the area where his convoy was moving. Sergeant Alva said he did not think much of it when he walked around his Humvee on a break to grab a meal. The next thing he remembers was falling on his back, and then seeing several people rush toward him, including Seaman Alaniz. Sergeant Alva, who said he did not even realize that he had lost his leg until hours after the explosion, did not find out until days later at a military medical center in Kuwait that Seaman Alaniz had survived. Seaman Alaniz, who has been learning to use crutches, not only lost his right leg, but also had a finger torn off, broke his left leg and took shrapnel in his groin and arms. ''He was rushing to save me, because I made a stupid mistake,'' the sergeant said, ''and then got hurt worse than me.'' The two men, who were good friends at Camp Pendleton, where they often took 10-mile hikes together, have made a pact to encourage each other through recovery. First Lt. Jim Hutchinson, 25, a Marine platoon commander, remembers hearing the explosion and feeling his body being flung through the air as the sounds of gunshots resounded in every direction. After landing, he checked his body and arose and ran, ordering his men to find cover. What he did not realize until his legs buckled several seconds later was that shrapnel had ripped through his hands and legs. ''I was just running on adrenalin,'' said the lieutenant, whose platoon was part of an engineering battalion based at Camp Lejeune, N.C., that came under fire on March 27 after having destroyed crates of rocket-propelled grenades on the outskirts of Nasiriya. In all, 30 marines with his platoon were wounded that day. ''I feel awful that I'm back here,'' said Lieutenant Hutchinson, who wonders whether there was more that he could have done for his men. ''It's not right for a platoon commander to be away from his marines.'' Early this week, Corporal Klingel was given a plane ticket, courtesy of a Navy charity, to fly to Harrisville Township, Ohio, to rest at his parents' house. He said he hoped that the nightmares would fade, but feared that he would have to live with them for a long time. ''The firefight scared the hell out of me,'' he said. ''But this -- moving forward -- is just as scary.'' After mentioning how much he looked forward to standing out on his parents' porch and staring into the wilderness, he added: ''I am still looking over my shoulder. I am sure I will be standing on the back porch and worry about who might come shooting at me out of the bush. It's changed me.'' A NATION AT WAR: VETERANS Correction: May 11, 2003, Sunday CORRECTING THE RECORD; The Articles; Witnesses and Documents Unveil Deceptions In a Reporter's Work On Sunday, May 11, 2003, The Times published a two-full-page accounting of misrepresentations and plagiarism by Jayson Blair, who resigned on May 1 as a reporter. This article was among those described. The description: In Military Wards, Questions And Fears From the Wounded APRIL 19, 2003 WHEREABOUTS -- The scenes described in the article took place ostensibly inside a ward of the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. But Lt. Cmdr. Jerry Rostad, the public affairs officer for the center, said there was no record that Mr. Blair had visited or interviewed patients there. DENIED REPORTS -- Of the six wounded soldiers quoted in what Mr. Blair described as ''long conversations'' at the medical center, one, Lance Cpl. James Klingel, said he was interviewed by Mr. Blair, but by telephone from his home in Lodi, Ohio, after he had been discharged. Telephone records described by Times officials suggest that Mr. Blair made this 27-minute call from his desk at the paper in New York on April 17. Three men -- Staff Sgt. Eric Alva, Lt. Col. Jonathan Ewers and Hospitalman Brian Alaniz -- said they had not spoken to Mr. Blair, Commander Rostad said. (Two others could not be reached.) In a telephone interview, Corporal Klingel said that Mr. Blair had manufactured or embellished parts of the article. He said that, for example, the following quotation attributed to him by Mr. Blair had been made up: ''I am still looking over my shoulder. I am sure I will be standing on the back porch and worry about who might come shooting at me out of the bush.'' Corporal Klingel also disputed the portion of the article that described him as ''disheartened because he will most likely limp the rest of his life and need to use a cane.'' He said he was neither limping nor using a cane now. In addition, he denied he had told Mr. Blair he was having nightmares about his tour in Iraq. And he said he had not spoken to Mr. Blair about ''his mind wandering from images of his girlfriend back in Ohio to the sight of an exploding fireball to the sounds of twisting metal,'' as Mr. Blair described. Because he interviewed Corporal Klingel by phone, Mr. Blair was not in a position to describe him as he did in his article: speaking from a hospital bed and contemplating a visit to a chaplain, as Sergeant Alva lay in the bed next to him. Reached by phone, Sergeant Alva's mother, Lois, declined to comment. But Commander Rostad said that Sergeant Alva contended that he did not say any of the comments attributed to him by Mr. Blair. These included the following: ''But in more private moments last week in the hospital, Sergeant Alva acknowledged that he had anger that he directed inward and toward the news media that he said were too hard on soldiers and a public that he said did not really understand the costs of war. 'There is no point in explaining how I feel,' he said, 'because no one really is going to be able to understand it.' '' Later in the article, Mr. Blair wrote: ''Sergeant Alva, who has had 10 operations since stepping on the mine on March 22, blames himself for the injuries of Seaman Alaniz, who is 28. If he had not been dumb enough to step on the mine, Sergeant Alva concluded, his friend would have never been injured.'' FACTUAL ERRORS -- Mr. Blair erroneously described Hospitalman Alaniz as a seaman and as being ''down the hall'' from Sergeant Alva and Corporal Klingel at the medical center. Hospitalman Alaniz was discharged on April 9, five days before Corporal Klingel's arrival, Commander Rostad said. In addition, the article stated that Sergeant Alva had lost his right leg; his right leg had been amputated below the knee.

"Federal investigators say a commercial tenant and the city share responsibility for an explosion that ripped apart a Chelsea loft building last spring, injuring dozens of people and rattling New Yorkers already jittery since the Sept. 11 terror attack. The tenant, a sign-making company, stored and mixed hazardous chemicals in the basement without adequate safety training for its workers and also without the proper permits, and the city monitored that chemical inventory poorly, investigators say. Officials at the United States Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board said the blast, on the morning of April 25, 2002, probably occurred when a container of nitric acid, a highly volatile compound left over from a previous manufacturing operation, was poured into a 55-gallon drum into which workers had been dumping various chemicals, including lacquer thinner. ''It was a real witch's brew,'' said Stephen Selk, the lead investigator for the chemical board, an independent federal agency that will issue its preliminary report on the explosion today. Things happened fast after the chemicals were mixed, according to the report. The drum began hissing and the workers for the company, Kaltech Industries Group, ran. A few seconds later, the drum exploded, blasting up from the basement through the stairwells and elevator shafts of the 11-story building at 111-121 West 19th Street, blowing out windows and doors and sending debris and glass flying into the street from a hole in the facade. At least 42 people were injured, 12 of them critically. The initial fear that terrorists might have attacked New York City again was ruled out immediately by government officials, but Mr. Selk said the investigation uncovered a practice that would hardly reassure residents and workers in the area: chemicals with potentially devastating reactive qualities were being casually handled by mostly untrained workers in the middle of the most dense urban corridor in the nation, even as the typical bustle of a Manhattan weekday unfolded just outside the company's doors. ''A lot of folks dropped the ball,'' Mr. Selk said. ''The business wasn't doing all the right things, but I also think the city should look at its fire code and ask some hard questions.'' In some ways, the preliminary report says, New York was lucky. Many of the chemicals in the basement were highly flammable, and at least one, methylene chloride -- a paint remover listed by the Environmental Protection Agency as a probable human carcinogen -- was nearby when the blast occurred. A container of alcohol was apparently knocked over by the explosion, and was probably then ignited by the company's electrical system, which the report said was inappropriate for use in a chemical storage environment. A potentially catastrophic chemical fire was averted only because the flames were quickly extinguished by the building's sprinklers. Kaltech had city permits to store 1,000 gallons of paint and 550 gallons of solvent on the premises. But Mr. Selk said the owners told the investigating team that they were unaware of the requirement to report many of chemicals routinely kept on hand, and kept little paperwork. Government safety inspections, especially to the building's basement storage area, also appeared to be rare or nonexistent. Chemical board investigators said the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration had not visited Kaltech in at least 10 years, and that New York City fire officials had gone there as part of the permit-issuing procedure, but apparently never went to the basement. The report also found shortcomings in how the city distributes the information that it does collect. Kaltech reported some of its chemical inventory to the city's Department of Environmental Protection, and under the city's rules, Mr. Selk said, that information was forwarded to the Fire Department. But Kaltech's list of chemicals apparently never made it to the department's Bureau of Fire Prevention, which might have raised questions. In any case, environmental protection officials concluded after the blast that the information Kaltech had filed was incomplete or inconsistent with the basement inventory, a spokesman for the department said. A spokesman for the Fire Department, David Billig, said yesterday that fire marshals had also determined that the cause of the blast was the mixing of incompatible chemicals. He added that the department was still looking into other issues raised by the report. Repeated calls to the owners of Kaltech were not returned. Officials at the chemical safety board also stressed that their findings were preliminary. A public meeting on the investigation is to be held today in Manhattan, and representatives of the Fire Department, the Department of Environmental Protection and the City Department of Buildings are scheduled to testify. The meeting is scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. at the Fashion Institute of Technology. Other investigations are also still proceeding. A spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney's office, Barbara Thompson, said lawyers there were still looking into the blast to determine whether criminal charges were appropriate."
"For decades, scholars have debated whether the eruption of the Thera volcano in the Aegean more than 3,000 years ago brought about the mysterious collapse of Minoan civilization at the peak of its glory. The volcanic isle (whose remnants are known as Santorini) lay just 70 miles from Minoan Crete, so it seemed quite reasonable that its fury could have accounted for the fall of that celebrated people. This idea suffered a blow in 1987 when Danish scientists studying cores from the Greenland icecap reported evidence that Thera exploded in 1645 B.C., some 150 years before the usual date. That put so much time between the natural disaster and the Minoan decline that the linkage came to be widely doubted, seeming far-fetched at best. Now, scientists at Columbia University, the University of Hawaii and other institutions are renewing the proposed connection. New findings, they say, show that Thera's upheaval was far more violent than previously calculated -- many times larger than the 1883 Krakatoa eruption, which killed more than 36,000 people. They say the Thera blast's cultural repercussions were equally large, rippling across the eastern Mediterranean for decades, even centuries. ''It had to have had a huge impact,'' said Dr. Floyd W. McCoy, a University of Hawaii geologist who has studied the eruption for decades and recently proposed that it was much more violent than previously thought. The scientists say Thera's outburst produced deadly waves and dense clouds of volcanic ash over a vast region, crippling ancient cities and fleets, setting off climate changes, ruining crops and sowing wide political unrest. For Minoan Crete, the scientists see direct and indirect consequences. Dr. McCoy discovered that towering waves from the eruption that hit Crete were up to 50 feet high, smashing ports and fleets and severely damaging the maritime economy. Other scientists found indirect, long-term damage. Ash and global cooling from the volcanic pall caused wide crop failures in the eastern Mediterranean, they said, and the agricultural woes in turn set off political upheavals that undid Minoan friends and trade. ''Imagine island states without links to the outside world,'' Dr. William B. F. Ryan, a geologist at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union. Scientists who link Thera to the Minoan decline say the evidence is still emerging and in some cases sketchy. Even so, they say it is already compelling enough to have convinced many archaeologists, geologists and historians that the repercussions probably amounted to a death blow for Minoan Crete. Rich and sensual, sophisticated and artistic, Minoan culture flourished in the Bronze Age between roughly 3000 and 1400 B.C., the first high civilization of Europe. It developed an early form of writing and used maritime skill to found colonies and a trade empire. The British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans called the civilization Minoan, after Minos, the legendary king. His unearthed palace was huge and intricate, and had clearly been weakened by many upheavals, including fire and earthquakes. Nearby on the volcanic island of Thera, or Santorini, archaeologists dug up Minoan buildings, artifacts and a whole city, Akrotiri, buried under volcanic ash like Pompeii. Some of its beautifully preserved frescoes depicted Egyptian motifs and animals, suggesting significant contact between the two peoples. In 1939, Spyridon Marinatos, a Greek archaeologist, proposed that the eruption wrecked Minoan culture on Thera and Crete. He envisioned the damage as done by associated earthquakes and tsunamis. While geologists found tsunamis credible, they doubted the destructive power of Thera's earthquakes, saying volcanic ones tend to be relatively mild. The debate simmered for decades. In the mid-1960's, scientists dredging up ooze from the bottom of the Mediterranean began to notice a thick layer of ash that they linked to Thera's eruption. They tracked it over thousands of square miles. Dr. McCoy of the University of Hawaii, then at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute on Cape Cod, took part in these discoveries, starting a lifelong interest in Thera. By the early 1980's, he was publishing papers on the ash distribution. Such clues helped geologists estimate the amount of material Thera spewed into the sky and the height of its eruption cloud -- main factors in the Volcanic Explosivity Index. Its scale goes from zero to eight and is logarithmic, so each unit represents a tenfold increase in explosive power. Thera was given a V.E.I. of 6.0, on a par with Krakatoa in 1883. The similarity to Krakatoa, which lies between Sumatra and Java, helped experts better envision Thera's wrath. Krakatoa hurled rock and ash more than 20 miles high and its blasts could be heard 3,000 miles away. Its giant waves killed thousands of people. Despite the power of Thera, the Danish scientists' evidence raised doubts about its links to the Minoan decline. Their date for Thera's explosion, 1645 B.C., based on frozen ash in Greenland, is some 150 years earlier than the usual date. Given that the Minoan fall was usually dated to 1450 B.C., the gap between cause and effect seemed too large. Another blow landed in 1989 when scholars on Crete found, above a Thera ash layer, a house that had been substantially rebuilt in the Minoan style. It suggested at least partial cultural survival. By 1996, experts like Prof. Jeremy B. Rutter, head of classics at Dartmouth, judged the chronological gap too extreme for any linkage. ''No direct correlation can be established'' between the volcano and the Minoan decline, he concluded. As doubts rose about this linkage, scientists found more evidence suggesting that Thera's eruption had been unusually violent and disruptive over wide areas. Scientific maps drawn in the 1960's and 1970's showed its ash as falling mostly over nearby waters and Aegean islands. By the 1990's, however, the affected areas had been found to include lands of the eastern Mediterranean from Anatolia to Egypt. Scientists found ash from Thera at the bottom of the Black Sea and Nile delta. Dr. Peter I. Kuniholm, an expert at Cornell on using tree rings to establish dates, found ancient trees in a burial mound in Anatolia, what now is in the Asian part of Turkey. For half a decade those trees had grown three times as fast as normal -- apparently because Thera's volcanic pall turned hot, dry summers into seasons that were unusually cool and wet. ''We've got an anomaly, the biggest in the past 9,000 years,'' Dr. Kuniholm said in an interview. More intrigued than ever, Dr. McCoy of the University of Hawaii two years ago stumbled on more evidence suggesting that Thera's ash fall had been unusually wide and heavy. During a field trip to Anafi, an island some 20 miles east of Thera, he found to his delight that the authorities had just cut fresh roads that exposed layers of Thera ash up to 10 feet thick -- a surprising amount that distance from the eruption. And Greek colleagues showed him new seabed samples taken off the Greek mainland, suggesting that more ash blew westward than scientists had realized. Factoring in such evidence, Dr. McCoy calculated that Thera had a V.E.I. of 7.0 -- what geologists call colossal and exceedingly rare. In the past 10,000 years only one other volcano has exploded with that kind of gargantuan violence: Tambora, in Indonesia, in 1816, It produced an ash cloud in the upper atmosphere that reflected sunlight back into space and produced the year without a summer. The cold led to ruinous harvests, hunger and even famine in the United States, Europe and Russia. ''I presented this evidence last summer at a meeting,'' Dr. McCoy recalled, ''and the comment from the other volcanologists was, 'Hey, it was probably larger than Tambora.' '' Dr. Ryan of Columbia has woven such clues into a tantalizing but provisional theory on how distant effects might have slowly undone Crete. First, he noted that winds at low and high altitudes seem to have blown Thera's ash into distinct plumes -- one to the southeast, toward Egypt and another heavier one to the northeast, toward Anatolia. Even if the changes wrought by Thera helped trees there, they apparently played havoc with delicate wheat fields. Mursilis, a king of the Hittites, set out from Anatolia on a rampage, traveling between the plumes to strike Syria and Babylon and seize their stored grains and cereals. The subsequent collapse of Babylon into a dark age, Dr. Ryan said, also undid one of its puppets, the Hyksos, foreigners who ruled Egypt and traded with the Minoans. He theorized that the new Egyptian dynasty had no love of Hyksos allies. So Minoan Crete, already reeling from Thera's fury, suffered new blows to its maritime trade. In an interview, Dr. Ryan said he and other scholars were still refining dates on some of the ancient events, promising to better fix their relation to the eruption. The outcome of that work, he said, could either strengthen or undermine his thesis. Even without such distant upsets, some prominent archaeologists have concluded that the volcano's long-term repercussions meant the end of Minoan Crete. For instance, they argue that the revolt of nature over the predictable certainties of Minoan religion probably crippled the authority of the priestly ruling class, weakening its hold on society. In scholarly articles, Dr. Jan Driessen, an archaeologist at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, and Dr. Colin F. MacDonald, an archaeologist at the British School in Athens, have argued that changes to Cretan architecture, storage, food production, artistic output and the distribution of riches imply major social dislocations, and perhaps civil war. By 1450 B.C., Mycenaean invaders from mainland Greece seized control of Crete, ending the Minoan era. Thera's destructiveness was probably the catalyst, Dr. Driessen and Dr. MacDonald wrote, ''that culminated in Crete being absorbed to a greater or lesser extent into the Mycenaean, and therefore, the Greek world.''"
"Three manhole covers exploded into the air yesterday morning on a residential block in central Queens, injuring no one but shattering glass in apartment buildings as high as the 19th floor and jolting residents who feared a terrorist attack. The simultaneous explosions were caused by fires in electrical cables under the street, and took place about 8 a.m. on 83rd Avenue in Kew Gardens, said Brenda Perez, a spokeswoman for Consolidated Edison. The block, just south of Queens Boulevard, would have been crowded with people going to work and children bound for a nearby elementary school if not for the federal holiday, several people said. After the blasts, dozens of bleary-eyed people staggered outside to see thick white smoke dissipating and pavements littered with shards of hot metal and broken glass. To their amazement, there were no people. ''It's a miracle no one was hurt,'' said Elaine LeGaro, an actress who lives on the second floor of a building that sits next to one of the manholes. Like many others, she was asleep when she heard the blast. Throwing on some clothing, she ran downstairs to find a scene of panic and commotion in the lobby. The glass doors and windows on the first floor of her building had been shattered, she said, and there was a strong smell, like cooking gas, in the air. Helicopters began circling overhead, and she wondered for a moment if the city was under attack. Across the street, Lee Bollinger was eating breakfast when a terrific boom rang out and the whole building seemed to shake. ''Right away I went out on the balcony and looked to see if a plane had hit the building,'' he said. ''I thought it was a terrorist thing.'' Glenn Burke, the superintendent at 123-33 83rd Avenue, which suffered the most damage, said that 50 to 100 windows and some glass doors had been broken The blast did not cause any power failures, Ms. Perez said, and no one had to be evacuated. Sol Hochberg, 82, watching Con Edison workers cleaning up, said the blast was a good lesson. ''I know what it sounds like in Iraq now,'' he said."
"At least 14 people were killed in several explosions tonight in Casablanca, Morocco, as attackers used car bombs and detonated another device to strike Jewish, Spanish and Belgian targets, according to Morocco's state news agency. The interior minister, Mostafa Sahel, told reporters overnight in Casablanca that the attacks ''bear the hallmark of international terrorism.'' Mr. Sahel said 10 suicide bombers were also killed. He added that 60 other people had been injured. The attacks, scattered across several parts of the city, appeared to have been coordinated, and they came at a time when American officials and others were expressing increasing concern about the prospect of a new wave of terrorism. They followed the car-bomb attacks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Monday night, that killed 34 people, 8 of them Americans. American intelligence officials said tonight that it was too early to determine who was behind the bombings, but the fact that they came so soon after the Saudi attack led them to suspect Al Qaeda. The officials said there were no known American dead. Reports from Casablanca, the Atlantic Ocean port city that is Morocco's commercial capital, described scenes of carnage near a Spanish cultural center, the Belgian Consulate, a Jewish community center and the Farah Maghreb Hotel, formerly known as the Hotel Safir, where the bombs began to explode about 9:20 p.m. local time. ''There are body parts all over the place,'' a Moroccan journalist told the BBC, describing an eyewitness account from the Spanish cultural center. Those who died included two Moroccan police officers and a security guard at the Spanish cultural center, according to the official Map news agency. The Moroccan agency said three suspects had been arrested, but it gave no immediate details. It said King Mohammed VI was being kept informed and had ''ordered a system for evacuating the injured to be put in place.'' Witnesses told Agence France-Presse that most of the casualties had occurred at the Jewish Alliance Club. The French news agency reported that a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance of the Farah Maghreb Hotel when a hotel porter would not let him in. The French agency said two suicide bombers' bodies had been recovered from ruins at the Jewish center. The Belgian Consulate is near the United States Consulate, but American officials in Washington said that it had not been a target. A State Department spokeswoman, Joanne Moore, said no United States government building had been hit. A duty officer at the Pentagon said there was no indication that the attacks had been aimed at the United States military. American officials had spoken for several days of growing but inconclusive indications picked up through intelligence channels that a terrorist attack might be imminent. The officials had said their concerns focused on the Middle East, East Africa and Asia, and they had gone so far as to issue warnings about Kenya, Malaysia and a specific neighborhood in Jidda, Saudi Arabia. But they had not issued any specific warnings about Morocco. Al Qaeda, the terrorist organization seen as the most likely culprit in the Saudi blasts, has made a specialty of staging coordinated, near-simultaneous attacks, like the bombings in 1998 of American embassies in East Africa and the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. In May and June last year, Morocco arrested three Saudis and seven Moroccans suspected of having links to Al Qaeda. The suspects were accused of plotting to attack American and British warships crossing the Strait of Gibraltar, and of planning attacks on tourist sites in Morocco. The Moroccan authorities have tried to keep a tight lid on the activities of militants within the kingdom. In August of last year, they arrested 30 Muslim radicals and charged them with the killing of several Moroccans. According to the Moroccan news agency, three of the blasts were car bombs, which struck the Belgian Consulate, the Jewish center and the Farah Maghreb Hotel, located in the heart of the city in an area crowded with hotels and restaurants. The fourth explosion, near the Spanish cultural center, was apparently caused by a bomb that was not in a car, the news agency said. Moroccan journalists quoted by Reuters said the blast at the hotel, which they said had killed at least eight people, may have been aimed at a nearby Jewish restaurant. Radical Muslim groups have condemned the Moroccan government for its close cooperation with Washington's campaign against terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States. Some of the Qaeda and Taliban members captured by United States forces in Afghanistan are known to have been turned over to Moroccan authorities for questioning. A largely moderate Muslim country in North Africa, Morocco was one of the first countries in the Arab world to establish relations with Israel. It is home to a significant Jewish community that numbers several thousand people. The United States and Morocco are expected to sign a free-trade agreement by the end of 2003, and Moroccan leaders have pointed to the deal as a reason for companies to base their Middle East operations in the country. In addition to the new terror warnings from the United States in the last few days concerning Kenya, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, the British government on Thursday ordered a halt to airline flights to and from Kenya, and the Kenyan government said today that there had been a specific Qaeda threat to British Airways planes flying into Nairobi. Britain later warned its citizens of a ''clear terrorist threat'' in six neighboring East African countries. Today, President Bush told reporters that the attacks in Saudi Arabia had served notice to the world that there were killers on the loose. ''It's dangerous in the world, and it's dangerous inside Saudi Arabia, and it's dangerous so long as Al Qaeda continues to operate,'' Mr. Bush said. AFTEREFFECTS: MOROCCO"
"A truck loaded with explosives blew up near a government complex in northern Chechnya today in what officials said was a suicidal terrorist attack. The blast killed at least 41 people and wounded scores more, many of them gravely, in a region that had until now escaped the worst of Russia's war against Chechen separatists. The attack today was the worst convulsion of violence in Chechnya since Russia held a constitutional referendum there in March as part of the Kremlin's efforts to hasten a peaceful end to the war after 44 months of violent conflict. Officials said the death toll -- already among the worst single attacks in the war -- could rise still higher. None of Chechnya's known separatist groups claimed responsibility for the attack, but President Vladimir V. Putin, meeting with his cabinet at the Kremlin shortly afterward, said the attack was intended to disrupt efforts to foster some sort of stability in Chechnya under a loose political federation with Russia. ''All similar actions are aimed at only one thing: to stop the process of settlement in Chechnya, to stop the process of a political settlement,'' Mr. Putin told cabinet members in remarks broadcast on television. ''We cannot allow anything like that, and we shall not allow it.'' The attack occurred just after 10 a.m. when the truck -- with one and perhaps two or three apparent suicide bombers -- approached a compound of government buildings in the town of Znamenskoye, along the Terek River near Chechnya's border with the Stavropol region. It exploded, perhaps prematurely, after ramming a steel barricade outside the compound, witnesses told Russian news agencies. The force of the blast, estimated to come from the equivalent of a ton of TNT, gouged a gaping crater more than 30 feet wide and some 20 feet deep in the road and damaged the headquarters of the regional government, as well as offices of the Interior Ministry and the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., which oversees the campaign against Chechnya's separatists. Although the attack appeared directed at the government buildings, the truck exploded in a residential neighborhood nearby, obliterating several kiosks and homes. Video broadcast on Russian television showed shattered hulks of buildings, broken beams and masonry and mangled mounds of earth, debris and bloodied cloth. In an interview on NTV, Ruslan Daurov, who was inside one of the government buildings, described a hail of shattered glass. ''Everything was flowing around us,'' he said, his head wrapped in a bloodied bandage. ''Shouts and moans -- very many women were injured.'' Sultan M. Akhmetkhanov, the head of the administrative district, said in a telephone interview that at least four homes were completely destroyed and others were badly damaged. He said rescuers were searching through the rubble for those who might have been trapped inside. A spokesman for Mr. Akhmetkhanov, reached by telephone tonight, said that 41 people had been confirmed dead, including at least 6 children. In all, 269 people were reported injured; 111 were hospitalized, 57 of them in critical condition. Nikolai P. Patrushev, the director of the F.S.B., the K.G.B.'s successor, said the truck exploded after stopping at a checkpoint, about 100 feet from a concrete wall surrounding the compound. Some news reports said security forces opened fire on the truck, but Sultan S. Makhtiyev, the deputy head of the district administration, said in a telephone interview that no one had time to try to stop it before it exploded. Mr. Patrushev, speaking in the meeting with Mr. Putin, said that police and security officers were among those killed, but that most of those killed or wounded were civilians. Interfax reported that the local F.S.B. director, Col. Mairbek Khusiyev, had suffered a concussion. The attack today was the latest to undercut the Kremlin's claims to have largely restored order to the republic, where separatists have struggled to establish an independent republic ever since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Russian forces invaded in 1994 to crush the separatist movement, withdrew in 1996 in humiliating defeat and invaded again in 1999. Unable anymore to confront the Russians, the separatists, many of them Islamic fundamentalists, are waging a campaign using increasingly audacious terrorist tactics that have been seen as a sign of the rebels' desperation. In October, Chechen guerrillas seized a Moscow theater and held nearly 800 people hostage for 57 hours. At least 41 guerrillas died, as well as at least 129 hostages, most of them from nerve gas used by Russian commandos in the raid that ended the crisis. In December, suicide bombers detonated two truck bombs outside the headquarters of Chechnya's pro-Moscow administration in Grozny, the Chechen capital, in circumstances strikingly similar to the attack today, killing more than 70. Last month, an explosion killed at least 16 people aboard a bus in an attack that was videotaped and shown on a rebel Web site. The Web site claimed 17 Russian and Chechen police officers had been killed, but Russian officials said the victims were civilians. Just last Friday, a bomb evidently fashioned from an artillery shell exploded outside Grozny's stadium before a military parade commemorating Victory Day, the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany. One policeman died and two others were wounded. The head of the pro-Moscow government in Chechnya, Akhmad Kadyrov, blamed the attack today on rebels under Aslan Maskhadov, the separatist leader -- a claim that a spokesman for Mr. Maskhadov denied in an interview with Ekho Moskvy radio. Mr. Kadyrov, who often clashes with Russian officials, also pointedly questioned the ability of Russian forces to provide sufficient security. ''Where did this car with explosives come from?'' he said to Interfax. ''How did it get to Znamenskoye? I have many questions.''"
"Four crew members were killed and at least 17 others were injured this morning in an explosion and fire in a boiler room of the Norway, a cruise ship that had just docked in Miami after a week in the Caribbean, rescue officials said. None of the 2,135 passengers aboard the ship, owned by Norwegian Cruise Lines, were injured and all were evacuated without incident, the officials said. The Miami-Dade police said the explosion did not appear to be a terrorist act. ''There is no indication whatsoever of any criminal activity,'' Police Director Carlos Alvarez said. ''At this time, it appears to be a very tragic accident.'' Fifteen injured crew members were taken to nearby Jackson Memorial Hospital after the blast, which occurred about 6:30 a.m., nearly two hours after the 41-year-old ship pulled into port, the Coast Guard said. ''All are burn victims with varying degrees of burns,'' said Conchita Ruiz-Topinka, a hospital spokeswoman. ''Eight of those were pretty bad burns.'' The cruise line, the Coast Guard and the hospital said they had no further information on the identities, nationality or sex of the dead and injured, part of a crew of about 900. ''We're trying to identify them,'' Ms. Ruiz-Topinka said. More than 100 police officers and more than 100 firefighters from Miami and Miami Beach were dispatched to the port to help evacuate the passengers and crew and treat the injured. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team to investigate. ''It was the steam line that blew,'' Petty Officer Roger Krass of the Coast Guard said this evening in Miami. ''It is still under investigation as to the exact cause.'' Norwegian Cruise Line issued a statement saying that the company was ''deeply saddened by the deaths'' and announcing that it was canceling the next scheduled cruise of the Norway, scheduled for this afternoon. Each passenger on the canceled cruise will receive a refund and a credit of equal value for a future cruise, the statement said. Most passengers were asleep when the Norway docked at the Port of Miami around 4:30 a.m. Passengers reported being awakened by the explosion or by an announcement over the ship's public address system ordering them to report to emergency evacuation stations. ''I was sleeping and I jumped out of bed,'' said Connie McGuire of Indianapolis, who was traveling with her husband, Everett, and their son and daughter-in-law. ''All the lights went out and the air went off,'' she said. Mr. McGuire said: ''We felt it, we heard it. It was pitch-black in our room. Our room service guy was banging on our door saying everyone needed to go up to their stations.'' Rich and Gail Zwakenberg of Reno, Nev., heard a loud thump in their cabin. ''It sounded like the ship had hit the pier,'' Ms. Zwakenberg said. She said that when she reached the evacuation station, another passenger reported having seen a man on fire, his skin melting from his body. ''That definitely shook me up,'' Ms. Zwakenberg said. Mr. Zwakenberg said passengers were quickly taken off the ship. ''They had three gangways open, so people were able to leave the ship rather quickly.'' After he debarked, Mr. Zwakenberg turned to notice a huge, steady plume of smoke billowing from the ship. ''It's amazing that something can happen so fast like that,'' he said. The fleeing passengers did not have to go through standard immigration procedures, Mr. Zwakenberg said. Instead, they were told that their luggage would be delivered to their homes. Two years ago, Norwegian Cruise Line was forced to cancel a Norway cruise after the Coast Guard found more than 100 safety violations during an inspection, including numerous leaks in the ship's sprinkler system. Petty Officer Burns said that in the last inspection of the ship, on May 15, ''no discrepancies'' were reported. Last year, Norwegian Cruise Line was part of a crackdown on cruise ship pollution when it and the three other large cruise lines pleaded guilty to intentionally polluting the waters in which they operated. Norwegian agreed to pay a $1 million fine after acknowledging that it had dumped oil overboard and falsified its records to conceal the pollution. An employee at Norwegian said that spokesmen for the company were unavailable for comment during the holiday weekend. The National Transportation Safety Board has for years had concerns about fire safety standards on cruise ships. The agency has recommended some changes to alarm and other fire safety systems on the ships in recent years in response to fires on cruise line ships in the 1990's. But a spokesman for the agency said today that he was unsure of how many of the upgrades had been made and on how many ships. ''There had been some recommendations that came out of it,'' said Ted Lopatkiewitz, a spokesman for the safety board. ''I don't know if any individual lines are actually doing it,'' he added, referring to implementing the recommendations. As for the Norway, many passengers showed up at the port this afternoon for its next sail not knowing that their cruise had been canceled. One woman who was planning to sail the Norway today said that Norwegian crew members seemed reluctant to say what was happening. ''The first lady we found said she couldn't tell us what happened,'' said Beth Goble of Colorado Springs, who was planning to sail with eight relatives and friends. ''We were all spread out trying to figure out what was going on. The second lady we talked to told us that something in the boiler room happened and the ship would not be sailing this week.'' Ms. Goble added: ''We started working on this trip in January and spent a month and a half coordinating everything, but I guess it wasn't meant to be.'' Correction: May 27, 2003, Tuesday A picture of the soot-covered deck of the cruise ship Norway yesterday with an article about an explosion on board carried an incorrect credit in some copies. It was by Getty Images, not Reuters. Correction: May 30, 2003, Friday An article on Monday about an explosion on the cruise ship Norway misspelled the surname of a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board and misstated the context for a remark about shipboard changes that have resulted from the agency's recommendations. He is Ted Lopatkiewicz, not Lopatkiewitz. His comment, ''I don't know if any individual lines are actually doing it,'' referred to installing local-sounding fire alarms, not to carrying out the recommendations in general."
"More than 20,000 visitors are expected for commencement ceremonies today at Yale University, where they will be greeted by bomb-sniffing dogs and other security measures days after a bomb exploded at the law school. As they prepared to collect their diplomas, graduates did not seem to be worried about a repeat of Wednesday's blast, which left heavy damage in some classrooms and a nearby lounge. In a memo posted on the university's Web site, school officials said they would be ''taking some special security measures'' and that ''backpacks, camera bags or any other large bag will not be permitted'' at the commencement. There will also be screening at the entrance of Old Campus, the historic center of the school, where the main commencement ceremonies will be held. Officers from the state police and the New Haven Police Department will patrol the area along with university police. The law school's diploma ceremony is also scheduled for today, though some areas near the bombing site may be off-limits. Yesterday, the law school was closed to the public, but students were allowed to enter with police escorts. Cleaning crews spent part of the day picking up trash, washing windows and preparing for the ceremonies. Seniors gathered yesterday to celebrate traditional Class Day activities, including an address by Thomas L. Friedman, a columnist for The New York Times. The United States attorney's office said the investigation into the bombing was continuing."
"The children followed the British tanks around the corner and into a part of town once forbidden to them, the local headquarters for the fedayeen guerrilla units called Saddam's Martyrs. As the tanks continued on their way one afternoon last week, trailing a cloud of dust, one of the children picked up a grenade that was lying on the ground and playfully tossed it into the air. ''It exploded on us,'' recalled Hashem Shaalan, 9, from his hospital bed. With a fractured skull and injured arm, he lay bandaged and spoke in a whisper. ''The minute it hit me, it felt like electricity and then I don't know what happened.'' Hashem was one of three children wounded that day and among the dozens who have been hurt since the start of the war by playing with the discarded weapons and unexploded ordinances from secret caches hidden in crumbling buildings all over Iraq's second largest city. ''We see a lot of children like this,'' Dr. Abdullah Fadl, the general surgeon at what used to be called Saddam Hospital in Basra -- now renamed after the part of town it is in. In Basra, as in much of the rest of the country, the large quantities of weapons scattered about are one more danger facing the children. British soldiers stationed here say they collect the weapons when they find them and store them in guarded sites. One person familiar with the British Army's handling of the weapons said the guards had to shoot at, on average, a half dozen people trying to get into the sites each night. While aid workers say that mines and unexploded ordnance are the biggest danger to children in other war zones, in Basra the large caches of weapons hidden by the Iraqi Army and security forces seem to be the major problem. Although some children here have started going to school again, many, particularly in the poorer sections of the city, returned to find no desks, no paper and no pens. Everything had been stolen by looters. So the children remain on the streets. There are no authorities to keep the children in line and no distractions to keep them amused. Even the British soldiers do not venture into some parts of town because the streets are too narrow for armored personnel carriers and too dangerous for foot patrols, soldiers say. ''This is no place to be a child,'' said Karima Shaalan, Hashem's mother. For Ms. Shaalan, life has been hard for a long time. In 1992 her husband, Shaalan Mashkoor, was arrested by the secret police, said friends who saw it happen. She never found out why. ''He had gone to the market with 17,000 dinars to buy a car, and he never returned,'' she said. She does not know if he is alive or dead. ''I had to raise our three boys,'' she said. To make money, she was forced to sell cigarettes. Her family had to crowd into a small apartment with about a dozen other people. Over the next few years, as the Baath Party brutally oppressed the people here out of fear that they would rebel, she was arrested twice. ''Somebody from the party was killed and they blamed me,'' she said, of her first arrest, saying that her family had become targets because someone in the party apparently did not like her husband. She was kept in prison for five months. Life for some in Basra has been improving since the fighting largely ended a month ago. The streets are now generally safe during the daytime and electricity has been restored to parts of town. But residents said the continuing lack of order had brought new hardships. In the poor sections of the city, they said, there are still nightly shootings and random attacks. ''Every night explosions are happening,'' said Adel Abu Hashim, who lives near Ms. Shaalan. He said he was driving his car on the day Hashem was hurt when he heard a boom. ''I went over to where I heard the noise and I found the children there, laying on the ground, bleeding,'' he said. He scooped them into his car and raced to the hospital. Only Hashem, the most seriously wounded, was admitted. The fedayeen headquarters, where the explosion took place, remains unguarded, with several families who had been forced from their homes squatting in the wreckage. One day last week, three grenades with pins still in them as well as scattered unexploded munitions lay on the ground. Dozens of children raced around, picking up anything shiny. Mr. Hashim said the fedayeen would behead men with swords and then toss the bodies into underground tunnels. He said the rooms were booby trapped with explosives. Saja Hadi, 12, watched as the young boys tried to show off for visitors by holding up abandoned weapons. Saja lives in the compound with her mother, Inam Ali Abbas. ''We have been here for a week,'' Saja said quietly. She was not sure what the compound had been used for in the past but she knew it was a scary place where bad things happened. As a young boy tossed artillery rounds into the dirt, she said, ''I don't like to play with those things.'' AFTEREFFECTS: SOUTHERN IRAQ"
"It may look like the gasp of a fireworks display, and it was formed by one very big bang. But what this picture really shows is how far from empty outer space is. Taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, the picture is of a supernova remnant called N49 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a small galaxy about 160,000 light-years away. It was created when a massive star exploded in a blast whose light reached the Earth thousands of years ago. But the delicate shapes don't just represent the explosion. They were formed when material ejected from the star hit a molecular cloud, an area of cold, dense interstellar material, said Dr. You-Hua Chu, an astronomer at the University of Illinois who is a leader of the research project for which the picture was taken. ''When the ejecta hits the molecular cloud, the lumpy stuff in the clouds gets smashed into sheets that appear as long filaments,'' Dr. Chu said. The blue lines show the shock waves from the initial impact, while the red and yellow give clues to the structure of the resulting remnant -- the goal of the research. But Dr. Chu acknowledged that this was not why NASA had released the photo to be timed to the Fourth of July. ''It's such a pretty picture,'' she said. SPACE SHOTS"
"An explosion occurred Thursday night along a major oil pipeline route in north-central Iraq and appears to have been an act of sabotage, according to a top Iraqi oil official. ''This is the first time we managed to know that it is sabotage,'' said Adel Qazzaz, the director general of Iraq's Northern Oil Company, which manages oil production in the large Kirkuk field. ''There have been fires before, but we thought those were because of seepage from old pipes.'' Reached by phone in Kirkuk, Mr. Qazzaz said he was informed this morning by colleagues in Beiji, an oil refining center about halfway between Kirkuk and Baghdad, that an attack on a pipeline route had touched off an explosion. Three pipelines were affected, he said, and a fire is now burning at the site. The pipelines carry oil for export to the Beiji complex, the largest in Iraq. An American military spokesman in Kuwait said Army experts would try to reach the site on Saturday to determine what had happened. The explosion is the latest and among the clearest acts of sabotage against the Iraqi oil industry. In a recent interview, Phillip J. Carroll, the former Shell Oil executive who heads an American-appointed advisory committee to the Iraqi Oil Ministry, said there had been two attacks on the pipeline from Beiji to Baghdad several weeks ago. Thursday's explosion came just as the State Oil Marketing Organization, which oversees the export of Iraqi oil, announced the companies that would buy Iraq's first oil exports since the war, among them ChevronTexaco and France's TotalFinaElf. Mr. Qazzaz said the pipelines had been carrying relatively low volumes of oil. The section affected was sealed, while the oil remaining inside was being allowed to flow out and burn. That will decrease the pressure in the line and allow Iraqi firefighters to extinguish the blaze in the next two to three days, he said. Mr. Qazzaz said that other attacks could occur, and that ''it is easy to sabotage'' a pipeline. ''We hope that it won't happen often,'' he added. AFTER THE WAR: OIL"
"Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating who detonated a crude bomb inside Yale Law School last month, were looking for explosives and flammable materials when they searched a home of a former university employee on Wednesday night, the former employee's lawyer said today. F.B.I. officials have not publicly stated their reasons for searching the home of the former employee, Benjamin W. Johnson, 23, a Hamden, Conn., resident who once worked in Yale's rare books library. But a New Haven police official said today that Mr. Johnson, who was convicted of larceny and criminal mischief for stealing more than $1.5 million in books and documents from the library in 2001, was one of a few people the F.B.I. was examining for any possible link to the law school bombing. ''They're looking at anyone who would have a grudge against Yale, and he certainly falls in that category,'' said the police official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. No one was hurt in the May 21 explosion, which damaged two empty classrooms and a stairwell inside the law school. Penn Rhodeen, Mr. Johnson's lawyer, said today that his client had nothing to do with the bombing but was cooperating with investigators. Mr. Johnson, who had been participating in a supervised community-release program, probably drew the attention of city police officials, and the F.B.I., during a routine meeting with his parole officer on Wednesday morning, Mr. Rhodeen said. Such meetings allow officers to search Mr. Johnson's belongings, and in his backpack, the parole officer found a notebook containing writings that included references to espionage, Mr. Rhodeen said. Mr. Rhodeen said that though the notes may seem provocative, they were months-old passages that Mr. Johnson, an aspiring writer, had copied from two books: ''Icon,'' a novel by Frederick Forsyth about a disgruntled former C.I.A. spy handler in post-Soviet Russia, and a nonfiction work about the C.I.A. ''Those entries may have piqued their interest,'' Mr. Rhodeen said of the F.B.I., but added that Mr. Johnson was interested in them for literary reasons only. The search warrant issued by agents investigating the Johnson home Wednesday night listed explosives, flammable materials and a computer among the items sought, Mr. Rhodeen said. Mr. Johnson lived there with his parents. F.B.I. officials did not return calls today seeking comment on their search of Mr. Johnson's home. The United States Attorney's office here, which is aiding the Yale bombing investigation, would not comment on the search. The New Haven police official said there are ''probably many more'' people who may possibly harbor ill feelings toward the university and who, therefore, are now the object of increased F.B.I. scrutiny. ''That would be a thorough investigation,'' the official said. Immediately after the meeting with his parole officer, the state's Department of Corrections revoked Mr. Johnson's privilege to participate in the community-release program, his lawyer said, and he has remained in jail since then. He has not been accused of any new crimes. Mr. Rhodeen said he had no reason to believe that federal authorities had planned to investigate Mr. Johnson before his client's appointment with a parole officer."
"Rescue workers continued to search for survivors and more bodies on Saturday after a poisonous cloud from a natural gas explosion left what state news media called a ''death zone.'' More than 40,000 people were evacuated as witnesses described fields with the lifeless bodies of people and animals. Evacuees were shown on state television crowding into emergency shelters throughout this mountainous section of southwestern China. Doctors at makeshift clinics, many of whom were brought from surrounding cities, were treating villagers who lived near the explosion site for poisoning, burns and respiratory problems. The death toll early Saturday morning remained at 191, though that figure could rise as rescue workers search the remote terrain around the Chuandongbei natural gas field where the explosion occurred. A local health official said roughly 10,000 people had sought medical help. The official, Zheng Qingshu, said nearly 1,000 remained hospitalized, including 77 in critical condition. ''Many doctors have been working straight for three days and three nights since the accident,'' said Mr. Zheng, the deputy health director in Kaixian County, where many evacuees were taken. The explosion occurred Tuesday night near the town of Gaoqiao in Kaixian County, apparently after drillers at the natural gas field hit a pressurized deposit of gas and hydrogen sulfide, state media said. Initial reports played down the accident and cited only eight deaths. But by Thursday, officials were mounting a sweeping response as the death toll soared. The explosion was one of the worst in a seemingly incessant string of recent industrial accidents in China, prompting questions about the speed of the rescue efforts. A government official said the death toll highlighted China's need to institute a nationwide emergency response system. ''If we had the system, the rescue work for the gas field blowout could have been carried out more quickly and the casualties would have been reduced greatly,'' Huang Yi, a spokesman for the State Administration on Work Safety, told the state media on Friday. He also called on natural gas and oil drilling companies to strengthen supervision at work sites. The China National Petroleum Corporation, which owns the natural gas field, on Friday ordered emergency safety checks on all its drilling operations. The initial reports of only eight dead raised the possibility that local officials had intentionally tried to prevent the true scope of the accident from becoming public. The early reports also said the explosion had been brought under control quickly. In fact, the well continued to burn Friday. Officials plan to cap the well with cement on Saturday, state media reported. Mr. Zheng, the health official, said eight people died in the immediate aftermath of the explosion. But he said the concentration of poisonous gas was initially so heavy that rescue teams were prevented from moving in and determining the number of dead. By Wednesday, he said, the rescuers were finally able to safely begin searching the area, explaining why the death toll had spiked Thursday. ''When the accident happened, people heard a big bang,'' Mr. Zheng said. ''People saw natural gas firing upward. Many people just fell to the ground.'' The official English-language China Daily described a 10-square-mile region around the explosion site as a death zone and reported that some villagers had died in their sleep from the plume of poison. A local official told the newspapers that bodies had been found in fields and on roadsides, and that dogs, horses, pigs and other livestock had also died. The young and the elderly were said to account for many of the dead. China Daily reported that 39 children under the age of 10 had been killed, while 46 men and women who were 60 or older had also succumbed. Only two of the dead worked at the natural gas field. The rest were farmers and family members who lived in surrounding villages. One villager, Liao Yong, who lives only a few hundred yards from the drilling site, said he was about to go to bed when the explosion shook his home. Mr. Liao told the state media that he had smelled the fetid odor of rotten eggs but had fled only when he heard someone shout: ''Run away! The gas well blew out.'' Rescue workers from around the region and as far away as Beijing were said to be pouring into the site on Saturday. Evacuees were being housed in schools, camps and other buildings. State television showed stunned people, many of them children and elderly people, crowded together with sleeping bags or blankets. Official reports said 14 camps had already accepted more than 23,000 people while 18,000 more were staying in private homes. Trucks brought shipments of rice, instant noodles and biscuits, as well as tents and overcoats."
"A powerful explosion early Wednesday morning killed at least 13 people and injured 22, when a truck collided with a bus at an intersection in western Baghdad. The Iraqi police initially reported that the explosion was caused by a bomb in the truck, but the United States military said later that tests showed no traces of explosives, and that the truck appeared to be a fuel tanker that had crashed. The explosion set nerves on edge in Baghdad, where violence has risen since the capture of Saddam Hussein on Saturday. The force of the blast was huge, even by the standards of a nation now accustomed to stupendous explosions, and among the victims were two young girls and a boy. ''It was horrible,'' said Ahmed Suheil, an Iraqi policeman at the scene, who said the truck was packed with large amounts of explosives. ''I have never seen a bomb this big.'' The military kept up its pressure in Samarra, north of Baghdad, a city considered a major center of the insurgency. It reported the arrests of two dozen people in raids there on Wednesday, after a sweep the day before in which 73 suspected resistors were detained, along with a substantial amount of bomb-making material. ''Samarra has been a little bit of a thorn in our side,'' Lt. Col. Nathan Sassaman, of the Fourth Infantry Division, told reporters. ''It hasn't come along as quickly as other cities in the rebuilding of Iraq. This operation is designed to bring them up to speed.'' On Wednesday night the raids continued, as Apache helicopters hovered over Samarra and tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles rumbled through the streets. An American soldier was killed Wednesday night in central Baghdad, a spokeswoman for the American military told Reuters on Thursday. She said a patrol from the First Armored Division was attacked in the Karradah neighborhood at about 10:30 p.m. on Wednesday. Since Mr. Hussein was captured in a hole near his hometown, Tikrit, there have been violent demonstrations, several of which have ended in firefights with American troops in areas north and west of Baghdad, where support for Mr. Hussein remains strong. On Wednesday in Bayji, a northern oil-producing city, soldiers fired warning shots over the heads of protesters who were spitting at soldiers and yelling as they paraded with portraits of Mr. Hussein. Several threw rocks at tanker trucks ferrying gasoline from Turkey. ''We are demonstrating because those Americans are Jews and we are Muslims,'' said one protester, Arkan Abdullah, who was carrying a picture of Mr. Hussein. ''We can never accept their presence in Iraq, with Saddam or without Saddam.'' On Wednesday delegates on the Iraqi Governing Council, the 25-member body appointed by the Americans to help run Iraq, denied reports that Mr. Hussein had been taken out of Iraq, possibly to Qatar, on the Persian Gulf. ''Saddam Hussein is still in greater Baghdad and will remain there to be tried in Iraq,'' Mowaffak alRubaie, a council member, said at a news conference here. Before the explosion on Wednesday, there had been two fatal suicide bombings in Iraq since Mr. Hussein was arrested. On Sunday, only hours after Mr. Hussein was caught but before the news became public, at least 17 Iraqi police officers were killed in a suicide bombing in Khaldiya, west of Baghdad. The next day at least six police officers were killed in one of two suicide bombings at police stations in Baghdad. In Baghdad on Wednesday, the Iraqi police said the yellow tanker truck was seen moving at high speed through an intersection just before 6 a.m. Mr. Suheil said the truck was not hauling a tanker or a trailer, and that investigators believed it was heading toward a police station about half a mile up the road. He said the truck hit a bus and then exploded. THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: BAGHDAD"
"THE enormous blast outside Iraq's holiest Shiite Muslim shrine on Friday did more than kill scores of people in Najaf, including one of the country's most senior Shiite clerics, Ayatollah Muhammad Bakr al-Hakim. It was guaranteed to sow mistrust and division in an already fragmented population whose unity and allegiance will decide whether America's embattled nation-building program in the country succeeds. To date, the United States' greatest failing in Iraq has been its inability to instill broad confidence in American credibility among Iraq's disparate peoples. Without a respected, reliable voice in Iraq to dispel rumors and fears, each group tends to look to its own leaders for answers and to believe those that serve its own political aims. So every anonymous bomb and bullet perpetuates a divisive climate of fear and suspicion that is more damaging to stability than any loss of life or property alone. In that climate, American is set against Iraqi, Sunni against Shiite, even Shiite against Shiite -- and it is the Shiites whose support is crucial to America's success, since they account for 60 percent of all Iraqis. Now, unless an indisputably clear culprit is found for the bombing, the biggest question among Iraqis won't be just whom to blame but, once again, whom to believe. For sure, there will be plenty of suspects, including agents of Saddam Hussein's toppled regime, rivals for power in Iraq's future government, competing Shiite clerics vying for support among the country's devout masses, even the United States, which many Iraqis believe wants to keep Shiite clerics from gaining too much power. Chief on that list for now are Mr. Hussein's Sunni Muslim loyalists; Iraq's Shiite majority has always posed the greatest threat to their rule. Decades ago, Mr. Hussein's henchmen threatened to assassinate Ayatollah Hakim as part of a purge of powerful Shiite leaders. And within hours of Friday's blast, his followers were placing blame for the bomb on underground Baathists who, they say, wanted to remove the cleric from Iraq's evolving political scene. ''It was a car bomb detonated by remote control, and Saddam loyalists have the technology to do this,'' said Hamid al-Bayati, Ayatollah Hakim's London representative. The ayatollah, who had only recently returned from 23 years of exile in Iran, was emerging as one of the most powerful of the Shiite clerics working with the United States to rebuild Iraq. He had renounced his earlier calls for a strict Islamic theocracy and was pushing for a faster transition to democracy, on the bet that the ballot would be the fastest tool to deliver the majority Shiites their long-awaited political power. But rival Shiite factions might also be to blame for his death, though Iraqi Shiites have always been reluctant to admit their deep divisions. Mr. Hussein and others have long exploited those divisions to keep them from forming a powerful united force. Ayatollah Hakim clearly had enemies among the rival Shiite clerics in Najaf, Iraq's holiest Shiite city and the nerve center of Shiite politics. Sayed Moktada al-Sadr has been leading a militant movement from the holy city, preaching that Shiites should resist the kind of cooperation with the allied forces that Ayatollah Hakim had engaged in. Ayatollah Hakim's followers' first reaction was to dismiss the possibility that he could have been killed by rival Shiites, saying that devout Shiites would never damage one of the religion's holiest sites. ''No Shiite would do this,'' Mr. Bayati said. But there has already been violence at the shrine, which houses the tomb of Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad and, to Shiites, his spiritual heir: in April, another Shiite cleric newly returned from exile was shot and stabbed to death near where Ayatollah Hakim died Friday. Sayed Sadr's followers are widely suspected of having carried out the attack along with a bombing a week ago that injured Ayatollah Hakim's uncle. The bombing may also feed mistrust among groups jockeying for power within the country's fragile governing council, a 25-member body that hopes to form an interim government once the United States agrees. The council has been embroiled for weeks in complicated negotiations over how to divide up ministries, and the results of those negotiations were to have been made public Saturday. However those mistrusts among the various Iraqi groups sort themselves out, the Americans who want to reorganize and pacify the country have one more set of suspicions to worry about: accusations of responsibility, direct or indirect, that are sure to be leveled at the United States. Americans are already mistrusted by many of the poor and largely uneducated Shiites who form the bulk of Iraq's Shiite population, based on memories of being abandoned during an American-inspired uprising against Mr. Hussein in 1991. Within hours of the Najaf bombing, some Shiites were willing to believe the American-led coalition was directly responsible, on the theory that it wants to intimidate and divide the Shiite clergy. And even if an Iraqi group emerges to take clear responsibility, there will be room to blame the United States, if only because it set itself up as the force that would bring Iraq a more civilized order, and because it might have done more to protect the ayatollah. ''At the end of the day it is the responsibility of the allies to maintain security in Iraq,'' Mr. Bayati said."
"A crude bomb slightly wounded a leading Shiite cleric and killed three of his bodyguards today in the holy city of Najaf. The bomb, made from a cooking-gas cylinder, exploded outside the residence of the cleric, Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Said al-Hakim. Senior religious officials were quick to blame the attack on members of the deposed Baath Party, saying the attack was an attempt to foment schisms within the Shiite community. They also criticized the American-led occupation for failing to provide better security. But there has been tension in recent weeks in the Hawza, as the entire Shiite seminary movement is known, between those working with the occupation authority and those demanding that Shiites -- 60 percent of a population of 25 million -- be more assertive in claiming a political role. The ayatollah lives in a modest two-story concrete house on an unpaved side street in the city. His son, Sayyid Mohammed Hussein al-Hakim, said that the two had been talking and that his father had been about to leave the house when the bomb exploded. ''There was a big explosion,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''It created a large hole in the wall and the floor of one room. The house went dark and it created a big cloud of dust and broke all the glass in the windows.'' The younger Mr. Hakim said that his father, who is 70, suffered minor neck wounds and that six other people were been wpunded when the bomb exploded in the early afternoon. The ayatollah is one of the four leading clerics in the Hawza. His opinion on religious and temporal matters is sought by Shiites in Iraq and beyond. Under the government of Saddam Hussein, such leaders were usually kept under house arrest. AFTER THE WAR: ATTACK"
"Lax supervision and training at a sign-making company was the main cause of a chemical explosion that ripped through a Manhattan building last year, injuring at least 42 people, federal investigators have concluded. Those problems at the company, Kaltech Industries Group, were compounded by multiple failures of the government to inspect and monitor the business, and by what the investigators said were outdated New York City fire code provisions about chemical safety. The explosion, on April 25, 2002, blew through an 11-story loft building on West 19th Street in Manhattan. A metal drum in the basement where Kaltech stored and mixed materials became a bomb, investigators said, when lacquer thinner and nitric acid were inadvertently combined. But the final report on the explosion, which is to be issued today by the United States Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, said that what happened in the basement that day could perhaps have been prevented. Kaltech was never inspected by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the report said, or by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, which monitors hazardous waste disposal rules. New York City inspectors, from the Fire Department and the Department of Environmental Protection, did visit Kaltech, the report said, but the lack of up-to-date fire code language on chemical handling did not focus those inspections on some of the things that later contributed to the blast. Up-to-date fire codes elsewhere around the country have specific requirements about container labeling, worker training rules and separation of incompatible chemicals, for example -- provisions that New York's code lacks, the report said. ''They were not looking at the matters that were most gravely manifest on April 25, 2002,'' said Dr. Gerald V. Poje, a member of the Chemical Safety Board, referring to the city's inspectors. ''And we believe that without a better framework to guide them in the future, we're going to continue to have such problems.'' Francis X. Gribbon, a spokesman for the City Fire Department, said the city regularly updated and reviewed the fire code. He said that the department would favor any change that enhanced public safety and that department officials had been working with the Chemical Board on its investigation. But Mr. Gribbon said the primary issue in the Chelsea blast was not the absence of rules or regulations, but rather the violation of the rules that already exist about proper storage and mixing of hazardous volatile compounds. ''It's apparent that what occurred here were violations of existing laws, so it's not just a matter of needing more laws to prevent a tragic accident,'' Mr. Gribbon said. A call to the owners of Kaltech Industries was not returned. A spokesman for the State Department of Environmental Conservation said that the agency had cooperated in the investigation and would incorporate its findings into its future oversight procedures. The five-member Chemical Board, an independent federal agency that investigates industrial chemical accidents, recommended in its report that the city also tighten the rules about communication among tenants in mixed-use buildings like the one where the blast occurred. In such a dense urban environment, the report said, tenants should know what is in their building's basement, and the city should make sure they do, through stricter reporting about chemical inventories."
"In a display of computerized pyrotechnics, exploding fireworks shells will form a 1,000-foot-high vertical circle of light over the Central Park reservoir on Monday. The white-hot halo is the centerpiece of ''Light Cycle,'' a three-part, four-minute fireworks exhibition marking the park's 150th anniversary. The display is scheduled to start at 7:45 p.m. To create the circle, shown in an artist's rendering below, each shell is loaded with a microchip that can control the timing of its explosion to within one-hundredth of a second, compared with more than a half-second for conventional powder fuses. With the aid of computer modeling that accounts for wind speed and other factors, the pinpoint timing enables each shell to be precisely positioned at the instant it bursts. Cai Guo-Qiang, the Chinese-born artist who created ''Light Cycle,'' said through an interpreter that the chip-controlled shells allowed him ''to use the sky as a canvas and draw at will.'' Fireworks by Grucci, based in Brookhaven, N.Y., will launch the 11,000 shells in just 9 seconds, compared with the 8,000 shells it fired over 27 minutes during a display on the Fourth of July. A network of four laptop computers will issue the firing commands. Likening the circle-depiction process to the way images are formed on a television screen from small points of light, Phil Grucci, Grucci's executive vice president, called the shells ''pixel bursts.'' ''Light Cycle'' was organized by the public-art organization Creative Time and is being presented by the City of New York and the Central Park Conservancy. Matthew Mirapaul NEWS WATCH: FIREWORKS"
"On the block where it happened, there were no ''we will never forget'' speeches, no candles or bronze plaques bolted to the wall that has never been repaired. All that was there yesterday was the noontime crowd, swirling by with lunch to be gulped, errands to be run and an afternoon of work waiting to be done. In other words, no one was paying much attention. That was pretty much what the noontime crowd was doing on Sept. 16, 1920 -- 83 years ago yesterday -- when a bomb exploded there. And that was why, after the dead had been taken to the morgue and the injured to hospitals on that Thursday afternoon, there were so many descriptions of the bomb-laden cart that had been parked beneath a window of the J. P. Morgan & Company bank headquarters at 23 Wall Street. In the aftermath, there were questions: What had the horse looked like? What had been painted on the cart? Some witnesses recalled the letters ''D,'' ''N'' and ''T,'' others the word ''dynamite,'' others the word ''DuPont.'' And what color was the smoke, anyway? Black, from dynamite? Yellow, from nitrogylcerine? Blue, from some other explosive? Among witnesses who survived the devastating hail of metal and glass, there was no consensus. But the damage was clear. The fortresslike facade of the Morgan building was pocked with craters that remain deep enough to sink a palm into. The columns of what is now Federal Hall, across the street, were blackened. More than 30 people were killed and several hundred wounded, and the damage exceeded $2 million -- more than $18.4 million in 2003 dollars. ''The number of victims, large though it was, cannot convey the extent of the inferno produced by the explosion, the worst of its kind in American history,'' Paul Avrich, a professor of history at Queens College, wrote in reviewing the case more than a decade ago. The investigators sniffing for clues long ago went from being detectives to historians. The police never charged anyone in the bombing, and it is a mostly forgotten moment in New York City history. ''Nobody remembers,'' said Beverly Gage, whose book ''The Wall Street Explosion: Capitalism, Terrorism and the 1920 Bombing of New York,'' is to be published next year by Oxford University Press. One reason is the speed with which the attack went from rating a banner headline to barely rating a footnote. ''Wall Street's Wall Street,'' said Meg Ventrudo, the assistant director of the Museum of American Financial History. ''Wall Street is more concerned with tomorrow's trades than yesterday's news.'' And as Ms. Gage noted, ''The Morgan bank from the first was rather self-conscious about wanting to get the whole thing over with and forgotten because it wasn't terribly good for business.'' Within a few years, the bombing was hardly talked about on the street. ''There was an article in 1925 or 1926 that I found in The Wall Street Journal, a reporter going down to see what's going on on the anniversary,'' Ms. Gage said. ''People kind of remembered, but he found stenographers standing around who didn't recall the event.'' So, like the passers-by yesterday, they did not remember what Ms. Gage described as the silence that followed the explosion -- two full seconds of quiet just around the corner from the noise of the New York Stock Exchange. By some accounts, the bells at Trinity Church were still tolling 12 o'clock when the bomb went off. A moment later, the shower of glass began -- chunks of glass from windows that had been knocked out by the force of the explosion or by shrapnel hurled in all directions. Some historians speculate that the ramshackle wagon left at the curb was loaded with dynamite and cast-iron springs, or perhaps steel window-casings. The authorities were on the case until the late 1930's. Ms. Gage said one theory was that it was an accident -- the cart part of a thriving underground trade in dynamite during the building boom that followed World War I. ''There were interviews saying, 'You always see carts of explosives going through this neighborhood and I always think, how dangerous,' '' she explained. But the police believed the bomb had been set by Italian anarchists or Communists. In ''Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background'' (Princeton University Press, 1991), Professor Avrich of Queens College argued that the cart had been rigged with explosives and a timer and ridden to its parking place by an angry anarchist named Mario Buda. He was upset, Professor Avrich wrote, by the indictment of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti for a shoe-factory robbery in Massachusetts in which two people were killed. If Buda was indeed lashing out at American capitalism, he missed the most famous of its figures. As Professor Avrich noted, J. P. Morgan Jr. was traveling in Europe. The principal victims were messengers and clerks. Buda eventually sailed for Italy, where he died in 1963. Sacco and Vanzetti were executed in 1927. Yesterday's anniversary went unnoticed across from the Morgan building -- itself now empty -- in what was a Treasury Department building in 1920 and is now a gym. It went unnoticed in a building up the block that bears Donald J. Trump's last name in big, shiny letters. It went unnoticed by people talking on their cellphones, and by a man selling pictures of the World Trade Center and playing cards picturing Saddam Hussein and other former Iraqi leaders from a table on the sidewalk. It would have gone unnoticed by four firefighters who had been dispatched to the building next door, until a reporter told them the story. Lt. Niels Jorgenson, 35, was clearly moved. ''People of my generation would never know the significance of what took place because there's nothing to memorialize the event,'' he said, ''and that's a shame.'' Then two lawyers, Kipp C. Leland and Hewson Chen, arrived. Mr. Leland had read about the bombing on the Web, and wanted Mr. Chen to see the damage. ''Morgan's on the record as saying they'll never repair the damage,'' Mr. Leland said. Mr. Chen said: ''It looks like acid rain damage. The average Joe walking by will be like, 'What a ratty building.' ''"
"After the explosion in her subway car, Anna A. Lvova clambered out without a scratch, but she said that was because she was buried under the dead. At rush hour on Friday morning, Ms. Lvova, 31, said she was standing and reading a magazine in the second car of a train on Moscow's green line as it began to speed north from the Avtozavodskaya station, near Moscow's center, toward the big Paveletskaya rail hub. A bomb -- hidden in a bag or suitcase on the floor, according to state news agencies -- exploded by her car's first door. The force threw her to the floor, flung torn bodies on top of her and turned the car into a shattered wreck. ''People fell on me,'' Ms. Lvova said on Saturday in an interview at Hospital No. 36, where she and more than a dozen other victims remained the day after the bombing, which killed at least 39 and wounded more than 130. ''Everyone was shocked that I look as well as I do,'' she whispered. She picked at her red fleece sweater and declined to say more. The bombing has unleashed waves of grief, fear and suspicion in Moscow and beyond. The Avtozavodskaya station, which was only briefly closed, quickly became an impromptu memorial for those killed, with people coming to lay flowers on the platform. Hundreds of people donated blood for the victims. Moscow's mayor, Yuri M. Luzhkov, declared Monday an official day of mourning and warned grimly that the death toll could rise. More than 100 people remained hospitalized, 21 of them gravely injured. Investigators continued to search for clues to the bombing. They interviewed many victims, like those at hospital No. 36. Many appeared fearful. One, a young woman, emerged from her room to talk to reporters but grew quickly hostile to questions. ''I am great, really great!'' she snapped. During the five years of Russia's latest war to quell separatists in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, Moscow and other cities have borne the brunt of terrorist attacks. The police in Moscow -- acting on a tip, a spokesman said -- detained a man said to resemble a composite sketch of a man suspected of being an accomplice in Friday's bombing. After two hours of questioning, however, the man was released, along with a companion who had also been detained. Many people from the Caucasus, the southern region where Chechnya is located, have complained of detention and questioning in terrorist attacks here based on little more than their ethnicity. The Tekstilshchiki subway station, not far from Avtozavodskaya in southeast Moscow, was evacuated Saturday afternoon after an anonymous telephone call warned of a bomb there. It remained closed in the evening as the police searched the station. While security has been intensified at subway and railroad stations, as well as at airports and other public places, officials seemed to brace themselves for more attacks. In the last year, terrorist attacks have often come in pairs. In December, a suicide bomber killed herself and five others outside the National Hotel in Moscow only four days after one or more bombers killed 47 on a commuter train in the Stavropol region of southern Russia. The authorities there, in the foothills of the Caucasus, ordered markets in the region closed on Saturday and Sunday. The American Embassy warned its citizens to avoid the subway. The bombing prompted rare public criticism of the security services. Izvestia reported that a senior officer of the Federal Security Service, the domestic successor of the K.G.B., had warned that the subway was vulnerable to an attack like Friday's. For Georgi K. Kvitivadze, Hospital No. 36's deputy chief doctor, terrorism's grim results have become all too familiar; his hospital is one of the city's trauma centers and has been, in effect, on terrorist alert since two apartment bombings in Moscow in September 1999 killed and injured hundreds of people. That means staff meetings include a strict accounting of supplies and reserves in case of emergency. Daily calculations show how many beds can be quickly freed in the trauma wards by moving patients to the lightly populated obstetrics ward, for example, to accommodate a potential flood of victims. Dr. Kvitivadze treated the victims of the siege of a Moscow theater in October 2002 that left at least 129 hostages dead, most of them from the effects of a nerve gas used by the commandos who stormed the building. Friday's bombing became a grisly repeat of a drill that has increasingly become a fact of life in Russia. ''Terrorism is a problem everywhere now,'' Dr. Kvitivadze said. He said that the city's health department had warned the hospital to be prepared for an attack, based on a warning from the police about the threat of terrorism around Feb. 23, the 60th anniversary of Stalin's deportation of Chechens from Chechnya during World War II. He said he and the hospital were already prepared for the next disaster. ''We are ready,'' he said, smoking a cigarette in his office."
"A small bomb exploded on Monday outside the apartment of a journalist who has created a political sensation with a behind-the-scenes account of the Kremlin during President Vladimir V. Putin's rise to power. The journalist, Yelena Tregubova, was not injured, but she said in an interview that she feared that the bombing was an attempt on her life. The bomb exploded moments before she left her apartment for a taxi that was waiting downstairs, she said. The force of the blast, estimated at one to two pounds of explosives, destroyed a door opposite hers and broke windows and fixtures in the hallway of her apartment building in the heart of Moscow. A police official said the explosion was being investigated as an act of hooliganism and refused to comment further. It was not clear whether the bombing was related to Ms. Tregubova's book, ''Tales of a Kremlin Digger,'' which recounts, in gossipy detail, her four years as a member of the Kremlin's exclusive news media pool, first as a reporter for Izvestia and then for the business newspaper Kommersant. Ms. Tregubova declined to speculate who could have put a bomb outside her apartment, but she obliquely linked it to the presidential election on March 14. She also said she believed that her telephone was tapped and recounted a recent mysterious call in which a suspicious caller wanted to deliver to her apartment a package she was not expecting. ''It is becoming uncomfortable to live in this city,'' she said in a telephone interview. ''I thought nothing would happen before the presidential election.'' In a country where the inner workings of the Kremlin are shrouded in secrecy and details of Mr. Putin's character are cast in hagiography, Ms. Tregubova's book, which came out last November, was a shock -- and very soon a best seller with more than 100,000 copies sold. In the book, she described meeting Mr. Putin in 1998 when he was still director of the Federal Security Service. At that time, she wrote, he pressed her for her telephone number. A year later, she wrote, she accepted an invitation to a dinner at a sushi restaurant that she expected would be business but that became uncomfortably intimate. In interviews publicizing the book, Ms. Tregubova said she wrote it to highlight how the Kremlin's efforts to control news organizations had greatly restricted freedom of speech. She described warnings by Mr. Putin's press aides not to report some of the president's remarks, including the time in his 2000 election campaign when he told a boy hit by a car, ''From now on, you won't be violating traffic regulations anymore.'' By her account, she lost her access to the Kremlin pool because she refused to hew to the official version of events. After the book appeared, she lost her job as a correspondent for Kommersant. In Novemember, the state-controlled NTV network pulled an interview with her after promoting it for days -- reportedly under pressure from the Kremlin, though network officials denied that."
"An explosion on Monday in the corner of a crowded playground of an elementary school for boys in northern Baghdad killed at least one child and wounded at least three. The American military said the explosion had been caused by a homemade bomb, but a member of the Baghdad police bomb squad said the explosion, apparently the first incident at a school, had been an accident. The American military said the explosion had killed two children and had wounded three others. When the Iraqi police arrived at the school, the Asmaa elementary school, they discovered a second unexploded bomb, or what the military called an ''improvised explosive device,'' near the site of the blast, the military said, adding that the police called in an Army bomb squad, which successfully defused it. But a member of the Baghdad police bomb squad said the blast took place when an old grenade buried in some trash exploded as the trash was being incinerated. He said the second bomb was far from the school, near a hospital. The Iraqi police have said one child was killed, not two, and four wounded. The explosion took place at about 2 p.m., when the children were in the yard for recess, said Zuhair Saleh, who was sitting in the garden of his relatives' home across the street. He and other men scaled the low wall of the school to help the small group of children near the corner where the blast occurred, among them his 7-year-old nephew Mustafa Muhammad Saleh. Mustafa was wounded in the chest and died on the way to the hospital, his uncle said. Two American soldiers were killed on Monday in separate attacks. One was killed when a roadside bomb went off near the town of Baquba, about 30 miles northeast of Baghdad. The second soldier was killed and another was wounded when an explosive erupted in central Baghdad on Monday morning. On Sunday, the military reported that three American civilians had been wounded and one had been killed when their Iraqi taxi was ambushed on the drive from Hilla, in the south, to Baghdad. The Americans were part of a religious group, the military said, without providing further details. Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, deputy chief of operations, said at a news conference on Monday that there have been an average of 17 engagements a day between American soldiers and insurgents during the past week, down from about 22 to 24 the previous week. Commenting on the Saturday attack by insurgents on a police station in the volatile town of Falluja that left at least 25 dead, General Kimmitt contradicted initial reports that foreigners, including Lebanese and Iranians, were involved in the assault. He said it appeared that all the attackers wounded or killed in Falluja were Iraqis. He said Iraqis being questioned regarding the attack included the mayor of Falluja, who had submitted his resignation a few days before the assault, The Associated Press said. The explosion on Monday was at a school in the mostly Shiite working-class Jawadin quarter of Baghdad. But even if it was caused by a bomb, it remains unclear whether it might represent a tactical shift by insurgents to strike a deeper chord of fear among Iraqis by attacking what should be the safest havens and the most helpless victims. Since last summer, rumors have periodically spread through Baghdad that schools would be the targets of bombers, but there have been no previous such attacks. Ghassan Talal Saleh, a relative of a child killed in the explosion, said that schools, including Asmaa elementary school, had received letters recently threatening an attack, but that members of his family had not taken the threats seriously. The report of threatening letters could not be independently verified. Jeffrey B. White, who served with the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency for almost 35 years as a specialist on the Middle East and is now an associate with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, responded to the initial report of a bomb, saying, ''On the face of it, it looks like a terrorist wing rather than remnants of the old regime or Arab nationalists.'' Dr. Samer Rasmi Abdul-Amir, the senior doctor at Muhammad Bakr Hakim Hospital, where three wounded children were taken, said two children were in stable condition and one was in serious condition. The boys were said by hospital staff members to be 6 or 7. ''People may be fearful now of sending their children back to school,'' Dr. Rasmi said. On a night when Baghdad was noisy with weddings before the quiet month of Muharram, the men in Mustafa's family gathered in one room of his house to mourn and the women in another. Mustafa's mother, Qahera Mehdi Saleh, sat quietly on a carpet with her back to the wall, surrounded by her family, as toddlers buzzed around. Ms. Saleh's eyes were swollen with grief. When her son's name was mentioned, she rocked gently and began to weep soundlessly. THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: BAGHDAD"
"A bomb exploded inside a crowded subway train during the morning rush on Friday, killing at least 39 people and wounding more than 130. No one claimed responsibility for the bombing though senior government officials, including President Vladimir V. Putin, said they suspected that it was the latest in a series of terrorist attacks linked to the war in Chechnya. The bomb, said to have been hidden in a backpack or bag, ravaged the second car of the train as it left the Avtozavodskaya station in southeast Moscow and headed toward the city's center at 8:45 a.m. The blast shattered the train's windows, rent its metal seats and bars and hurled bodies and body parts from the train. Hundreds of passengers, some of them bloodied and dazed, had to stagger hundreds of yards through smoke-filled tunnels to reach safety. As they emerged, they described a scene of fear, confusion and carnage deep beneath the heart of the Russian capital. ''I saw five bodies near the tracks and some metal parts,'' said Anna Kolmykova, 51, who was riding two or three cars behind the one where the bomb went off. Police officers who happened to be in her car helped escort the survivors out. ''Those officers warned us about the bodies and pieces of metal so that we would not stumble,'' she said, her face smeared with black soot. As is typical in such attacks, no one came forward to take responsibility, and it was not immediately clear if the explosives had been left on the train or if the blast was the work of a suicide bomber. Mr. Putin, appearing with President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan at the close of a previously scheduled visit, responded indirectly, as he did on Dec. 9 when a suicide bomber killed herself and five others in front of the National Hotel, only a few hundred feet from the Kremlin. Mr. Putin called for an intensified international effort to combat terrorism. ''It is the plague of the 21st century,'' he said in televised remarks. Russia has endured a wave of terrorist bombings stemming from the long, devastating war in Chechnya, but never before has so deadly an attack struck the city's subway. In his remarks, Mr. Putin blamed that wave of terror on Aslan Maskhadov, the separatist leader who served as the president of Chechnya from 1997 until the outbreak of the second war there in 1999. Still, it is not clear who placed the bomb on the train, or whether it was a suicide attack. But it was clearly intended to inflict maximum bloodshed and exploit the darkest fears of Muscovites. The Metro, as the subway is called, is the world's busiest, with more than eight million passengers a day, normally a source of city pride. ''This makes me feel just awful,'' said Ilya Blokhin, 31, a doctor who was aboard the train. ''If they are starting to blow up Metro trains, what is next?'' Mr. Maskhadov, the Chechen leader, has denied ordering attacks, and his chief envoy, Akhmed Zakayev, denounced the one on Friday in a telephone interview from London. Mr. Zakayev said Mr. Maskhadov could not control those in Chechnya who would organize attacks. ''These actions in Moscow against civilians are in no way of benefit to us,'' he said. As he has before, Mr. Putin ruled out any talks with Chechen separatists, despite calls from Mr. Zakayev and others for a negotiated settlement. ''Russia does not negotiate with terrorists,'' Mr. Putin said. ''Russia eliminates them.'' Mr. Putin's remarks -- at once determined, but also indirect -- appeared to have been intended to minimize any political damage from the continued violence and fear that gnaws at the country. Mr. Putin, who rose to power as the second war in Chechnya unfolded, is seeking re-election on March 14. While he is universally expected to win, he finds himself presiding over a conflict that continues to exact a deadly toll far beyond the battered Chechen region, which is in the Caucasus area of southern Russia. With the bombing on Friday, there have been 13 terrorist attacks in the last year, most of them suicide bombings. More than 260 people have died in the attacks, including at least 62 in Moscow. Irina M. Khakamada, a former member of Russia's Parliament who has mounted a quixotic presidential campaign, said the Kremlin's military and political efforts in Chechnya, including a referendum and a presidential election in the region last year, had proved ineffective at ending the violence. ''The peace process that is under way is not guaranteeing people's security,'' she said in a radio interview on Ekho Moskvy. As they have after each of the terrorist attacks here, officials announced that they had increased security at airports and at subway and railroad stations across Moscow and in other major cities, including St. Petersburg. But there appears to be little the authorities can do to halt the attacks, especially those carried out by bombers willing to die. According to officials, witnesses reported seeing a man and a woman who appeared to be from the Caucasus, carrying suspicious bags. It is not clear whether the bombing was a suicide attack, but the authorities later released a composite sketch of the man, suggesting that he was not among those killed. Some politicians called for tougher measures. Dmitry O. Rogozin, the new deputy speaker of parliament and a leader of the nationalist party Motherland, called for a state of emergency and suggested that next month's election be postponed. Without referring to Chechens directly, he blamed ''an ethnic criminal community'' with loyalists in Moscow. ''The enemy is here, inside,'' he told the Interfax news agency. Officials warned that the death toll could still rise. By Friday night more than 110 people remained hospitalized, some with grave injuries. At Sklifosovsky Hospital, the city's main critical care center, a typed list of 36 of the wounded hung on the front door. The bomb struck on the Zamoskvoretskaya Line, also known as the Green Line, which courses through the city center from northwest to southeast. At rush hour the subway is always packed, with passengers jostling shoulder to shoulder. The force of the bomb -- estimated at the equivalent of 11 pounds of dynamite -- shredded bodies, complicating the grim task of counting the dead, let alone identifying them. The survivors were evacuated from the stations between which the wrecked train was stopped, Avtozavodskaya and Paveletskaya, pouring out into public squares choked with ambulances and rescue workers. Ms. Kolmykova described passengers trudging out in darkness with their clothes and hair scorched, but said there had been little panic. The bombing, though, struck a deep chord in her that went beyond simple fear. She said she wanted to emigrate to Italy, which she had visited recently, because Russia had become a country where normal, peaceful life was out of reach. ''I feel so offended for us, for our country,'' she said. ''I want to emigrate not only because of fear. It is a complex of things. Just look at our pensioners. My mother is 77, she is sick and she has to beg for the medicines that she needs and that were prescribed. And in Italy I saw 90-year-olds happy, laughing and dancing.''"
"Lives and innocence were lost 11 years ago today, when the World Trade Center was attacked for the first time. Then the survivors lost again. On Sept. 11, 2001, they lost their memorial -- a simple, circular granite fountain by the artist Elyn Zimmerman, set in a surprisingly tranquil alcove between the north tower and the Marriott Hotel -- where they gathered every Feb. 26 after a Mass at nearby St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church. There, at 12:18 p.m. (by Charles J. Maikish's watch), they would let a moment's silence pass and cast roses onto the rose-colored stones. ''We're sort of a group without a place now to memorialize the sacrifice of those who perished and were injured,'' said Mr. Maikish, who was the director of the world trade department of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey at the time of the 1993 attack. Four authority employees were among the six people killed when a truck bomb exploded on level B2 of the underground parking garage at the trade center. ''In the past, we had the comfort of gathering at a fitting memorial,'' he said. ''We don't have that now.'' Come the 12th anniversary, however, they may once again have a spot. Today, at their annual breakfast, the survivors and relatives will be shown a proposal by the Port Authority for an interim marker that would stand until the permanent memorial, ''Reflecting Absence,'' is built. No definite location for the marker has been chosen yet. Should family members endorse the plan, this temporary memorial would be a brushed stainless-steel pylon, nine and a half feet tall, similar in proportion to one of the twin towers. A wedgelike incision in the middle would serve as a kind of reliquary for the one piece recovered from the original memorial: a chunk of granite 9 inches high, 10 inches wide and 4 inches thick. Eight letters are visible on its polished surface. It says ''mem'' at the top, from the inscription, ''Esta fuente est√° dedicada en memoria de aqu√©llos que perdieron sus vidas.'' (''This fountain is dedicated to the memory of those who lost their lives.'') ''John D'' it says at the bottom, for John DiGiovanni, who happened to have been in the garage at the time of the explosion. His name was inscribed on the perimeter of the fountain base with those of Monica Rodriguez Smith and her unborn child, Wilfredo Mercado, William Macko, Stephen Knapp and Robert Kirkpatrick. The remnant was discovered in the rubble by a Port Authority police officer. ''When this was found, it was something to cling to, to hold on to,'' said Alan Reiss, who narrowly survived the 1993 attack, when he was supervising engineer for operations, and the 2001 attack, when he was director of the world trade department. ''It is so much more than a piece of granite.'' The piece is now kept in an exquisite velvet-lined wood box, with dovetail joints and brass fittings, made by a carpentry class at Bayonne High School. Mr. Reiss, who is the deputy director of the aviation department at the Port Authority, said some family members wanted to be able to see the relic more often than once a year. ''We're not seeking to impose ourselves,'' Mr. Reiss said. ''We're saying: 'We heard you. We have an idea. Here it is.''' No memorial can recreate the sheltered setting of Ms. Zimmerman's fountain, unveiled in 1995. ''It was very much for the community of the World Trade Center,'' she recalled, ''the people who worked there and passed through there all the time.'' That included Michael Macko, one of William Macko's sons, who visited the memorial frequently. ''It was a very important place,'' he said. ''My dad is buried in New Jersey, but to me, this was more his grave than where he's actually buried.'' Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, said yesterday that the 1993 bombing would have a prominent role in the memorial center at ground zero. Mr. Macko, for one, wants to be sure his father is not forgotten in the greater plans. ''A lot of times, it's spoken of as the 9/11 memorial,'' he said. ''Every time that happens, it stings a little.''"
"A fire in an East Village manhole spread to a nearby building last night, causing an explosion that injured a firefighter and forced residents of several buildings outdoors. Firefighters received a call reporting a fire in a manhole outside the building at 183 Avenue B about 8:30 last night, according to William Green, a Fire Department spokesman. The flames spread to an electrical box in the basement of the building, and caused an explosion. One firefighter was knocked to the ground, and was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center with injuries that were not considered life-threatening, Firefighter Green said. Councilwoman Margarita L√≥pez, who lives around the corner from the accident scene, said she was in her bedroom when her lights flickered. ''I heard one humongous explosion,'' she said. ''It was like a bomb.'' She went to the window and saw flames shooting out of a manhole. In the next 15 minutes, she heard two more loud explosions. She left her building and said that smoke that ''smelled like burning cables'' was in the air. Greta Jorgenson, a financial analyst, said: ''I heard a very loud boom and a woman screamed at the top of her lungs. I was really scared and I didn't know what was going on.'' Officials evacuated three buildings, fire officials said. The electricity to those buildings was turned off while the firefighters did their work, and as of midnight had not been turned on again. An official told residents last night that carbon monoxide levels had been high. Residents expressed frustration at the incident, which follows a spate of electrical problems that have plagued the area since January. Ms. L√≥pez, referring to the previous accidents, in which one woman died, said, ''Here we go again.'' A spokeswoman for Consolidated Edison said that the incident was being investigated, but gave no details about the cause of the fire. She said that more than one manhole had been burning. A company official at the site told neighbors that the cause appeared to be burning wires."
"Two Palestinian suicide bombers blew themselves up minutes apart at the industrial port here on Sunday, killing 10 others and prompting Israel's prime minister to cancel a first meeting with his Palestinian counterpart. Hours later, Israeli attack helicopters fired rockets at locations in Gaza City, Palestinians said Monday morning. The bombers, identified by Palestinian militants as young men, ages 17 and 18, from the Gaza Strip, detonated explosives packed with steel ball bearings that wounded at least 18 people and tore limbs off nearby olive trees. If the terrorists did come from Gaza, south of here, it would be the first time in more than three years of conflict that Palestinian suicide bombers overcame an electronic fence that encloses the Gaza Strip to strike inside Israel. Crediting the Gaza fence with stopping attackers in the past, Israel is building a more elaborate barrier against West Bank Palestinians. With its Middle East peace initiative, known as the road map, at a standstill, the Bush administration has been pushing for a meeting between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel and Ahmed Qurei, who was appointed Palestinian prime minister in September. ''The attack shows that Israel still has no partner to implement the road map,'' said David Baker, an official in Mr. Sharon's office. The governing Palestinian Authority condemned the bombings. Militant groups had vowed retaliation last Sunday after Israeli forces killed 14 people, most of them gunmen, in a raid into central Gaza. Shortly before the bombings, Israeli officials reported that they had held ''pleasant but serious'' and productive preparatory talks with the Palestinians for the prime ministers' meeting. Further preparatory talks, to be held Monday, were also canceled after the attack. The meeting between Mr. Sharon and Mr. Qurei had been expected to take place as soon as Tuesday. Responsibility for the attack was claimed by Hamas and Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades, a militant offshoot of Yasir Arafat's Fatah faction. The factions attributed the bombings to the two teenagers, from the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza. Thousands of Palestinians marched in Gaza late Sunday to celebrate the attack, Reuters reported. The bombers exploded roughly 100 yards apart. The first somehow penetrated the 10-foot chain-link fence protecting the industrial zone here and detonated his bomb at the entrance to a warehouse for heavy machinery, shattering windows more than 50 feet up. The second bomber blew up on a sidewalk on the far side of a road that runs outside the fence. His explosion reduced a small prefabricated office building to a tangle of twisted metal that blackened as paper inside burned to ash. Itzhak Tubol, 33, said he was driving home past the warehouse when he saw the first explosion and stopped to help. ''I saw the roof fly off and pieces of flesh fall down,'' he said. ''I spotted a head on the road. I grabbed a plastic bag to pick up the head. As I bent down to pick it up, I felt the second blast.'' Mr. Tubol said he was knocked flat and saw only black for a moment before discovering that he was covered in blood. As he spoke, he lay in Kaplan Medical Center, northeast of Ashdod near Rehovot, with a blood-stained bandage covering a gash in his forehead. Gaza's militants have recently shown signs of a new daring. Last month, Mr. Sharon said he had intended to ''disengage'' from the Palestinians by evacuating most or all of the Israeli settlements in Gaza. Mr. Sharon has said he will pursue his plan unilaterally, without negotiating with the Palestinians, if he judges them to be unwilling to comply with the Bush administration's peace plan. The road map calls for peace between Israel and Arab states and a Palestinian state in three years. Some Israeli officials said dangerous chemicals were stored at Ashdod's port and speculated that the Palestinians intended to carry out what the Israelis call a ''mega-attack.'' But Superintendent Gil Kleiman, a police spokesman, said the police did not suspect such strategic intentions. He said there were no dangerous chemicals in the area of the explosions. ''They were targeting people,'' he said. ''We have had a lot of preparation in the last year in regard to mega-terror, but this isn't it.'' The authorities initially attributed the explosions to an accident. The police realized they were intentional only after rescue workers noticed the similarity between the wounds they were treating and those of suicide bombing victims. Investigators then found shrapnel at the scene. Five bystanders were killed by the warehouse bombing and three by the second explosion, near the office. Two others died in the hospital. Dr. Leon Pones, deputy director of the medical center, said, ''The seriously injured patients sustained organ injuries, head injuries, crush injuries, multiple shrapnels.'' After receiving news of one death, a group of sobbing friends and relatives stumbled out of Kaplan Medical Center. ''Yesterday he helped me and now he's gone,'' said one woman, weeping as two others supported her. Dore Gold, an adviser to Mr. Sharon, compared the attacks to the bombings Thursday that killed 200 people in Madrid. ''These are attacks on sensitive areas of national infrastructure,'' he said. ''And the organizations are clearly not driven by limited aims over which either Europeans or Israelis can have negotiations, but rather by maximalist goals to destroy the societies that they're targeting.'' In central Gaza on Sunday, Israeli forces killed three Palestinian militants near the Israeli settlement of Netazarim. The army said soldiers had found explosives on the men's bodies. Also on Sunday, a Palestinian court ordered the release of four men held on suspicion of killing three American security guards with a bombing attack on an American diplomatic convoy passing through northern Gaza in October. The court cited a lack of evidence. American diplomats and Israeli security officials had previously expressed skepticism that the men being held were responsible."
"A powerful truck bomb exploded at the main gate of the American occupation headquarters here on Sunday morning, killing at least 20 people and wounding at least 60 others, military officials said. It was one of the worst suicide bombings in Iraq since a truck bomber struck the Baghdad headquarters of the United Nations in August, killing 23 people. The United Nations will review the issue of Iraq on Monday, when top American and Iraqi officials will visit officials in New York for an important meeting. At least 18 of the dead were Iraqi civilians, and it was difficult initially to identify the nationalities of the other two, military officials said. Many of the wounded were Iraqis waiting to enter the compound to go to work. No Americans were killed, though several soldiers received minor wounds. Though guerrilla fighters have occasionally lobbed mortar rounds into the heavily fortified American headquarters, a wide zone that contains the former Republican Palace and other buildings of Saddam Hussein's deposed government, this was the first car bomb attack in the area. The attackers appeared to be sending a pointed message by striking at the heart of the American authority in Baghdad one day before senior American and Iraqi officials were to meet at the United Nations about resistance from a powerful Shiite cleric to plans for the scheduled transfer to sovereignty on June 30. Mainly because of security concerns, the United Nations has not returned to Iraq since it suffered the devastating suicide bombing in August, and it is unclear how the attack will affect the New York talks. The bomber drove a white Toyota pickup truck loaded with 1,000 pounds of Soviet-made plastic explosives into the line for vehicle inspections, then detonated it at about 8 a.m., just 50 feet from the gate, military officials said. The blast destroyed six or seven nearby vehicles and set four ablaze. It shook buildings more than a mile away, and the wind carried the acrid smell of smoke across the Tigris River into downtown Baghdad. Dozens of American soldiers surrounded the wreckage as firefighters struggled to put out the flames. At 8:40 a.m., at least three cars still lay smoldering, and a mangled white bus sat in the middle of the avenue. Bodies lay on the ground surrounded by debris as ambulances raced in. Most of the dead were Iraqis who had been sitting in cars at the busy intersection outside the gate, said Col. Ralph Baker, commander of the Second Brigade of the First Armored Division. Concrete blast walls helped protect Iraqis standing at the checkpoint, who suffered wounds rather than death in many cases. He added that the fact that the explosion was outside the perimeter was considered a security success. American officials have used the walled-off area, called the green zone, since the fall of Baghdad in April. Because the compound is so large and the gate is at its very northern perimeter, at the west end of a bridge spanning the Tigris, the attack was obviously aimed at Iraqis working for the Coalition Provisional Authority and its allies rather than at any distinct military target. The attack ''was clearly timed to claim the maximum number of innocent victims,'' L. Paul Bremer III, the top American administrator here, said from the United States in a written statement. ''Once again, it is innocent Iraqis who have been murdered by these terrorists in a senseless act of violence.'' People with dazed expressions and blood on their faces and clothing staggered east across the Jumhuriya Bridge. Weesam Kadhum, 22, a civil engineer working in a building just 300 feet outside the main entrance, said he had seen shrapnel flying. ''Suddenly there was this bright light, and small pieces rained down from the sky,'' he said. ''I ran to my house across the street. I didn't want to stop running. I've only now realized that I don't have any blood or injuries on me.'' His 4-year-old son, Wadah, was wounded slightly by flying glass as the blast shattered the windows of Mr. Kadhum's two-story home and those of other nearby buildings. In Al Karama hospital, Ahmed Ali, lying half-naked in a bed with a shrapnel wound to his torso, said he had been among 200 people standing at the gate to be let into the compound. ''I felt as if a storm had hit,'' said Mr. Ali, 23, who does maintenance for water pumps in the compound. ''There was a huge blast and smoke and fire everywhere. Then the Americans began shooting.'' Colonel Baker disputed his account, though, saying American soldiers did not open fire. In the meeting on Monday in New York, American and Iraqi officials are expected to try to persuade the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, to send a delegation here to lend legitimacy to caucus-style elections for a transitional assembly. Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most influential Shiite cleric in Iraq, renewed a call for direct elections on Jan. 11, hobbling the plans. Many United Nations officials have complained, with regard to the coming meeting, that they were deliberately kept at a distance during the planning stage and are now being asked to validate a process from which they were excluded. The United Nations withdrew from Iraq after the bombing in August, whose victims included Mr. Annan's senior envoy here, Sergio Vieira de Mello. The bombing on Sunday was the deadliest single attack in Baghdad since the attack on the United Nations, which has said it is reluctant to return until security improves. In Tikrit, a homemade bomb being transported in a white Mercedes-Benz late on Saturday night accidentally exploded and killed two men, one of them a relative of Mr. Hussein, The Associated Press reported, quoting an American commander. A third man was seriously wounded. The men were apparently rushing to attack an American patrol when the bomb went off. Right after the explosion in Baghdad, soldiers parked a tank in the middle of the Jumhuriya Bridge to seal off one main road leading to the American headquarters. Jasim Muhammad, a 32-year-old taxi driver with dried blood on his face, gazed vacantly at his shattered red Volkswagen Passat, which sat on the west end of the bridge several hundred feet from the blast site. Mr. Kadhum, the civil engineer, stared at his home, voicing a sentiment that has become all too familiar among Iraqis. ''Of course we're scared living here,'' he said, ''but where can we go?'' THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE INSURGENCY"
"An underground electrical fire blew the covers off three manholes in a succession of explosions yesterday on a street in Queens, shattering windows, knocking out power to two apartment buildings and forcing the evacuation of dozens of residents as acrid smoke and carbon monoxide billowed upward, fire and utility officials said. An elderly woman who had trouble breathing was treated at the scene, and no other injuries were reported. The cause of the fire and explosions, on Crescent Street near Ditmars Boulevard in Astoria, was under investigation, said Martha Liipfert, a Consolidated Edison spokeswoman. But fire officials said the blaze apparently began and spread along electrical lines under the street, leading to three explosions shortly before 5 p.m. that one resident likened to the cannonading in Tchaikovsky's ''1812'' Overture. The first explosion, outside a four-story brick building at 21-70 Crescent Street, hurled up a manhole cover near the west curb and sent smoke pouring into the street. Minutes later and some 100 feet to the north, two more explosions blew off a pair of larger, heavier covers from square sidewalk electrical boxes a few feet apart. The force knocked out power to adjacent buildings at 21-70 and 21-62 Crescent Street, shattered 11 windows on the facades and terrified residents throughout the neighborhood. Firefighters and utility crews responded to fight the flames, and 30 residents of 21-70 Crescent were evacuated after carbon monoxide was detected seeping into the building from a basement electrical box, officials said. The fire was declared under control at 6:53 p.m., and the evacuated residents, who had taken refuge from the cold in nearby cafes and a school, were allowed back into their apartments at 7:15, the city's Office of Emergency Management said. Plywood was put up to cover the shattered windows last night as residents recalled a frightening day. ''It sounded like the cannons in the '1812' Overture,'' said Michelle Colletti, 40, an occupational therapist whose apartment at 21-70 Crescent overlooked the scene. Her lights dimmed just before the first explosion, she said, and as she looked out and saw smoke, her first thought was to unplug her appliances and save her cats, Bernie, Henry and Phineas. She managed to get Bernie down to her parked car, but by the time she went back for Henry and Phineas the firefighters were barring her way and evacuating the building. There was talk of deadly carbon monoxide fumes, and she was worried about the cats. But there was hope: fresh air was blowing into the building through the shattered windows."
"To hear North Korea's state media tell it, in the midst of an inferno of exploding rail cars and dying children, several heroic women made the ultimate sacrifice, running into blazing buildings in frantic attempts to save treasured portraits of Kim Jong Il and his late father, Kim Il Sung. ''Many people of the county evacuated portraits before searching after their family members or saving their household goods,'' the Korean Central News Agency wrote approvingly from Ryongchon, the railroad town where a huge explosion killed at least 161 people and wounded 1,300 last week. ''They were buried under the collapsing building to die a heroic death when they were trying to come out with portraits of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il.'' In North Korea, where the state personality cult is stronger than in Mao's China or Stalin's Russia, loyal citizens need no reminder that their leaders are more important than their own children. A staple of North Korea's propaganda mythology, tales of people sacrificing themselves for portraits of Kim Jong Il, known as the Dear Leader, are being reissued at a time when speculation unleashed by the explosion is swirling. For starters, where is the Dear Leader? One week after the blast, the state media has not chronicled any new doings by North Korea's secretive leader. Admittedly, Mr. Kim lives a Wizard of Oz existence. In his 30 years of political life and 10 years as supreme leader, he is not known to have given a public speech. To prevent assassination attempts, the North Korean media never give clues as to where he is or will be. On April 21, Chinese state television reported that he had just left Beijing for home; everyone knows it is a 12-hour train ride to Pyongyang, North Korea's capital. South Korean reports said his train passed through Ryongchon before dawn on Thursday, about eight hours before the blast. In the days after the blast, reporters in Dandong, on the Chinese border, said Mr. Kim's entourage had been joined by a decoy train when he crossed the border into North Korea, a standard safety precaution. Another nagging question: what caused the blast? Without citing a source or witness, KCNA, the North Korean news agency, said the ''explosion was caused by the contact of electric lines during the shunt of wagons loaded with nitric ammonium fertilizer and tank wagons.'' This explosion, KCNA said, was ''equivalent to the blast of about 100 bombs each weighing one ton.'' How that information could be known remains unclear. Photographs and accounts of foreign aid workers allowed to tour the scene give a picture of total devastation, deep craters surrounded by hundreds of yards of debris and desolation. It is unlikely that any witness to the ignition could have survived the blast. Children accounted for almost half the death toll. About 500 of the 1,300 people wounded were blinded; scores of them were children, according to foreign aid workers who toured hospital wards in Sinuiju, the regional center. Some analysts have speculated that the children were lined up to wave at the train of a passing dignitary. ''So let's ask why half the casualties were kids and why so many of them have facial/eye injuries,'' Robyn Lim, a conservative military analyst in Japan, wrote Tuesday in a Web site posting. ''This might indeed be consistent with the theory that they were lined up.'' Answers are hard to come by because North Korea refused to allow admittance to a group of foreign journalists who gathered at Dandong, about 15 miles north of Ryongchon. To prevent interviews with survivors, North Korea ignored Chinese offers of treatment for victims at hospitals in Dandong. Indeed, North Korea's response to the train tragedy has been consistent with its larger survival strategy: maximize economic gain and minimize political risk. Although the Ryongchon is only a six-hour drive from Seoul, North Korea refused to allow relief goods to arrive by truck from South Korea. South Korea sent its aid by a ship, which arrived at Nampo, on the western coast and about a five-hour drive to Ryongchon, on Wednesday night. The aid, mostly instant noodles, blankets and bottled water, is the first installment of what is certain to be a large outpouring of help from South Korea, where telethons and charity drives are complementing aid plans offered by lawmakers from the Uri Party. KCNA announced on Wednesday that the destruction of the core of Ryongchon caused about $350 million in damages."
"As black smoke wreathed the North Korean city where dozens were killed and thousands were injured in a train explosion on Thursday, the North Korean government reached out to the world on Friday in a rare international appeal for help in recovering from the disaster. The train explosion, which the North Korean government characterized as an accident, leveled the densely populated core of Ryongchon, a small city of about 20,000 people near the Chinese border. The blast flattened 1,850 homes and damaged 6,350 more, and rained debris for miles around. The official casualty toll, which is expected to climb over the weekend, was 54 dead and 1,249 injured as of Friday, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Beijing. Original reports on Thursday said an estimated 3,000 people had been killed or injured . In Pyongyang, the capital, North Korean officials told aid workers that the explosion was set off when railroad workers mishandled electric power connectors over a freight train, showering sparks onto a car loaded with dynamite. On Saturday, two days after the explosion, Pyongyang's state-controlled news media made the first acknowledgment of the disaster, saying only that the damages were very serious. ""An explosion occurred at Ryongchon railway station in North Phyongan Province on April 22 due to the electrical contact caused by carelessness during the shunting of wagons loaded with ammonium nitrate fertilizer and tank wagons,"" the Korean Central News Agency said. It added that the North ""appreciates the willingness expressed by the governments of various countries and international bodies and organizations to render humanitarian assistance."" Breaking with past practice of covering up such events, North Korean diplomats made appeals for aid to Moscow, London, Geneva and the United Nations. That move reflects the secretive nation's cautious opening to the world. Since 2000, about a dozen Western embassies and international aid missions have opened in Pyongyang. After the floods and famine in the mid-1990's, North Korean welfare officials have become accustomed to working with foreign aid groups. On Saturday, North Korea's two neighbors, China and South Korea, each offered $1 million in emergency aid. ""It's rightful to offer emergency aid program, regardless of the North's official request,"" the acting South Korean president, Goh Kun, told officials at a meeting in Seoul. Prior to the meeting, Unification Minister Jeong Se Hyun told reporters, ""The South Korean government will send emergency aid supplies and medicines worth $1 million to the North and will meet North Korean officials on Monday to discuss the train blast."" One aid agency official who was briefed by the government said Friday, ''They have said that 150 people died in the explosion, including some schoolchildren, some buildings have collapsed, 800 residences were destroyed, and over 1,000 people were injured.'' The official, Ann O'Mahony, regional director of Concern, told Irish state radio RTE that railroad workers at Ryongchon ''got caught in the overhead electric wiring.'' The explosion, which occurred around noon, took place only hours after a train carrying North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, passed through the station en route to Pyongyang from China. Usually Mr. Kim's travels are only announced after he has returned home, but, under pressure from Western news reports of the explosion, Chinese television broadcast the news of his departure from Beijing about 12 hours before his predawn passage through Ryongchon. As is customary, Mr. Kim's train was joined by a decoy train after crossing the Yalu River, 10 miles north of Ryongchon. ''I would not be so surprised if it turned out to be a planned attempt,'' said Kim Sang-Hun, a human rights campaigner here, echoing remarks common in Seoul on Friday that the explosion may have been an attempt to assassinate Mr. Kim. South Korean officials, who generally offer mildly optimistic assessments of events in North Korea, discounted assassination theories. ''It seems that possibility is not likely, considering the time of the accident,'' the South Korean unification minister, Mr. Jeong, said Friday when asked at a news conference about possible sabotage. ''With Kim's special train going through, other trains probably were shunted to sidings -- this is my speculation.'' The disaster occurred on a dilapidated railroad network, starved for investment and run under primitive safety standards. Moving slowly and stopping frequently for lack of electricity, trains are often overcrowded, sometimes carrying passengers on the roofs of cars. Historically, North Korea has covered up train wrecks. To pierce that veil, Yonhap, a South Korean news agency, on Friday published a list of rail disasters, based on interviews with defectors. The list included a train crash that killed or injured 2,000 people in 1997 and another that killed or injured 1,000 people in January 2000. There was no breakdown of how many were killed or injured. According to The JoongAng Ilbo, a South Korean newspaper, a passenger train packed with Chinese travelers was in the station when the accident happened. The explosion was so strong it reportedly knocked down a five story building and 12 government buildings, including a school. The United States is a major food donor to North Korea, despite Washington's efforts to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program. On Friday, a State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, told reporters about possible aid for the train disaster. ''We have provided assistance in the past for humanitarian needs in North Korea, and there's no particular obstacle to that,'' he said. The World Food Program, Unicef, the International Red Cross and representatives of the some 20 non-governmental organizations traveled to the area to evaluate needs. The World Health Organization sent medical kits, Unicef sent water-purification tablets, the World Food Program sent food and the Red Cross sent blankets. North Korea's health system is short on supplies and electricity, mirroring the general dilapidation of the state-dominated economy. Several hundred Chinese live in Ryongchon, a trading city near the Yellow Sea. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Friday that two Chinese residents had been killed in the explosion and 10 injured. On Friday, cross-border rail traffic was suspended. Relatives of Chinese who had traveled to North Korea sought information from people crossing by bus on the Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge, a road and rail bridge over the Yalu River. Correction: May 28, 2004, Friday An article on April 27 about the Bush administration's offer of emergency help to North Korea for victims of a train explosion misidentified the organization designated to administer it. (The error also occurred in an article on April 24 about North Korea's appeal for aid.) It is the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which assists victims of natural and manmade disasters, not the International Committee of the Red Cross, which provides aid to victims of military conflicts. The Times was notified of the error on April 28; this correction was delayed by an editing lapse."
"A powerful explosion and fire at a car dealership on Long Island yesterday afternoon injured nine employees, collapsed a large building and rained debris onto a highway that blocked traffic for hours, the police said. ''I don't know how they lived -- it's remarkable,'' said Tommy Goemans, a nearby worker. Victims of the blast, at the used-car division of Habberstad Nissan at 850 East Jericho Turnpike in Huntington, were taken to Huntington Hospital, where a spokeswoman said none of the injuries were life-threatening. No one was killed. Many of the victims were pulled from the wreckage by workers from neighborhood businesses. The Suffolk County police said they believed that everyone was accounted for. The police said the cause of the explosion and fire was still under investigation. One emergency truck at the site was from KeySpan Energy Corporation, which supplies natural gas. The dealership's co-owner, Susan Habberstad, who arrived after the explosion, said the building did not have natural gas service. But, she said, emergency workers speculated that gas might have leaked into the basement and been ignited by an oil heater. The explosion occurred shortly before 4 p.m., rattling windows and startling workers in the dealer's nearby new-car showroom and in neighboring businesses. ''The whole building shook,'' said Tara Meyer, 25, a cashier in the main building. ''There were women screaming inside.'' The main building was not damaged. Employees from that building and from nearby businesses raced to the damaged building and began pulling out trapped people. The roof of the two-story structure caved in, coming to rest about three feet from the ground. Ira Mally, 56, a parts manager at the dealership who joined in the rescue effort, said: ''The people were very heroic. The roof was teetering.'' Most of the 15 employees inside were evacuated as dozens of police cars, fire engines, ambulances and other emergency vehicles converged on the scene. The emergency crews took out the last two or three people. The injured workers were escorted across the street to the lawn of the Huntington Manor volunteer fire department, and the more serious cases were taken from there to the hospital. Once the people were pulled free, smoke began pouring out of the collapsed building, followed by orange fireballs. Hours later, the site still emitted smoke and steam. Broken glass, concrete blocks, pieces of wood and even office computers were strewn across the road. Police roadblocks diverted traffic, which was snarled throughout the evening rush. One rescuer, Eric Leibowitz, 34, said he ran to the scene from a nearby insurance office, where he is a broker. ''I was climbing up on the roof,'' he said. ''There was a chain of people coming out. We pulled out about six people.'' Jim Avery, whose son, Tywan Johnson, was working inside the building, said he talked to him at the hospital. He relayed this description of the explosion: ''The whole building tilted to one side, and he tried to hold on to a co-worker but couldn't, and she was trapped,'' the father said. ''It was chaos.'' Mr. Avery said his son had been working there only six weeks. Mr. Goemans, a manager from the main office, said that when the used-car building blew up, ''you felt your whole body shook.'' The building ''looked like a kid built a house of cards,'' and then ''it pancaked,'' he said. ''It tilted to one side, and the furniture and people slid.'' He said he heard women inside yelling, ''Please find me, help me get out!'' The used-car manager, Dominic Penna, was in particular danger because his office was in the basement, under the collapsed structure. He was hospitalized with several injuries, but co-workers said he was also upset because the explosion destroyed his own car, a red Corvette."
"Ron Williams was pouring himself a cup of coffee at 6:45 Thursday morning when he heard a huge blast that made his kitchen windows shiver. ''A bomb, a bomb, that's what I was thinking,'' Mr. Williams said. He plunked down his coffee cup and dashed into the street. He saw black smoke, police helicopters and broken glass. ''I thought maybe terrorists tried to sneak a bomb into the tunnel,'' said Mr. Williams, a retired cabinetmaker, who lives four blocks from the Lincoln Tunnel. Authorities also thought at first that the blast on Hackensack Road in Weehawken might be a terrorist strike, so they immediately sent a phalanx of federal, state and local law enforcement officers. Police speedboats raced up the Hudson River to guard the bridges. ''Land, sea and air -- we had it all covered,'' said a spokesman for New Jersey State Police, Trooper Stephen Jones. ''This came in as a car bomb,'' Trooper Jones said, and because of the proximity to the Lincoln Tunnel, ''we weren't taking chances.'' By 9 a.m., though, it was clear that the explosion was not some Qaeda strike but an accident. Law-enforcement officials said a 27-year-old sheet metal worker, Giles Lison, was sitting alone in his Volkswagen parked up the street from his home when the car exploded. They said it was most likely that the blast was caused by a leaky tank of acetylene, a highly flammable compressed gas used in welding, that was found in the back seat. ''This was not a terrorist attack,'' said Richard Kelly, an F.B.I. spokesman. The explosion killed Mr. Lison, tore apart the Volkswagen and damaged several nearby homes. The man's charred body was found in the car, along with two other compressed-gas cylinders. It is not clear what ignited the explosion -- a cigarette, the car's ignition switch, possibly something else. ''All we know right now was that it was a tragic accident,'' said the Weehawken Police Department's deputy director, Robert Zucconi. The blast was sharp and frightening, rousing people in nearby Hoboken. A crowd soon formed, and nervous energy quickly filled what is normally a quiet neighborhood of brick homes and curvy streets tucked above the Lincoln Tunnel. Men and women in T-shirts and sweat pants stepped outside, smelled the acrid smoke and flashed looks to each other that said, ''What the heck was that?'' Many said terrorism was on their minds. ''We're all so on edge,'' said Charis Rey, a Weehawken fitness trainer, who joined the crowd. ''It's hard to go about your life and not think about terrorism.'' When word got out that the blast was an accident, not a bomb, the crowd melted away. Some were relieved, others deflated. ''Just a leaky tank?'' Mr. Williams asked. A second vehicle fire in Weehawken, also near the Lincoln Tunnel, caused more jitters. In that case, a minibus caught fire near Gregory Avenue around 8:30 a.m., snarling traffic but injuring no one. Firefighters blamed a faulty engine part. Margaret Parmer, a grandmother from Philadelphia visiting her daughter in Weehawken, said she felt sorry for children today. She was among the crowd peering over the shoulders of the police toward the blackened car down the street. ''Life really is worse now,'' she said. Ms. Parmer looked down into her stroller at her 6-month-old grandson, who smiled up at her. ''Sweet child,'' she said. ''He doesn't have a clue.''"
"The geese came in from the north, flying in a slightly broken V. When they flew above the booms and crashes of southern Falluja, it was as if they had hit a force field -- the V dissolved into a tangle of confused circles, the migration stopped, the birds veered past each other in the sky, seemingly trapped above a sliver of apocalypse. It was the battle for the last district of the city controlled by the rebels, a mechanized assault in which tank blasts brought down the sides of buildings as if they were waterfalls and howitzer shots shook the ground over and over, like the aftershocks of some great earthquake. Out beyond the southeastern edge of the city, a dog loped along a road next to an American officer who was watching the battle through his binoculars. In the necessarily hardened world view of the officer, Col. Michael D. Formica, the battle was as compelling as some rare natural phenomenon. ''You don't often get to see this,'' he said. At one point, an exchange broke out between a group of insurgents grouped in houses around a mosque and an M1 tank. The rebels were invisible, but their Kalashnikov rifles could be seen poking out all around the mosque's minarets. The tank fired back at them, the flash of its cannon visible even in the bright sunlight, and a huge chunk of masonry on one of the buildings collapsed into dust. The air erupted with heavy explosions and the chatter of various different machine guns: the heavier .50-caliber contrasting with the 7.62 millimeter guns and the sharp tok-tok of the insurgents' rifles. Then the battle got a little too close. A stray bullet whined nearby, kicking up a cloud of dust just 20 feet away, then another. ''That's enough, let's get out of here,'' Colonel Formica said. But inside the city, the fury of the battle mounted, and it was as inescapable as any major cataclysm. An American sniper on a rooftop, alerted by the baying of a pack of dogs, saw a group of men crawling on all fours across a field. He fired and hit one of the men. Another took off his shirt and waved it in a sign of surrender. ''We've been trying to get out,'' one of the men said. ''The mujahedeen will not let people out.'' Not surprisingly, shock and disorientation stalked these men as surely as the danger had. ''I am ready to provide more information to you,'' one of them said, ''if you let me see my mother.'' As the battle rose in pitch throughout the day, each blast became painful, a jarring of the bones. An airstrike hit what seemed to be a weapons cache, the earth shook and a fireball catapulted into the sky. A tank fired point-blank into a house and the concussion blew over a telephone pole 30 feet away. The explosion of a mortar shell fired by the insurgents, who were trapped in the southern neighborhood called Shuhada by the locals and Queens by the Americans, sounded like a thunderbolt blasting a tree 50 feet away. The insurgents could be seen running about on the grounds of a mosque that they had converted into a bunker, falling dead as bullets and shrapnel cut them down or disappearing into some alcove or alley and reappearing again. The captured men said that the insurgents were terrified of the monstrous Abrams tanks that the Americans had brought to this battle, the tanks that shrug off rocket-propelled grenades as if they were plastic toys and whose muzzle blasts sound like the end of the world. Around 5 p.m., after the cornered insurgents had been battered for almost 12 hours by merciless air and artillery strikes, 14 of those tanks and 14 Bradley fighting vehicles pulled out of a sandy staging area north of Shuhada and roared toward the neighborhood. The tanks were so enormous that there was only one access street wide enough to accommodate them, so the vehicles lined up as if they were going to be in a Veterans Day parade. They went in with guns blasting, blowing holes in buildings, rolling over walls, snapping off light poles, kicking up giant billowing clouds of dust and creating a deafening sound like an explosion that would never end. It took a full five minutes for the geese to reform their V pattern and continue on their way. They turned and headed southwest. THE CONFLICT IN IRAQ: COMBAT"
"A bomb damaged a Muslim elementary school here before dawn on Monday, in what the authorities say they believe was intended as an act of revenge for the killing of a Dutch filmmaker last week. No one was wounded in the attack, in which a medium-sized bomb exploded outside the Tarieq Ibnu Zyad Islamic school. The blast blew out windows and knocked the school's green doors ajar. Late in the day, police investigators in white protective suits continued to comb the wreckage for clues. The Dutch authorities have been bracing for reprisals against Muslims after the killing on Nov. 2 of Theo van Gogh, a filmmaker widely known for his mocking criticism of conservative Muslims. The main suspect in the killing is a young Muslim who sought to make contact with militant groups in the past. The bombing was the most serious incident of anti-Muslim violence in recent days, but not the only one. Extra police officers have been put on the streets of some cities, and politicians have appealed for calm before Mr. van Gogh's funeral on Tuesday, which is also the anniversary of Kristallnacht, the wave of anti-Semitic attacks pushed by Hitler in 1938. The anniversary has inspired anti-immigration acts in Europe in the past. Mr. van Gogh's killing has unleashed widespread anger toward the country's growing conservative Muslim population, much of which rejects the liberal tenets of Dutch society. The conflict is echoed across Europe, where decades of gradual Muslim immigration have created communities that are often at odds with the larger societies. But Muslims argue that those frustrations, fueled by a fear of terrorism, unfairly taint the country's broader Muslim population. Eindhoven's 20,000 Muslims, in particular, say they have been battling a reputation for harboring Islamic extremists since the town was cited in news reports several years ago. After the explosion on Monday, the city's mayor called for unity. ''It is essential that we stick together,'' the mayor, Alexander Sakkers, said after a news conference at the city hall. ''We are a multicultural society working very well together, and we can't allow a few idiots to pull us apart.'' Last year, firebombs were thrown through the windows of the same school, setting a hallway on fire. That attack appeared to have been a reaction to the acquittal of 12 men who had been charged with recruiting Muslims in the Netherlands for Islamic holy wars abroad. Al Fourqaan mosque, which shares a building with Al Fourqaan Islamic Center, the organization that operates the school, was investigated on suspicion of taking part in the recruiting network after two young Eindhoven men who had attended the mosque were killed in Kashmir, the territory contested by India and Pakistan. Subsequent reports said two of the hijackers in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi, once attended a conference at the mosque, a charge that leaders of the mosque deny. ''It's ludicrous,'' said Saeed Muhammad, spokesman for the mosque, complaining that accusations in the news media take on a life of their own. He called the bombing on Monday ''an act of terror against Muslims and kids at the same time'' and decried a double standard that taints all Muslims for acts carried out by individuals like Mr. van Gogh's killer. Mr. Sakkers, the mayor, said the investigation of the mosque had found no wrongdoing and insisted that the city did not deserve its reputation as an extremist hotbed. ''There are no groups of extremists here,'' he said. City officials said late Monday that investigators had yet to determine the kind of explosive used or the identity of the attackers. They ordered round-the-clock police protection of the school and the city's five main mosques."
"A powerful explosion hit a van carrying Chinese engineers working on a multibillion-dollar port project in southwestern Pakistan on Monday morning, killing three of them, government officials said. The blast, apparently from a car bomb, injured nine Chinese and two Pakistani workers. No one took responsibility for the explosion. Nationalist politicians from the Baluch ethnic group, which dominates the area where the blast occurred, have long opposed the construction of the huge seaport. They contend that its goal is to settle other ethnic groups in the province, Baluchistan, and eliminate the national and historical identity of the Baluch people. The construction of the Gwadar Port, on the Arabian Sea, is one of the largest development projects in Pakistan, intended to ease sea traffic to the southern port of Karachi and attract foreign investment to strengthen the country's economy. China, a close ally of Pakistan, is providing $158 million of the $248 million cost of the first phase of the project, which is scheduled to be completed in April 2005. President Pervez Musharraf expressed outrage and sent a letter to the president of China denouncing the attack. ''This most reprehensible act has further fortified our determination to intensify efforts to defeat terrorism and extremism,'' he wrote. The communications minister, Babar Khan Ghauri, said at a news conference in Islamabad that the government did not know who was responsible for the blast. ''The possibility of involvement of foreign hand cannot be ruled out,'' he said, in an oblique reference to India, Pakistan's longtime rival. ''We are looking into all possibilities but cannot say anything definitive at this stage.'' Two years ago, a suicide car bomb attack in Karachi killed 11 French naval engineers who were helping Pakistan's navy to develop the Agosta B-90 submarine. The explosion on Monday took place at 8:27 a.m., when the van carrying 12 Chinese and two Pakistanis was on its way to the coastal town of Gwadar, officials said. A car idling by the roadside blew up as the van passed. Pakistani officials ruled out the possibility of a suicide attack and said they suspected that the car had been detonated by remote control."
"Fourteen people were killed Friday and about a hundred wounded when a powerful bomb ripped through a Shiite mosque in Karachi, according to police officials and state-run media outlets. There were indications that the bombing was a suicide attack, said Aftab Shaikh, the adviser to the chief minister for home affairs, but that had not been confirmed. President Pervez Musharraf called the attack a ''heinous act of terrorism.'' After the explosion, hundreds of angry young men believed to be Shiite Muslims roamed Karachi, setting fire to a gas station, destroying cars and hurling rocks at police officers. Violence between the Shiite and Sunni Muslim sects has killed more than 1,200 in Pakistan over the past 15 years. Sunnis make up 77 percent of the country's population of 150 million, and Shiites 20 percent. A small bomb also exploded outside a hotel in Quetta, wounding three people, police officials said. The explosion in Karachi took place at 1:10 p.m. in a mosque inside a religious school, when a large number of worshipers were at Friday Prayer. The blast was so intense that it damaged the 40-foot-high ceiling, witnesses said. The bomber was believed to be sitting in the first rows of the mosque when he detonated the bomb. The head cleric of the mosque was among the dead."
"North Korea is a whisker smaller than my home state, Mississippi. But when I heard about the explosion last month at Ryongchon train station, I knew I was in for a long, hard drive. As the crow flies, it was 300 miles. But I was in the northeast corner of the country, near the Russian border, when I heard the news on the BBC. With North Korea's bumpy dirt roads and circuitous routes, our convoy of white Toyota Land Cruisers faced a three-day, 800-mile road trip. In March, I moved from Zambia to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and took over the United Nations World Food Program mission, the largest foreign aid program in North Korea. Because I knew our office and staff 10 miles from the blast site at Ryongchon would be overwhelmed, I had to go. Usually it takes four to five days to get travel itineraries approved in North Korea, but the government official who was traveling with us was visibly shocked when he heard of the explosion. So, three days after the blast, which officials said was caused by workers who mishandled electric power connectors near a train, I led a United Nations team into Ryongchon with Tony Banbury, an old friend who now directs W.F.P.'s Asia operations. As we pulled into the city, I couldn't see that anything was wrong. But then we moved closer and saw glass scattered everywhere like pebbles. All the windows had been blown out, and there was debris on the roofs. Then I realized everything was flattened. This reminded me of the pictures I'd seen of World War II bombing campaigns in Dresden. Starting 900 yards from the blast center, all you could see was rubble. At the explosion point, there was a hole that looked big enough to fit four city buses. All around the hole, the ground was littered with little pieces of heavy-gauge steel from the rails or boxcars. I am sure that when the train blew, that stuff shot out like bullets. With each step, I was kicking shrapnel. The area was very calm and quiet. I have been to Kosovo, East Timor, even to a volcanic eruption in Montserrat. By comparison, people here suffer in silence. Three days after a disaster, normally you hear a lot of shouting, hammering and heavy equipment. There were two backhoes and bulldozers, but men were only tinkering with them, either maintaining them or trying to get them started. People were quietly digging through the rubble with their hands, trying to find anything they could salvage from their houses, which had stood nearby. It looked like another black-and-white image from World War II: families trudging away in the cold and gray, with their possessions on ox carts. We asked the city manager what they needed. He said food, building materials, blankets, tents, cooking utensils. We had brought a truckload of food and promised more. There had been a primary school near the station. School let out at noon, and the blast took place at 12:08. I walked into one room and saw two bloody hand prints on one wall. My wife, Marcela, and I had our first child 18 months ago. I just stood there thinking, this must be a parent's worst nightmare: send the kid to school and then find out it has blown up. The area was littered with book bags, papers, children's shoes. When we were at the school, men were cleaning up, throwing desks, chairs and rubbish out the top windows. I guess they had given up searching for survivors. But the day after we were there, they pulled a boy, still alive, out of the rubble I had been standing on. We drove to Sinuija next to visit the People's Provincial Hospital. In our group there were two Americans, a Norwegian, an Irishman and some North Koreans. We were the first foreigners to visit the injured victims. The director said there were 365 patients, and about 60 percent were children. He particularly wanted to show me the most critical patients, in an appeal for help. He saw in me an opportunity to get the support he needed. Some kids were sleeping two to a bed. The legs of a few beds were propped up with rocks to make them flat. There were maybe two or three IV drips in the place. We did not see one mechanical device working. The only person on oxygen had two tubes pushed into his nose, no oxygen mask. A year ago, I broke my collarbone. Hospitals were loud in Zambia. But in this one, I was struck again by the almost ghostlike quiet. Some parents were lying on beds, stroking their children's hair, quietly talking to them. In the parents' faces, you could see what pain they were going through. There was one boy who looked blinded; his face was stitched together with twine. He was standing, and his mother had her arm around him, doing her best to offer comfort. We didn't show up at the hospital to just look around. We delivered oil, biscuits and wheat. But we are pulling resources from a program that is way underfinanced. Across the country, we are supposed to be feeding 6.5 million people a month. In April, we fed 3.2 million. In May, we will be feeding only 2.6 million. And after September, we will be at zero. Maybe this tragedy will jolt the world awake. LIVES"
"A bomb exploded next to a bus stop in Tel Aviv early Sunday, killing one woman and injuring more than 10 people, the police said. The blast was the first bombing in Israel in almost four months, and it came two days after the International Court of Justice in The Hague had called on the government to tear down a major portion of the barrier it is building to fence off the West Bank. Israel maintains that the barrier is necessary to keep out bombers. The Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades, a group linked to Yasir Arafat's Fatah movement, claimed responsibility in a telephone call to Agence France-Presse. The group said it carried out the attack in response to recent Israeli military raids in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. In Gaza City on Saturday, a powerful explosion destroyed a black Mercedes and killed three Palestinian militants traveling in the vehicle on the edge of the city. The cause of the blast was unclear. A fourth Palestinian on a motorcycle was also killed, Palestinians said. Palestinian security officials initially said the attack was carried out by an Israeli helicopter, but later said the car was hit by an Israeli tank shell. However, the Israeli military, which usually acknowledges such strikes, said it was not responsible. A military official said a helicopter had fired warning shots in the area earlier in the day, but had not fired any missiles. The official speculated that the blast might have been caused by a bomb in the car that went off inadvertently. The three men killed in the car belonged to the Popular Resistance Committees, a militant group, the Palestinian security officials said. The Israeli foreign minister said in remarks broadcast Saturday that Israel was looking to the United States to block any United Nations Security Council resolutions that would condemn Israel's barrier in the West Bank. The comments by the foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, came a day after the United Nations' highest court, the International Court of Justice, delivered an advisory ruling that the sections of the barrier being built in the West Bank violated international law and should be torn down. Armed with the decision, Palestinian leaders said they would take the matter to the General Assembly, and possibly the Security Council, seeking a resolution that would put pressure on Israel to comply. ''The issue will go to the Security Council because they have an automatic majority in the U.N. General Assembly,'' Mr. Shalom told Israel Radio. The foreign minister, who had just returned from the United States, said he had asked Washington to prevent any resolution from being passed. Another Israeli official said Israeli diplomats would lobby other members of the Security Council to try to block a resolution. In the past, President Bush has referred to the fence's route inside the West Bank as a ''problem.'' But his administration has said the issue should be settled in political negotiations, not by the international court, a position Mr. Bush's spokesman, Scott McClellan, reiterated Friday. The United States has used its veto power on many occasions to block Council resolutions critical of Israel. But the Palestinian prime minister, Ahmed Qurei, said, ''It is the responsibility of the U.N. to put a mechanism to commit Israel to this decision.'' Mr. Qurei spoke after a meeting on Saturday with a European Union envoy, Marc Otte. The Associated Press, citing sources present at the meeting, reported that Mr. Qurei said during the discussion that he hoped the Americans would not ''sabotage'' the Palestinian efforts at the United Nations. Israel has refused to recognize the international court's authority to rule in the case, and says it will continue building the barrier, which it hopes to complete by the end of next year. Israel says the partly built barrier is already serving its purpose and has contributed to a significant drop in Palestinian suicide bombings. The Palestinians say the barrier has resulted in the confiscation of large tracts of Palestinian-owned land and undermines efforts to establish a viable Palestinian state. In other violence on Saturday, a 16-year-old girl, Haneen Abu Samhadana, was killed by Israeli gunfire in Rafah, at the southern end of the Gaza Strip. Dr. Ali Musa, the director of Al Najar Hospital in Rafah, said she suffered a bullet wound to the chest. An Israeli military official said the army was checking the report, but had no information on any shooting in the area on Saturday."
"Two powerful car bombs exploded in Iraq on Saturday, one apparently aimed at the justice minister and the other at civil defense recruits, as violence against the new Iraqi government continued its upward spiral. At least six Iraqis died, the police and hospital officials said. The justice minister, Malik al-Hassan, who has been outspoken on the need to crack down on insurgents in Iraq, survived the apparently well-coordinated attack near his home in Baghdad. But at least four people, some his bodyguards, were killed. The blast shredded the bomber's car to nothing but an engine block, incinerated two other cars and spewed shrapnel and body parts dozens of yards. [The Philippines said Sunday that the remaining troops of its small force would leave Iraq on Monday in an effort to save the life of a Filipino hostage threatened with beheading, Reuters reported. The terrorists had set a deadline of Tuesday.] Only hours after the blast, an Islamist Web site posted a claim of responsibility from Jamaat al-Tawhid and Jihad, or Unity and Holy War, the group led by the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. It was impossible to verify the authenticity of the claim, but it came unusually quickly. In the past, the group has usually waited a day -- as it did on Friday, when it claimed responsibility for the high-profile killing of the governor of Nineveh Province a day earlier. An hour before the Baghdad blast, at about 7:30 a.m., a car bomb exploded in Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad, as a suicide bomber tried to plow into a line of Iraqis seeking jobs with the civil defense forces. Two Iraqi soldiers providing security were killed, according to Iraqis at the scene. One was Saddam Obeid, 21, who had spent the last few days painting his room for his new bride. He was to be married in a few days. ''Who is going to get married now?'' wailed Riyad Obeid, 22, one of three surviving brothers who held one another in grief outside the morgue of Yarmouk Hospital in Baghdad, where Mr. Obeid's body lay under a pink sheet. ''Who is going to get married in your room?'' Baghdad shuddered on Saturday morning with an unusual number of explosions, after what had been nearly three weeks of relative quiet after the transfer of formal sovereignty to the interim Iraqi government on June 28. At least three large blasts and what sounded like three mortar rounds all exploded before noon, on the anniversary of the day in 1968 when the Baath Party executed a coup that brought Saddam Hussein to the presidency several years later. It is unclear if the violence and the anniversary are related, though former Baath Party members are believed to make up a large part of the insurgency, which regularly attacks Americans and Iraqis. On Thursday, the first major car bomb in weeks killed at least 10 people in Baghdad just outside the Green Zone, the heavily fortified compound that is the center here for both American and Iraqi officials. The same day, militants assassinated Osama Kashmoula, the governor of Nineveh, after attempts on the lives of several other Iraqi government officials in the past two weeks. On Saturday, officials at Yarmouk Hospital said they treated injuries from three explosions, but were so busy they could not immediately say how many victims they had treated. ''We had three explosions, so we are confused now,'' said Firas Mejid, a surgeon who had treated 10 bomb victims before noon. An official said later they had treated 12 people and received three bodies. An American soldier was killed on Saturday near Baiji, south of Mosul, in the north, after a military convoy was struck by a roadside bomb, according to a military statement. Three other soldiers were wounded, the statement said. The attack against the justice minister occurred about 9 a.m., several hundred yards from his home in Jamia, a neighborhood in northwestern Baghdad. Ahmed Hussein, 34, one of the minister's bodyguards, said that he saw a Toyota Corolla parked near the convoy and that it exploded just as the car carrying Mr. Hassan passed by. The windshield of Mr. Hussein's car shattered from the bomb's force, spattering him with glass and severely wounding a colleague, who lay motionless on hospital bed at Yarmouk in a thick puddle of his own blood. ''They are uneducated people, savages,'' Mr. Hussein said in his hospital bed, his head and left eye bandaged from the flying glass. He said he could not understand why Iraqis might be behind the attack. ''They control the government now,'' he said. ''This is the government.'' Haider Abed, 32, a painter hit by flying glass, said he expected that the violence would only intensity now. ''As long as there are terrorists, there will be explosions,'' he said. Hospital officials and others said there was a second explosion near the site of the first one, but that could not be confirmed. In Mahmoudiya, a Sunni enclave south of Baghdad and a spot of regular ambushes against American troops and foreign travelers, Iraqi soldiers fired on a car that failed to stop as it sped toward a line of several dozen potential recruits at a civil defense base. The car then exploded, killing Mr. Obeid and his friend, a fellow civil defense soldier, Adel Tahar, 23. The mother of Mr. Obeid's 17-year-old fianc√©e, Marwa, slumped in sorrow with his brothers at the hospital morgue, with the thumps echoing in the background from the heavy door into the refrigerated room holding the victims of Saturday's violence. ''My brother! My son!'' she cried. The dead man's brother, Riyad, said he did not know how to break the news to their father, a widower who is paralyzed. ''My father will die if he sees the body,'' he said. THE REACH OF WAR: INSURGENTS Correction: July 28, 2004, Wednesday An article on July 17 about violence in Iraq gave an incorrect translation for Jamaat al-Tawhid and Jihad, the name of an Islamic militant group that has claimed responsibility for killings of Iraqi officials. (The error also occurred on July 18 in an article about violence in Iraq.) It is Monotheism and Holy War, not Unity and Holy War."
"Coordinated bomb attacks struck the perimeters of the American and Israeli embassies on Friday in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, killing at least two people and wounding several more, according to government officials and news reports. A third explosion at about the same time hit the lobby of Uzbekistan's general prosecutor's office. The blasts, one of which was described by officials as the work of a suicide bomber, carried potent political symbolism. They struck at three governments that have cooperated closely in campaigns against Islamic militancy, and they occurred at the end of the first week of the trial of 15 Uzbeks accused of taking part in guerrilla and suicide bomb attacks against the government this year. Nearly 50 people died in those attacks, the Uzbek government reported. The bombings on Friday, which showed signs of careful coordination by striking targets scattered in a large city with a highly visible police presence, marked another worrisome sign of a lingering insurgency in a country that has kept intense pressure on its Muslim populace. They also differed from past attacks in that instead of striking symbols of Uzbek authority, they signaled a fresh willingness to seek foreign targets. Uzbekistan is an authoritarian state without independent news media, and its government quickly closed off the area around the blasts. It released only limited details about the attack. But preliminary reports indicated that the bombs had not reached the scale of destruction in previous attacks. One Uzbek counterterrorism official involved in the investigations said in a telephone interview that the bombers had not managed to enter the embassy compounds and that the physical damage they had caused was not severe. Elements of this description were confirmed by Mark Sofer, a deputy director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry. In a telephone interview from Jerusalem, he said the bomb at the Israeli Embassy had exploded near the entrance to the diplomatic compound, killing two Uzbek security officers. He said the evidence pointed toward at least one suicide attacker, which would be a continuation of a tactic first seen in Uzbekistan this spring. There were reports that one of the dead men was the personal Uzbek guard of the Israeli ambassador, Zvi Cohen. A spokeswoman at the Uzbek general prosecutor's office, Svetlana Artykova, said the bomb there detonated just inside the building's entrance, heavily damaging the lobby and wounding several people. Ms. Artykova said it was not clear whether the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber. There were conflicting accounts of the nature of the attack at the American Embassy. News reports said that the blast had been triggered by a man wearing an explosive vest and that as many as three people had been killed. Those accounts were not officially confirmed by the Uzbek or American governments. Malik Ismailov, an assistant to the American Embassy's press attach√©, said by telephone that there were no known casualties among the embassy staff members. He said further details of the attack were being gathered. The American Embassy in Tashkent has long been identified as vulnerable. It is near the curb on a busy city thoroughfare, and it has been scheduled by the State Department for replacement with a modern and safer compound. Groundbreaking on the new embassy has already occurred. As an interim measure, the embassy's walls and fencing -- which had been a simple iron fence that would stop neither shrapnel nor bullets -- were swiftly upgraded by a subsidiary of the Halliburton Company in the fall of 2001. Uzbek guards also typically stand watch along its sidewalk and direct traffic that passes along the embassy's gates. Uzbekistan, a former Soviet state that has drawn international criticism for years for its repression of Muslims and a poor human rights record, has been an uneasy ally of Washington since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Almost immediately afterward, the Uzbek government gave the Pentagon access to an abandoned Soviet air base near its border with Afghanistan, which has been used for military operations against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. The alliance has shown signs of strain recently. This month, Washington announced that it was cutting $18 million in military and economic aid to Tashkent because of what Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, described as ''lack of progress on democratic reform and restrictions put on U.S. assistance partners.'' The country has also been involved in a protracted struggle against Islamic insurgents and terrorists. In 1999, after the crackdown against Islam had intensified and several Islamic activists had fled to exile, a group known as the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan declared holy war against President Islam Karimov and his government. The group's fighters, who trained in Tajikistan and Afghanistan, were blamed for car bombs in the capital that year. American and Uzbek officials have said the group's fighters conducted raids into Uzbekistan during the summers of 1999 and 2000. They also fought with the Taliban against the United States in 2001, and many of its members were killed. American officials say the group's military leader, Juma Namangani, was killed in an airstrike in Afghanistan in 2001, and its imam, Tokhir Yoldesh, had taken shelter with other militants in the Pakistani border regions. The group has largely been quiet in the time since. But after the coordinated attacks this spring, the Uzbek government variously claimed that the militants were members of a splinter faction of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan or that they were from Hizbut-Tahrir, an international Islamic group that has espoused change by peaceful means. The group that ultimately claimed responsibility, calling itself the Jihad Islamic Group, was previously unknown."
"In Belgium's worst industrial accident in decades, a huge leaking gas pipeline exploded Friday morning about 25 miles southwest of here. Initial reports said the blast killed about 15 people and injured hundreds. Before the blast, construction workers at a building site in the Ghislenghien industrial zone, near the town of Ath, reported a strong gas smell. Firemen came to the site and were cordoning off the area when the gas blew up, said Michelle Vanderplaetsen, spokeswoman at the Ministry of Health. She said 10 to 15 people were dead, many of them firefighters, and she added that the toll could rise through the day, as many people were in critical condition with severe burns. The blast catapulted bodies and debris up to hundreds of yards away, according to news reports from the disaster scene. ''There were bodies in parking lots, in the fields; burned-out cars in an area half a kilometer wide,'' a fire department spokesman, Francis Boileau, told Reuters. A crisis center was set up in a local school, and hospitals and burn units from as far away as Germany, France and Britain offered to help treat the victims, Ms. Vanderplaetsen said. Six people were taken to hospitals in France, she said. The Belgian gas distribution company, Fluxys, said the pipeline that exploded ran between the Belgian port of Zeebrugge and France. The pipeline was 3 1/4 feet in diameter and carried more than 57 million cubic feet of gas per hour under high pressure, said Huberte Bettonville, a spokeswoman for Fluxys. ''It was a very big pipeline,'' she said. Fluxys confirmed that a leak in the pipeline led to the blast. The explosion was the worst industrial accident in Belgium in nearly 40 years, Ms. Bettonville said. In 1967, a truck carrying liquid gas exploded in Martelange, killing 22 people. Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt interrupted his vacation in Tuscany, Italy, to monitor the situation. At a news conference, he said there would be a national day of mourning when the dead were buried. He received a condolence call from Prime Minister Jan-Peter Balkenende of The Netherlands. President Jacques Chirac of France and Pope John Paul II were among many who sent similar expressions of sympathy by letter."
"On the night of Sept. 11, 2001, Police Officer Joseph Rodriguez was in as bad shape as many who lived through that day. A witness clearly remembers seeing him staring blankly in a hospital emergency room. His knee was broken, and he was still except for his hands, which worked at shredding chunks of gauze. Officer Rodriguez, now 27, never seemed to fully recover from that day, slipping home into the shadow of a Little Italy cathedral and into a bureaucratic dead zone for several weeks after the attacks, according to a former police supervisor who met him during that time. From there, his short career continued to spiral downward, his guns taken away and his duties restricted to answering telephones. Having effectively ended with the World Trade Center attack, while he was still a rookie, it officially ended yesterday, as he completed the last of his disability pension paperwork. But Officer Rodriguez remains at the center of an investigation into whether, before reporting that he had discovered a flaming knapsack stuffed with a pipe bomb in a subway station on Monday night, he in fact was the one who had placed it there. The backpack exploded about 8 p.m. Monday on the mezzanine leading to the A, C and E subway lines. Officer Rodriguez, fresh off his shift at the Manhattan Transit Task Force office nearby, warned commuters away and received minor injuries in the small explosion, the police said. It was to be his penultimate day in the department; Officer Rodriguez was being forced to retire because of his psychological problems, police officials have said. But his behavior after the blast on Monday, police officials have said -- like the version of events he gave the authorities and his decision to call a friend in the transit office rather than 911, all set against the backdrop of a troubled mind -- has sent the investigation ricocheting back at the man closest to the bag. The officer has not been charged with any crime. Late yesterday, the police executed a search warrant at the officer's home along with agents from the federal Department of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and a bomb-sniffing dog. Earlier they searched his car, and one of the dogs alerted officers to two plastic shopping bags inside, the investigator said. It was unclear last night what the dogs were reacting to in the bags. At the same time, detectives from the Arson and Explosion Squad and the Internal Affairs Bureau, who are investigating the bombing, were awaiting the results of tests on the officers' clothing for traces of unburned gunpowder and on the backpack in an effort to determine whether traces of the bomber's DNA were left behind in sweat on its straps. Little remarkable is known about the young officer's early years or his personal life. Family members remained out of sight yesterday as, conversely, detectives remained highly visible, stationed at the door of his small apartment building on Mulberry Street. A lawyer for Officer Rodriguez, Stuart London, declined to discuss the details of the case, saying only, ''He's put in his papers for his disability pension, and to our understanding the investigation is going forward.'' But a picture emerged yesterday of a focused young man whose last two years, 10 months and 11 days have been irreparably mangled, apparently by the events of Sept. 11. He had just exited the subway and was heading to a Manhattan courthouse when he saw a jet strike the World Trade Center, according to one of Officer Rodriguez's aunts and a person knowledgeable about his career. He ran to help, by one account even struggling with fellow officers trying to keep him back from the falling debris. This version of events is not universal, and a second school of thought among some police officials is much more skeptical of the officer's heroics that day, suggesting instead that he has since been malingering, or faking illness. But one former police supervisor said he clearly remembered his encounter with Officer Rodriguez hours after the towers collapsed. He was so affected by the officer's appearance that it left a lasting impression on him, the former supervisor said. Officer Rodriguez, then 24, was one of a handful of officers in the emergency room of Cabrini Medical Center, across the street from the Police Academy. Outside, officers covered in grime and dust from the trade center's collapse were being decontaminated because of concerns about the possibility of chemicals in the debris. ''He was, I would say, catatonic,'' the former supervisor said. ''He was absolutely monosyllabic in his responses. He was clearly very, very traumatized. The most striking thing about him was physically he was completely passive, unresponsive, except for his hands, which were unbelievably manic. They were ripping at a piece of gauze.'' The officer's mother arrived, and the former supervisor stepped away, returning later to find them both gone, he said. Officer Rodriguez, out of the Police Academy only about six months, apparently went home and stayed there, the former supervisor said. In the chaos of the department after Sept. 11, he was simply and informally recorded as out sick, and it was not until several weeks later that someone called the department's medical offices to check on his return to work, the former supervisor said. ''His paperwork fell through the cracks,'' the former supervisor said. A senior police official said: ''It wasn't until December that in an accounting of where everybody is do they discover that he's still out sick, and they go to his home, and at home he is sort of on the couch. They're disturbed by his behavior and what he's saying, and they take his guns and refer him to pysch services at that point.'' Pat Bonanno, a lawyer for the union that represents New York State Police troopers, among them Manny Rodriguez, the officer's brother, said that Joseph Rodriguez ''was in fact a victim, as were so many other people that day.'' ''He was coming to the aid of people and found himself trapped under the rubble and ultimately was rescued from that situation, and it's having its repercussions as he goes through his life.'' Officer Rodriguez has lived in the area around Mulberry Street in Little Italy his entire life, Mr. Bonanno said. He went first to Washington Irving High School and later transferred to Chelsea High School. Mr. Bonanno said Officer Rodriguez had earned an associate's degree from the Borough of Manhattan Community College and was studying for his bachelor's degree at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. He used to hang out at the John Jovino Company, a gun shop in Lower Manhattan, and so a manager there put him to work part time, behind the counter and cleaning up, the manager said yesterday, calling the officer a ''gun buff.'' Mr. Bonanno said the officer's family was very shaken up. ''They're very concerned -- concerned about the allegations that are being made against him,'' he said. ''They don't want him to be painted in a light that affects his reputation, whatever his mental health issues are.'' Family members said Officer Rodriguez's police work meant everything to him. Remarkably, two people, an aunt and a cousin, said they did not know that he had had any post-Sept. 11 problems or that he had been working on modified duty. ''He always loved his job,'' said Anneliz Contreras, 19, a cousin in East New York, Brooklyn. ''That's the first thing I can tell you. That's his life now. No girlfriends, no nothing. That's what he does.'' No longer. Yesterday, Officer Rodriguez went to the department's pension section. He is entitled to a pension equal to three-quarters of his salary, tax-free. He is expected to check himself into Columbia-Presbyterian Center of New York-Presbyterian Hospital for psychiatric evaluation, according to a person knowledgeable about his plans. Yesterday, in his last act as a police officer, he signed the paperwork that formally separated him from the job."
"Four people were killed when a bomb exploded on a crowded public bus here on Thursday, a few hours after a similar device blew up near a luxury hotel in Ankara, Turkey, where President Bush was due to stay this weekend in advance of the NATO summit meeting on Monday. Turkish security officials said they believed that the Istanbul bomb went off accidentally in the lap of a woman passenger who could have been on her way to detonate it elsewhere in the city. ''The bus was not the target,'' said Gov. Muammer Guler of Istanbul, after visiting the hospital where some of the 15 people wounded were being treated. ''The bomb was being carried from one place to another.'' Turkish security forces have been especially vigilant in the last few weeks in anticipation of the NATO meeting, which has provoked several anti-NATO and anti-American demonstrations across Turkey. Antiterrorism police officers said earlier this week that they had broken up a radical Islamic terrorist cell that had been training for suicide bombings at unspecified locations. But the two bombs discovered Thursday were attributed to obscure leftist forces. ''Taking into account similar explosions that have recently occurred in some parts of Istanbul, there's a high possibility this is an illegal left-wing organization with a Marxist inclination,'' Mr. Guler said. A young woman's severely burned body, cut in two near the waist, was found in the mangled bus after the explosion, several witnesses said. At least one survivor lost a leg in the blast. In Ankara, another bomb exploded near the Hilton hotel, wounding two police officers who were part of a large security force that was setting up for Mr. Bush's arrival in the capital on Saturday night. The police said both bombs were concussion, or ''sound,'' bombs that normally do not cause much damage unless detonated in a closed space, like the inside of a bus. Gunes Dagli, a passenger on the bus who was being treated for injuries to her leg, said she had not noticed anything suspicious or seen anyone on the bus acting strangely before the blast. ''I don't think I can ever forget the faces of the dead and injured lying in front of me,'' Mrs. Dagli, 43, said. ''I don't think I'll be able to go out for a long time and, as long as I live, I will never get on a public bus again.'' Witnesses said glass from the shattered bus windows flew through the air. Panicked passengers scrambled out the windows and doors, some bloodied by the explosion. ''At first we thought a tire blew out on the bus,'' said Tuncay Ozturk, who had just walked past the bus when the bomb exploded. ''But there was a huge cloud of smoke rising up in the air and we realized it was an explosion.'' Turkey, which hopes the NATO meeting will showcase its modernity and aspirations to join the European Union, has invested close to $40 million to spruce up the parks and streets of Istanbul and to provide security. Officials have said that ships carrying hazardous cargo will be banned from the normally busy Bosporus shipping lane that divides Istanbul into Asian and European sectors. Parts of the center city, on the European side where the bus explosion occurred, will be sealed off. Public transportation will be rerouted or shut down in some areas, and many government offices and factories will be closed. Last November, Istanbul was rocked by four truck-bomb attacks in five days. Two synagogues, the British Consulate and the headquarters of the HSBC bank were hit, and the British consul general was killed. The government has charged 69 people in connection with those bombings, which it said were the work of Muslim terrorists linked to Al Qaeda. The Turkish authorities have elaborate plans to cordon off a large swath of central Istanbul for the NATO meeting, restricting access to the perpetually busy Taksim Square and closing roads along the Bosporus waterway while European leaders and Mr. Bush are here. More than 20,000 police officers are to be deployed during the gathering, many businesses have announced they may close because their employees may have trouble getting to work and security officials have banned the sale of toy guns and remote-controlled toys, like model airplanes."
"A natural-gas explosion blew off the back of a two-story apartment building in Brooklyn yesterday morning, leaving a resident fighting for his life and the shattered dwelling looking like a charred dollhouse. The Fire Department said six firefighters suffered minor injuries fighting the two-alarm blaze, which crumpled the ceiling, buckled floors and shattered the windows of the apartment house, at 94 Harman Street in Bushwick. The resident who was injured, a middle-aged man whose name was not available, was listed in extremely critical condition with life-threatening burns over most of his body. Al Asencio, 38, a construction worker who lives nearby, said the fireball shook the entire neighborhood and stripped a nearby tree of its leaves. The back of the building, which faces a vacant lot on Greene Street, glowed with small fires and burning fabric, Mr. Asencio said, as neighbors peering through their windows moaned: ''Oh, my God! Oh, my God!'' A preliminary investigation determined that a faulty gas line in a first-floor apartment had caused a leak of natural gas, the Fire Department said. When a resident tried to light a cookstove, the line exploded. Afterward, the Department of Buildings cited the building's owner, Rachel Landau, for five violations, including illegal renovation. Ms. Landau did not return calls seeking comment. Last night, fire officials said that a plumber doing work on the building was unlicensed, and that no permit had been issued for work on the property. The officials would not identify either the plumber or a general contractor in charge of the work, but said the fire marshal would discuss whether criminal charges are to be brought against them with the Brooklyn district attorney. Windows in two adjacent buildings were shattered but still intact. Residents of the nearby buildings, including one that had 11 members of an extended family, reported no serious injuries. Charles Brown, 45, who was in 94 Harman during the explosion, was also lucky. Dressed in a turquoise tunic that read ''Illadelphia'' and a matching do-rag, or head covering, Mr. Brown, a cook, was getting ready to go to work in Manhattan. ''I was looking at my watch and it was 7:15 a.m.,'' Mr. Brown recalled yesterday. ''I got up off the couch to go to the bathroom and fix the rag on my head, and that's when everything just blew up.'' The walls of the bathroom caved in and Mr. Brown found himself trapped but unhurt. ''I had to kick the bathroom door open,'' he said, ''and I got through the front door and that's when I heard the dude in the back screaming and yelling. I kicked his door in and I saw him and he was all burned up.'' Four men lived in the four apartments at 94 Harman. While the men were cordial with one another, Mr. Brown said, none of them knew the others' names. ''The dude,'' Mr. Brown said, ''collapsed right there in the hallway and that's when me and the dude upstairs got him out and got him an ambulance.'' The critically injured man, described by Mr. Brown as in his late 40's, was taken to the Burn Center at New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. The Fire Department said it thought it was he who had tried to light the stove. A spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings said that an inspector had visited 94 Harman on Monday to investigate suspected illegal plumbing work in the basement and other possible violations. But she said that a resident would not allow the inspector to enter."
"When the police arrested him on Saturday, they accused Joseph Rodriguez, a former transit officer, of placing a bomb in the Times Square subway station, causing a blast that injured him minutes after he warned commuters about an impending explosion. That explosion injured an arm, leg and eye. Mr. Rodriguez, 27, was set to be retired on a psychological disability pension two days after the bomb exploded on July 19. Law enforcement officials have suggested that he wanted a courageous act to cap his four-year career with the force, or keep it from ending. Mr. Rodriguez's lawyer, Edgar De Leon, said yesterday in an interview that his client is not guilty of the charges of arson, criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment. He refused to address the question of motive. But if Mr. Rodriguez is found to have built a bomb to create an opportunity for bravery, his case would appear to be an anomaly. While there are no known scientific studies on ''hero syndrome'' crimes, experts say that police officers are involved in such crimes less often than firefighters and security guards. They also say that it is rare to find a case in which a bomb exploded, injuring the person who allegedly set it. Jim Wright, a former profiler with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said that he has not come across a case of a police officer intentionally detonating a bomb for glory in more than 30 years of studying violent offenders. The closest example that he could think of related to an officer -- whom Mr. Wright refused to identify, or name the city he served -- who was accused of firing a gun at his patrol car's windshield, then claiming that a suspect shot at him. ''I'm not aware of a case similar to the one at hand,'' said Mr. Wright, a senior analyst with the Threat Assessment Group, a company involved in preventing workplace violence. Mr. Wright's supervisor, Dr. Park Dietz, a renowned forensic psychiatrist, said that most so-called vanity crimes that are known to experts are committed by security guards. ''In a given year,'' he said, ''we see 10 security guard cases; 3 law enforcement cases; 3 firefighter cases, and 4 hospital cases.'' The scenarios vary. Dr. Dietz recalled a grocery store security guard who had contaminated produce in order to discover the contamination. There have also been cases of vandalism and of fake bombs made of clay and wires. Psychiatrists agree that there is no clear profile of a person likely to create havoc in order to help people avoid it. Medical professionals -- such as Charles Cullen, the nurse who confessed to killing 16 people while on duty at hospitals in Pennsylvania and New Jersey -- tend to act out of a need to feel powerful, psychiatrists say; others do it for fear of losing a job or to exact vengeance. A 2003 federal study of at least 75 firefighters who have committed arson found that most of them had a simpler reason -- because they wanted the excitement of putting out a blaze. The arsonists were usually new to the profession, with about three years experience, and they tended to be volunteers rather than full-time paid employees. They were interested in fire service ''for excitement, not for the sake of public service,'' the report stated. Michael Rustigan, a criminologist at San Francisco State University, said that most self-created heroes are narcissists in a slump. They are typically people ''who are not able to achieve their aspirations,'' he said. ''They've fallen down, and they now want to be heroes.'' He added, ''They are a manifestation of our culture's obsession with fame.'' Dr. Alfredo Nudman, head of the personality disorder unit at Weill Cornell Center of New York-Presbyterian Hospital, said that public, self-created acts of bravery have often been the result of earlier claims to greatness. ''They go around boasting about themselves and brag about what they do,'' he said. ''Then people start to notice that they're a fake, so they have to up the ante to be recognized.''"
"At least seven people, including at least two Americans, were killed Sunday when a powerful bomb exploded outside the compound of an American contractor helping to train the Afghan police. A spokesman for the International Security and Assistance Force in Kabul, Squad Leader Peter Maskell, said a second bomb had been found next to the explosion site and had been defused by French explosives experts. The bombing comes just 40 days before presidential elections, scheduled for Oct. 9, and after warnings that the Taliban and other militant groups were planning major attacks in Kabul before the elections. It is the deadliest attack in Kabul since September 2002, when 26 civilians died in a car bombing. American and Afghan officials say the building attacked Sunday was used by DynCorp Inc., which provides security for President Hamid Karzai and also has a contract to train the police force. The building also included some residences, the officials said. In a telephone interview, a Taliban spokesman, Latif Hakimi, claimed responsibility for the attack, on what he called an American base involved in reconstruction. He also promised more attacks, saying, ''Lots of Taliban mujahedeen have entered Kabul, and we will explode more bombs.'' Western diplomats have sought to increase pressure on Pakistan in recent days because of concern that Taliban fighters have found sanctuary there, making it easier for them to plan and execute attacks. Mr. Karzai's office said two Americans, three Nepalese and two Afghans, including a child, had been killed. Nick Downie, the security coordinator for the Afghanistan NGO Security Office, who was among the first at the site, estimated that four American DynCorp employees, three or four Afghans, and three Nepalese Gurkhas providing security for DynCorp had been killed. Several other people were seriously wounded. ''The president understands that as the people of Afghanistan move toward elections, the enemies of Afghanistan will expedite their efforts to harm the election process and threaten the people's security and prosperity,'' the statement from President Karzai's office said. ''However, Afghanistan will continue relentlessly on the path that the people of this country have chosen: the path of peace, prosperity and reconstruction.'' The bomb went off around 5:45 p.m., shattering glass blocks away and sending a huge black plume into the Kabul sky. Fifteen minutes later, a fire raged at the site, and at least two bodies were visible in the street -- one almost a block from the explosion site. DynCorp employees wearing bulletproof vests and carrying automatic weapons fanned out in the street, tending to the wounded and pushing back spectators. Lutfullah Mashaal, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said the engine of some kind of truck had been found 300 meters away. He said it appeared likely that the attack was a suicide bombing because DynCorp security usually prohibits anyone from stopping in front of the house. Mr. Hakimi, however, insisted that the bomber had survived. In a separate incident, eight children and one adult died in an explosion in a madrasa in Paktia Province on Saturday night. Mr. Hakimi insisted that the Taliban were not responsible for that attack, however. Afghan and American military officials said they were still investigating the cause of the explosion. The bombing in Kabul followed a period of relative quiet in the city. A bombing in June 2003 killed four German peacekeepers, and in January 2004 a suicide attack killed a Canadian peacekeeper. But despite repeated warnings, discoveries of explosives caches and multiple attacks on aid workers and contractors outside Kabul, the international civilian representatives in the capital have been largely immune from attack, until Sunday. The blast, Mr. Downie said, moved armored vehicles parked in front of the compound and sent body and vehicle parts flying 70 yards. Explosives experts on his staff estimated that more than 200 pounds of explosives had been used, he said. He also noted the heavy security DynCorp employed at the compound, including Gurkhas posted at both ends of the street. He said it had appeared that the bombing was either a ''suicide attack or a Trojan horse that got past some very good security on that street.'' The compound is on a crowded, affluent residential area, Shar-e-Nau, which has become home to many international organizations and guesthouses for their employees. ''This blast occurred on the front doorstep,'' Mr. Downie said. The carnage would probably have been worse, DynCorp employees told him, had a number of people not left for dinner shortly before. DynCorp officials could not be reached for comment on the bombing. Mr. Downie said that attacks had been forecast as the elections came closer, and that in recent days ''we focused much more on this.'' In the last 24 hours, his security group, the United Nations and the International Security and Assistance Force in Kabul had issued specific suicide bomb attack warnings. Mr. Maskell, the security force spokesman, said the force and Afghan security forces had found a number of explosives in recent weeks, and would continue to work to prevent attacks. Mr. Downie's advice to the many nongovernmental organizations in Kabul employing foreign nationals was ''to basically hibernate'' and step up security around their compounds. ''We've seen what we predicted,'' he said. ''We'll see what ISAF and the security forces in and out of Kabul can do to prevent this from happening again, but personally I can't say I'm optimistic.'' THE REACH OF WAR: AFGHANISTAN"
"SOLDIERS and police brigades patrol the island, placing bridges and train stations under machine-gun surveillance. Coast Guard vessels scour the harbor for enemy craft, while rumors of intruders with hard-to-pronounce names sweep through the city. Haunted by a recent act of sabotage, the largest ever on America soil, New Yorkers live in a state of high alert. That was New York in the summer of 1917, months after America entered World War I. A year earlier, German agents had detonated an enormous munitions depot at Black Tom, a small island near the Statue of Liberty. Shock waves from the explosion blew out windows in downtown Manhattan, made the Brooklyn Bridge sway and gave dreadful confirmation to fears that saboteurs were at large in the city. If this all has a queasily familiar ring to New Yorkers in the summer of 2004, as the city awaits both the Republican National Convention and the third anniversary of the attacks of Sept. 11, there is some comfort in knowing the city has been here before. In fact, New York has been on the defensive many times over the last several centuries. The very qualities that have made it America's premier city have marked it as a target to foreign antagonists. ''We New Yorkers enjoy the benefits of living in one of the world's greatest and richest cities,'' Mayor Fiorello La Guardia said in 1943. ''War makes us a natural aim of the enemy.'' The point was made more succinctly on the cover of a pamphlet distributed by the city's Office of Civil Defense in 1952, as America braced for atomic war with the Soviet Union. ''Target No.1'' read the copy, with an arrow pointing to a small dot identified as ''New York City.'' It was an ominous graphic, but accompanying it was a consoling message: ''You can SURVIVE.'' Exactly how New Yorkers have survived enemy attacks, or, rather, planned to survive them, since few have actually occurred, has evolved. Every American conflict, from the Revolutionary War to the war on terrorism, has added new dimensions to the threat, each demanding new defenses. Early efforts to defend New York were not auspicious -- both the Dutch and colonial Americans lost the city to the British -- but in the 19th century New York became among the world's most invincible cities. Defending New York in those days was a fairly simple proposition. Manhattan was surrounded by water, so invasion was certain to come by sea. A dozen well-armed battlements scattered around the harbor, from Castle Clinton at the island's southern tip to Fort Hamilton at the edge of the Narrows, made the success of any such invasion highly improbable. But invincibility led to complacency, and by the 20th century New York's defense system had fallen into obsolescence. The outbreak of World War I in Europe served as a jarring wake-up call. As one defense expert, Otto Luyties, worried aloud to The New York Times in 1916, the city's 19th-century forts would be useless against 20th-century guns. Nothing in New York's arsenal could prevent an enemy navy from lobbing one-ton shells into the city from as far away as Rockaway Beach. ''Manhattan Island cannot move and is a very large target,'' Mr. Luyties said. ''They could not miss it.'' World War I also raised newer, more contemporary fears, chief among them that German U-boats might steal into the harbor and wreak havoc on the city. The U-boat problem was effectively solved by a happy combination of ingenuity and geography. The Navy strung a steel net across the mile-wide Verrazano Narrows, extending from Brooklyn to Staten Island and from the water's surface to the bottom of the sea, effectively shutting the mouth of the harbor. A longer, sturdier version of the net was revised for World War II, this time stretching from Coney Island to Sandy Hook. Once again the net sealed the harbor, but it did nothing to prevent four German agents from landing in Amagansett, on Long Island, in the summer of 1942. The men paddled to shore from a U-boat, walked to the Long Island Rail Road station and boarded the train to New York. Before they could strike, one of the men confessed and gave up the others. All were sentenced to death. ''A more sensible, and much simpler way to get saboteurs into this country,'' The New Yorker suggested in 1945, deploying what is arguably the best response to a dangerous situation -- a sense of humor -- ''would be to parachute them down into Bryant Park at high noon, in fancy clothes, from a plane trailing a streamer advertising a Broadway show. The cops would chalk it up to press-agentry, and [the spies] could walk away and proceed to the serious business of blowing up the Kensico Dam and releasing the lions from the zoo.'' Air raids of a less fanciful kind had long been a concern to the city's protectors. As early as the mid-1920's, despite peace abroad and the fact that an airplane had yet to cross the Atlantic, the National Guard prepared to defend Manhattan against enemy air strikes, going so far, one summer evening in 1926, as to stage a mock air battle 3,000 feet over Times Square. By the 40's, air raids were no longer theoretical. The specter of bombs raining from the sky added yet another terrifying dimension to the array of threats facing New York. Air raids put civilian populations at risk as never before, and made a sound civil defense as crucial as military might. La Guardia's administration mobilized a force of 432,000 New Yorkers, comprising one out of 11 adults. In the event of an attack, 428 sirens would wail, galvanizing a massive response coordinated by the City-Wide Control Center. In a city with 150,000 streetlights operated by 32,000 switches, simply turning off the lights for a blackout required a mind-boggling effort. AS for those unfortunate citizens caught outside during an air raid, ''suitable buildings have been selected, into which the public can go to escape flying debris or shrapnel,'' one report advised. ''The entrances to these buildings have been marked with 'Cover' signs.'' It was a testament to La Guardia's faith in the cool wits of New Yorkers that he expected them to peruse the neighborhood for ''Cover'' signs while dodging flying debris. But one truism of civil defense is that the greater the danger, the more amusing the plan seems in retrospect. By this measure, the Cold War was a laugh riot. There wasn't much to be done to prepare the city against an atomic bomb in the 50's, but this hardly discouraged the city's Office of Civil Defense. Even while carrying out such alarming preparations as requiring school children to wear dog tags -- all the better to identify their remains in the event of an attack -- the city distributed pamphlets filled with helpful, mom-like hints. ''Dress properly,'' it advised. ''Always wear a hat -- the brim may save you a serious face burn.'' And, most importantly, ''Be careful not to track radioactive materials into the house.'' Easy to laugh now. Or not so easy. Since 9/11, yet another dimension has been added to the threat against the city, one so insidious it can make a 21st-century New Yorker yearn for the good old days of Nazi saboteurs. Someday, the phrase ''If You See Something, Say Something'' will sound as quaint as ''Loose Lips Sink Ships.'' Meanwhile, it never hurts to wear a hat.

"An explosion inside a trailer in downtown Hackensack, N.J., yesterday frightened passers-by and caused heavy damage to several stores, the police said. The trailer, which was behind a row of stores on Main Street, near Bergen Street, contained a gas grill and several 20-gallon propane tanks, the police said. The cause of the blast, which happened shortly before 11 a.m., was under investigation last night. ''Right now, it looks like this is a propane explosion,'' Detective Capt. Frank Lomia of the Hackensack Police Department said. ''We're not calling it suspicious, but we are keeping our options open.'' The police would not identify the owner of the trailer. No injuries were reported, but the explosion shattered windows, collapsed at least one exterior wall and damaged buildings within a one-block radius, the police said. The blast could be felt a mile away. ''It felt like an earthquake, a small earthquake,'' said Monica Samuels, 27, who was on Main Street at the time of the blast. ''It was incredibly frightening.'' The most seriously damaged businesses were a delicatessen, a nail salon, a law office and a Chinese restaurant, the police said. ''We got a lot of damage that we're still sifting through back there,'' Captain Lomia said."
"In late June, just two weeks into his tour here, Pvt. Jeremy Kretz from Dubuque, Iowa, was driving in a convoy near the border with Pakistan when a remote-controlled explosion hit his Humvee, causing him to black out and blasting him and his companions with rocks and dust. The American soldiers got away with concussions, ruptured eardrums and gravel-peppered skin. ''Head's pretty full of gravel anyway,'' joked his commander, Lt. James Avrams, who is in charge of the protection force at Gardez, raising a laugh among his men, all from the 34th Infantry Division, Iowa National Guard. But for the American military, and foreign and Afghan officials, remote-controlled explosions have become the biggest threat in Afghanistan. Although they are not being used on nearly the scale found in Iraq, they are becoming more common and increasingly sophisticated, military and other officials said in interviews. That point was driven home over the weekend of Aug. 7, when two American soldiers and an Afghan interpreter were killed, and three more men were wounded, south of here by a powerful explosion that tossed their Humvee over and over in the air. The explosion was not only set off by remote control, probably with a radio set, but also was a ''daisy chain'' explosion, with explosives laid along the road and linked, to ensure a lethal blow. Twelve election workers have been killed in explosions over the last few months as they have registered voters nationwide. Thirty-one American soldiers have been killed -- 23 of them in combat -- this year, most of them in roadside explosions or ambushes, a sharp increase over the same period last year. In the first week of August, the Gardez team recorded an incident every day, whether a clash with fighters suspected of being members of the Taliban or Al Qaeda, or explosions aimed at American forces or supply trucks, Lt. Evan McCrann said. Lieutenant Avrams said, ''We are expecting it to get worse.'' In the period leading to Afghanistan's presidential elections, which are scheduled for Oct. 9, in which President Hamid Karzai is facing 22 challengers, United States troops have been ordered to make the election process, and security for the elections, their priority. It will be a combined effort, with American conventional and Special Forces going after insurgents, often with help from the newly trained Afghan National Army. Civil affairs teams will travel the regions to extend the government's reach and deliver assistance, and the Afghan police will provide security for election officials and voting sites. The American-led coalition forces now number about 20,000, and are spread across the troubled southern and eastern parts of the country. They will provide the backbone of the security effort, even if the Afghan services appear in the forefront. The ''bad guys,'' as the soldiers call the suspected Taliban and foreign Al Qaeda fighters along with other groups opposed to the American presence in Afghanistan and to the American-backed election process, remain active along the eastern border with Pakistan, and across southern Afghanistan. United States marines and Special Forces have been brought into specific areas on request to tackle known troublemakers or groups of insurgents. Civil affairs teams, based in provincial centers, have their own protection units, which also conduct regular patrols and security operations. For one such team in Gardez, the threat of improvised explosive devices, or I.E.D.'s as they are known, is one of the most difficult to combat. ''They tell us to watch out for stacks of rocks, but there's stacks of rocks everywhere here,'' said Jon, a sergeant who spoke on the condition that his surname not be published. Specialist Leo Pins added: ''Or watch for wires, but when you are rolling down the road with lots of dust, you don't see much. You drive down and pray.'' And Specialist Toby Handy said, ''Just hope you don't go boom.'' The sergeant added: ''It's also frustrating. It's hard to find the guys trying to do the things against us.'' The danger and fear are even greater for government and election officials and aid workers, who do not have the protection of armored vehicles or body armor but have increasingly been the targets of attacks this year. The attacks that have been most shocking to people here have been an explosion in a mosque in Ghazni, where voters were registering, and a bomb in a bus carrying women who were going to register voters in Jalalabad, which killed 3 and wounded 10 more. ''The biggest threat to the electoral process is clearly I.E.D.'s,'' said Brian Nelson Smith, the regional security officer for the election commission. Yet most of the people interviewed here who were involved in preparing for the elections agreed that unless the Taliban, the remnants of the former rulers of Afghanistan, made major changes in tactics, the explosions would not prevent or seriously disrupt the election. The voter registration campaign has created strong momentum for the election, they say. ''They are going to do what they can, but they are not going to stop the process,'' said Maj. William Renaldo, deputy commander of the American civil affairs team in Gardez. He pointed to the example of Paktika Province, one of the most dangerous parts of the country, which runs along the Pakistani border and has been almost a free zone for Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters in the last two years. The provincial governor has made a major push, backed by the United Nations and a substantial American-led coalition force, to win over the tribes and start reconstruction. As a result, registration has progressed across the province, he said. The Taliban are not powerful enough to go against the wishes of the tribal leaders, he said. A spokesman for the Taliban, Abdul Latif Hakimi, claimed responsibility in a telephone interview for recent remote-controlled explosions against American forces, but denied involvement in the Ghazni mosque bombing. Mr. Hakimi said there would be more attacks. The weak link in the country's security remains the local Afghan police. In southeastern Afghanistan, the police are so poorly equipped and understaffed that the tribes have assembled their own militia forces in the last two years. Now the officers of an American-led program are scrambling to train and equip the local police in time for the elections. In Gardez, they have been delivering vehicles and radios to the police in the region, but cannot provide them with needed weapons or ammunition. ''They are having a real hard time,'' Major Renaldo said of the local police. ''They have no weapons. They are not in very good shape.'' THE REACH OF WAR: ATTACKS"
"A former New York City police officer charged with setting off an explosive in a Times Square subway station has been determined mentally fit to stand trial, despite his lawyer's claims that he remains deeply traumatized from the explosion and the events of Sept. 11. The former officer, Joseph Rodriguez, 27, pleaded not guilty to second-degree arson and other charges at his arraignment in State Supreme Court in Manhattan yesterday afternoon, wearing a neck brace and dark glasses and still recovering from his injuries from the pipe bomb explosion on July 19, his lawyer said. The blast, on the mezzanine leading to the A, C and E lines at the 42nd Street station, sent pellets flying, but the damage was limited to pocks in the wall tiles, and the only injury was to Mr. Rodriguez, his lawyer, Edgar De Leon, said in court. Justice Micki A. Scherer ordered Mr. Rodriguez held in $200,000 bond, which his lawyer said he expected to produce today with the deed to a Brooklyn building owned by the officer's uncle. Several of Mr. Rodriguez's relatives and his girlfriend left the court in silence after the arraignment. No trial date was set. Mr. Rodriguez was an officer for four years, but had been on modified duty, without a gun, from late 2001. He had been given a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from the attack on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, when he ran to the burning towers. Witnesses recalled that he had had an injured knee and seemed almost catatonic by that day's end, and he spent the next several weeks at his home on Mulberry Street in Little Italy. He was assigned to desk duty at the transit bureau in the 42nd Street station when the pipe bomb exploded, and was to leave the Police Department the next day on a forced disability retirement. In the moments after the explosion, during the evening rush, he was lauded as a hero for telling people to stand back, but a prosecutor said yesterday that he had faked being thrown down a flight of stairs from the force of the blast. Two of his fingerprints were found on the bomb, said Lanita Hobbs, an assistant district attorney. According to police reports detailing his statements filed by the Manhattan district attorney's office, Mr. Rodriguez spoke of the bomb while he was in the back of the ambulance that took him to a hospital that night, telling a paramedic he had found it and repeating that claim to a doctor. Later that night, Mr. Rodriguez told detectives that he had gone out for an iced coffee when he noticed an unattended plastic bag. ''At first, I paid it no mind,'' he told investigators the night of the blast, according to the police report. After a small explosion, the bag caught fire, and Mr. Rodriguez told investigators that he told one woman, ''Don't go that way,'' according to the report. But the officer gave varying accounts of where he had found the bag, whether it had been smoking or burning, and where he had been standing, the prosecutor said. Mr. Rodriguez retired with a disability pension, which he stands to lose if convicted, his lawyer said."
"The Indonesian police said Friday that they believed that at least two, and possibly three, suicide bombers were in a van that exploded outside the Australian Embassy here on Thursday, killing nine Indonesians and wounding more than 180 people. The police showed a photograph that they said was taken by a security camera of a white van outside the Australian Embassy 29 seconds before the explosion. At a news conference, the police also told how they had followed but lost the trail of three men over the last several months who were carrying explosives and who had written letters saying they were willing to commit suicide in a terror attack. The head of the police forensic unit, Suyitno Landung, said the police could not yet determine whether those three men were in the van on Thursday. Immediately after the attack, the police said that the radical Islamic group Jemaah Islamiyah was responsible and that the bombing bore great similarities to others by the group. In Australia, Prime Minister John Howard said, based on information from the Indonesian police, that more attacks could not be ruled out. But it was not clear whether Mr. Howard was referring to the possibility that the three men trailed by the police were still at large. ''The information they have available indicates that the number of operatives is sufficiently large to support the fear that there could be another attack,'' Mr. Howard said. As a jittery Jakarta tried to resume normal life on Friday, people expressed anger at the authorities for not stopping the third terror attack in less than two years, and newspaper editorials called for the death penalty for the attackers. A gardener who worked at the Australian Embassy, Suryadi, 34, was buried just after noon among a grove of frangipani trees at the back of his home in South Jakarta. His wife, Yuyut, who sat on the porch of their home clasping framed photographs of the couple on their wedding day, said that Mr. Suryadi had loved his job at the embassy because he ''loved plants.'' He felt privileged, she said, that he was allowed to bring his family to the embassy grounds on weekends, where their 5-year-old son, Sedri, could swim in the pool. At hotels in the city center, security forces opened trunks and hoods on vehicles before they were allowed to enter driveways, and pocketbooks and briefcases were inspected at hotel entrances. New concrete barriers surrounded the British Embassy. At the United States Embassy, officials said they were renewing their request to the authorities to build a higher, more crash-proof perimeter wall. The police indicated that they had made some headway in the investigation. According to a report in an online Indonesian news service, Detik, the police said they had arrested six men in the last few months who had signed letters to commit suicide. In the news conference, Mr. Suyitno said that the police had gleaned information in contacts between these men and associates still at large. Mr. Suyitno said that two major suspects, Noordin Moh Top and Azahari Husin, who are senior members of Jemaah Islamiyah and known as sophisticated bomb makers, had recruited men to become suicide bombers. Mr. Azahari, a Malaysian with a British university degree, is known to have trained in explosives in Afghanistan in the 1990's. Jemaah Islamiyah has also been held responsible for the terror attacks in Bali in 2002, when 202 people died, and at the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta last August when 12 people were killed. Earlier Friday, the Australian foreign minister, Alexander Downer, said the Indonesian police received a mobile phone text message 45 minutes before the bomb blast on Thursday morning. According to Mr. Downer, the message said there would be a terror attack unless the leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, Abu Bakar Bashir, was released from jail. But Mr. Suyitno said at the news conference that the account by Mr. Downer was ''not true.''"
"The city's deputy fire chief was killed in a seemingly unremarkable house fire here early Friday morning after he roused all 15 occupants to safety. The deputy chief, James D'Heron, 51, was the senior firefighter on duty and the first to respond when an alarm was phoned in about the fire in a two-family rental property at Lee Avenue and Suydam Street at 3:03 a.m. Friday. Chief D'Heron is believed to have reached the scene in about one minute, Mayor James M. Cahill said. Other firefighters arrived about three minutes later and found all 15 residents safe outside, and Chief D'Heron lying dead on the landing between the first and second floors inside, the mayor said. Authorities were investigating reports of an explosion at the house, but the cause of death has not yet been determined. The authorities would not say whether there were any burns on Chief D'Heron's body. He was not wearing his full safety gear, which Mayor Cahill said was normal for the commander at the scene of a fire. The mayor said he expected that there would be an autopsy and that the fire investigation report would be completed soon. Chief D'Heron had grown up with many of the leaders of this university city on the Raritan River -- the mayor graduated from St. Peter's High School in 1970, a year behind Chief D'Heron -- and city leaders took the death hard. ''Jim D'Heron has been a friend of mine since high school,'' the mayor said through tears at a news conference on Friday afternoon. ''He was a firefighter's firefighter, a skilled leader and a beloved officer.'' The home was typical of thousands in old cities in New Jersey and the region -- a modest family home on a street that has seen better days, cut into apartments that are occupied by large numbers of mostly Spanish-speaking residents and, in New Brunswick's case, students from Rutgers University here. Thirteen of the 15 people living in the burned house were adults, the mayor said, and two were children, age 7 and 2. The Red Cross was helping them find housing on Friday. The mayor said three propane tanks were taken from inside the house Friday, but none had exploded. Robert McLaughlin, director of the city's Fire Department, said it was illegal to store propane tanks indoors. ''But as for explosions and other events, we've heard what you're heard, but we don't know at this point,'' Mayor Cahill told reporters. Earlier Friday afternoon, fire investigators were seen removing other objects from the house -- a charred can of paint, one said, and some electrical gear. The house is owned by a sergeant on the city police force, Victor DeFillippo, and had been inspected several times in recent years with no violations found, Mayor Cahill said at a news conference. Sergeant DeFillippo is cooperating with investigators, the mayor said. The Middlesex County prosecutor's office is also investigating, the mayor said, a normal step in a fatality at a fire. Chief D'Heron was on the force for 22 years and was decorated for bravery in saving lives. He is the fifth firefirefighter to die in New Brunswick since the city's Fire Department was chartered in 1764, the mayor said. Chief D'Heron is survived by his wife, Kathleen, and three grown children: a daughter, Erin Varga, and sons Nicky, an Army military policeman, and Jimmy. ''Everyone loved Jim,'' said Mr. McLaughlin, the Fire Department director, ''and no one loved him more than us, the officers and senior staff of the department.'' Small knots of people watched fire investigators at the building on Friday afternoon. The front hall and upstairs window showed evidence of the fire, but given that it cost the life of a man the house seemed only moderately damaged. A man who lived nearby, Al Patterson III, 34, a retail worker, brought his 9-year-old daughter Evelyn down to see the burned house she had seen earlier on television. ''I wanted her to see up close with her own eyes that however many firefighters sacrificed their lives on 9/11, even in a small town like New Brunswick, they give their lives without a thought, also,'' Mr. Patterson said."
"An electrical fire under a street near the Port Authority Bus Terminal yesterday set off explosions that sent heavy manhole covers more than 10 feet into the air, injuring five people and disrupting rush-hour traffic. The explosions occurred on 38th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues shortly after 6 p.m. The blast shattered storefronts and caused panicked people nearby to run for cover. ''It was the loudest thing I ever heard,'' said Pete Vassil, a musician who was walking on 38th Street when the explosions started. ''I didn't know if it was another terrorist attack.'' The authorities said that one police officer suffered injuries from smoke inhalation and four civilians had minor injuries from flying debris, and that all were treated at nearby hospitals. The cause of the fire and explosions remained unclear last night. The blaze, which drew a large response from the police, firefighters and Con Edison emergency workers, was contained by 8:30 p.m., the authorities said, but a loud buzz could still be heard on the street last night from electrical wires apparently still burning underground. The police closed off parts of Eighth Avenue to cars for a few hours. Brenda Perez, a Con Ed spokeswoman, said five manhole covers were sent flying. Some off them landed more than 25 feet away. The block where the explosions erupted is lined with storefronts and offices used mainly by the Manhattan garment industry. Although it is two blocks south of the Port Authority Bus Terminal, pedestrian traffic to the terminal was not greatly impaired."
"On the fourth day of her nightmare, Marianna Winchester welcomed dozens more friends and acquaintances on Monday who spoke of her son, Ronald, 25, a first lieutenant with the United States Marine Corps, in the past tense. Life has seemed surreal for Mrs. Winchester since two marines and a priest came to her home on Friday to tell her that her son, her older child, was killed a day earlier when a roadside bomb exploded as his unit traveled on foot outside Baghdad. Three other marines were also killed in the explosion. ''No, my son is not dead,'' she remembered saying when they told her about the explosion. ''My son is dead?'' On Monday, wearing a shirt that said, ''May God bless our country and everyone who defends her,'' she sat in a living room lined with dozens of photos of her son, Ronald Dominick Winchester, who was only eight days into his second tour of duty in Iraq when he was killed. In one photo, as a young boy, he protectively hugged his younger sister, Kristine. A woman came in with a blond toddler who scampered up the hallway stairs, toward Ron's bedroom, which the family had once jokingly called the Shrine. (What should she do with all his military memorabilia, she had asked Ronnie. Put it in the Shrine, she said he said, and save it for when I can tell my children about Iraq.) Family and close friends came in the side door at the kitchen, where Kristine, 23, removed plastic wrap from deli trays. She had slept in a T-shirt that said, ''Marines Rule Because,'' followed by a litany of reasons in small print. Mrs. Winchester's husband was out at a church, making arrangements for a memorial service. Lieutenant Winchester was an offensive lineman in his football career at Chaminade High School in Mineola and at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, which he graduated from in 2001. It was so typical of Ronnie -- so much a leader, so much an offensive lineman -- that he would be expected to be out in front of his unit when the mine detonated, his family and friends said. ''Did he suffer?'' Mrs. Winchester asked on Monday. ''Everyone tells me no. They gave him morphine. I wondered what part of him was injured. I imagine it was his legs, because when you're stepping on a mine, naturally. '' Her voice broke off. Then, in the den, Mrs. Winchester showed a visitor a drawing that was a favorite of her son's. It showed a firefighter amid the rubble of the World Trade Center, handing an American flag to a marine, who says ''I'll take it from here.'' She said her son was a hero, and that he died for ''all of us.'' ''Never once did he say something negative about the war, Bush or anyone else,'' she added. She held printed copies of her last e-mail messages from her son, dated last Tuesday. She had read them over and over in the past two days. She said that reading between the lines, she knew that he knew something was different about this tour. She had felt as much during his last few weeks at home, when he sat around the house, just relaxing, not doing too much. She would ask: ''Are you bored?'' And her son would reply: '''No, I just want to chill.''' In the messages, Lieutenant Winchester wrote of the ominous and the mundane. It was hot, and his body was adjusting slowly. ''The Arabs are getting better,'' he wrote. ''I pray I don't lose any limbs or come home at all. We shoot at everything and anything that digs. How is papa and poochie? I am writing you on my AOL account so don't cancel it. Send small packages. Don't need anything yet. Will need Head and Shoulders shampoo, small bottles of it. Also Gatorade mix, fruit punch. Tell Kris to send pictures.'' He signed it, ''Love, Ron.'' Lieutenant Winchester's maternal grandfather, Dominick Gatta, 81, known as papa, who enlisted in the Marines and served in the Pacific during World War II, stood in the den and sobbed. ''May God strike me dead, I never said, 'Ronnie, you've got to be a marine,''' Mr. Gatta said, breaking into sobs again. He led a visitor to his home next door, which was decorated with photos of colonels, generals, saints and Lieutenant Winchester. The blanket the Marines issued Mr. Gatta when he joined in 1940 covered his bed, and in a den, photos of him as a star boxer in the Marines covered a wall. Mrs. Winchester said she told her father to be strong; she could bury only one at a time. Outside Annapolis, some 200 miles south, Shari Marra, whom Mrs. Winchester called her son's second mother, also grieved. Ms. Marra, who works in the athletic department at the Naval Academy, was Lieutenant Winchester's sponsor. For four years, she had fed and occasionally sheltered him and had done his laundry, as part of a program for out-of-town students. ''Why are we over there? What are we doing?'' she said, weeping over the phone. She described how Annapolis's football community was reeling from the loss. She had sent Lieutenant Winchester an instant message the day before his death, and she had admonished him to be careful. ''I see these boys come and go and I know this is what they want to do, what they would do,'' she said. ''But it's the biggest loss. I don't know how any of us are going to get over it.''"
"North Korea will show foreign diplomats as early as Tuesday the site of a mysterious explosion that it said was intended to blow up a mountain for a hydroelectric dam, British journalists reported Monday night from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. Satellite photos of a mushroom cloud rising Thursday from a huge nighttime explosion raised international concern that North Korea had tested a nuclear bomb on Sept. 9, the 56th anniversary of its founding. There have been no reports of increased radiation releases from North Korea's neighbors, China, Russia or South Korea. ''It was no nuclear explosion or an accident,'' said North Korea's foreign minister, Paek Nam Sun, according to a BBC correspondent in Pyongyang who was traveling with Bill Rammell, a minister with the British Foreign Office. ''It was a deliberate, controlled detonation to demolish a mountain in the far north of the country.'' The Press Association of Britain gave similar details about the explosion in a pool report, and the official New China News Agency quoted a North Korean Foreign Ministry official as giving an identical explanation. In a pool report received by Reuters, Mr. Rammell said the British ambassador in Pyongyang, David Slinn, could visit the site near the Chinese border as early as Tuesday. North Korea's first mention of the incident came four days after the blast, in reaction to what it called a South Korean ''smear campaign'' about a possible a nuclear test. ''Plot-breeders might tell such a sheer lie,'' the Korean Central News Agency said Monday. Referring to South Korea's admissions about its own experiments with nuclear fuels, the agency said, ''The story about the explosion is nothing but a sheer fabrication intended to divert elsewhere the world public attention focused on the nuclear-related issue of South Korea.'' But many South Koreans voiced skepticism about a nighttime explosion in a military area known to have a ballistic missile base. Officials here are studying the topography of the blast site for evidence that there is river large enough to support a major hydroelectric project. Generally, construction engineers avoid blasting at night, partly for safety reasons and partly because extensive lighting is usually needed, a luxury in power-starved North Korea. Hours after the blast, a two-mile-high cloud was traced to a site in Kimhyongjik County, about 20 miles from China. The thinly populated county has the rugged topography needed for hydroelectric projects. Last week, Reuters reported, North Korean television showed images of bulldozers moving earth at a mountain site for what it said would be a hydroelectric power plant, about 40 miles east of the reported explosion. Last May, North Korea's news agency reported that construction had started on a power plant in Samsu County, about 50 miles from where the explosion took place. There are as many unanswered questions about the blast as there are about the explosion that leveled a railroad station on April 22, killing 171 people shortly after a train passed carrying North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il. One analyst here said the murkiness surrounding the blast is consonant with North Korea's studied ambiguity about its nuclear program. ''Taking into consideration North Korea's strategies -- brinkmanship diplomacy and strategic ambiguity when dealing with the U.S. -- I think this incident was in line with their usual tactics,'' Kim Tae Woo, a nuclear policy specialist at the Korean Institute of Defense Analysis, a government-financed research center, said Monday. ''It was a way to send out the message and boast that they can stage such a large-scale explosion if they wanted to.'' In what was perhaps another message, Mr. Rammell, the British Foreign Office minister, said North Korean officials had told him during his four-day visit that they were committed to continuing six-party talks on their nuclear weapons program with South Korea, the United States, Japan, Russia and China, but ''weren't prepared to commit to a date,'' Reuters reported."
