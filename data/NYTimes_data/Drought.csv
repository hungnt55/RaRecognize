"It's dry out there. Despite some scattered sprinkles yesterday, the New York metropolitan region has not had rainfall of any consequence since the end of summer. New York City has already had the amount of water it is allowed to draw from three Catskill reservoirs reduced by nearly a third, smoke from stubborn fall wildfires in South Jersey closed several schools this week, and the New York State apple crop is smaller than normal because of the lack of rain. And homeowners who can remember where they planted flower bulbs for next spring should think about watering those spots before the ground freezes, agricultural experts say, or they will be disappointed in March. ''It's abnormally dry,'' said Peter Gabrielsen, deputy regional hydrologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's eastern region, ''and it has been impacting mostly in New York, in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and out on Long Island.'' Forecasters, agronomists and hydrologists are not yet calling the extended dry spell a drought, because it is normal for the skies to stay clear and stream levels to fall during the early autumn. The test of whether the current dry spell turns into the kind of extended drought that hit the region in 1999 and did not end until Hurricane Floyd passed through that September will come around the first of December, they say, when rain and snowfall should begin to restore reservoirs and soil moisture levels. ''It just stopped raining at the end of July, and we've seen a precipitous decline in water levels,'' said Carol Collier, executive director of the Delaware River Basin Commission, which regulates the amount of water municipalities in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania may draw from the river's watershed. ''So right now we've passed through a drought warning to a drought watch, and if we don't receive any precipitation soon, it's likely that we'll be in an actual drought stage by December 1st.'' The commission has reduced New York City's daily allotment from its three reservoirs in the Delaware River watershed to 560 million gallons a day, from an average of 800 million. If an actual drought is declared, the city water budget from the reservoirs -- Cannonsville, Neversink and Pepacton -- will drop to 530 million gallons. While state water and agricultural experts watch the skies for signs of rain, NOAA, using admittedly highly uncertain forecasting models, predicts little relief for the region. Its Climate Predication Center's seasonal drought outlook predicts an improvement in dry conditions in extreme western New York and in New England, but no change for the Mid-Atlantic states through January. The region's near-drought conditions now reach from Chautauqua County in western New York across the state's southern tier of counties and down the Hudson River Valley through Ulster, Orange, Putnam, Rockland and Westchester Counties, south through New Jersey. Long Island and Connecticut are also dry, Mr. Gabrielsen said, but are not yet as badly affected. Gov. George E. Pataki has asked for federal drought designation for 24 New York counties, and 4 more may be added, said Thomas Lindberg, executive assistant to Nathan L. Rudgers, the state agriculture commissioner. The designation helps in obtaining federal relief aid for farmers. Mr. Lindberg said the state estimated that the dry weather had cost farmers about $400 million in lost or diminished crops, compared with a normal year. Apple and Concord grape harvests in western New York have been hurt the most, he added. Otherwise, dry weather helped growers get their crops in, said Jim Willmott, the Camden County, N.J., agent for the Rutgers Cooperative Extension Service. The exceptions are evergreen plants -- holly, fir, pine, rhododendron and the like -- that are in danger of drying out if they are not watered, particularly those that were planted only this year. ''The major concern is that if you have any perennial plants, especially those recently established, this kind of drought can cause damage,'' Mr. Willmott said. Meanwhile, the dry, sunny weather has produced a series of stubborn brush fires in South Jersey that have in some cases managed to burrow underground in the dry soil and escape firefighters' spray. Nearly 100 acres of scrub and woodland have been burned in Cumberland County so far, while smoke from a fire in Salem County prompted officials to close public schools in Pennsville on Tuesday and Wednesday. They have since reopened."
"Faced with a rapidly worsening energy crisis that threatens to cripple Latin America's largest economy, the government ordered consumers and businesses today to cut electricity consumption by 20 percent or prepare for California-style blackouts. The reduction is to be achieved through rationing that will start on June 1 and includes surcharges for those who do not meet their cutback quotas and rewards for those who do. The restrictions are to remain for at least six months, officials said. ''We will save the energy we need if we organize ourselves,'' President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said in a nationally televised speech tonight. ''Everyone has to participate in this national effort if we want to remove the risk of blackouts.'' In an innovative effort to minimize disruption for both industrial and individual users, large companies are to be allowed to sell the energy that they save to others, and small consumers who reduce consumption by 34 percent will receive their electricity free. But with the carrot comes a stick. The power of quota violators will be turned off for up to six days at a time. Initially, the government had envisioned a conservation system based on fines of up to 1,500 percent for those who failed to comply. But a decision was made to ''invert the equation,'' the government's energy crisis coordinator, Pedro Parente, said today, and ''seek the cooperation of society'' by ''rewarding those who are already consuming less and for that reason can't make larger cuts.'' The measures announced today in Brasília fall far short of the rolling blackouts of four to six hours a day that the press has been predicting. Those forecasts had led in recent days to panic buying of candles, generators and flashlights, along with widespread fears that the dimming of street lights would lead to a surge in crime. On Thursday night, street lighting in most major cities was cut 35 percent, and police night shifts were bolstered. In another sign of the seriousness of the crisis, the government has prohibited night games of professional soccer, the country's favorite sport, and severely restricted concerts. The announcement of the mandatory plan had originally been scheduled for next Wednesday, but was moved up to quell growing anger at the government's handling of the crisis. More than 130 million of Brazil's 170 million people will be affected when the rationing begins, including all the residents of the São Paulo-Rio de Janeiro-Brasília triangle, the industrial heartland. The immediate cause of the crisis is the country's worst drought in more than 60 years. More than 90 percent of the electricity in Brazil is generated by dams. But water levels at hydroelectric plants have fallen to less than one-third of capacity as a result of the prolonged dry spell, which has affected even some tributaries of the Amazon. The power shortage also reflects what economists and executives describe as a lack of government investment in power supply that dates from the mid-1980's. Numerous state-owned utilities have been sold to investors, with much of the revenue from those sales used to reduce the government deficit instead of being plowed back into building additional plants. In the 1990's, the demand for electricity grew 45 percent, in part as a result of a successful program to control inflation, an effort that helped millions of poor people buy television sets, refrigerators, air-conditioners and other appliances. But the installed capacity rose by just 28 percent and is now at 74,000 megawatts, according to government estimates. ''This crisis was foreseen in innumerable official technical studies of the supply of energy done over the last five years,'' a newsmagazine, _poca, complained this week. ''But no one in authority got up out of his chair to seek a solution,'' and the government ''opted for successive cuts in the budget of state energy companies to fulfill commitments made to the International Monetary Fund.'' Mr. Parente tried to rebut those contentions today, saying 15 of 21 projects for power plants that were ''paralyzed'' when Mr. Cardoso took office in 1995 have been built. But Finance Minister Pedro Malan acknowledged in a speech on Monday, ''There certainly has been a problem with communication and coordination among various parts of the government.'' The government's biggest concern is that the cutbacks will drive the economy into recession, force layoffs, widen the budget deficit and further weaken the currency, which has hit record lows against the dollar this month. The leading economic research institute predicts that at least 850,000 jobs and $14.6 billion in production will be lost to rationing, an estimate that will rise even further if blackouts are decreed. ''If this program works and water levels are as expected, we will be able to diminish to a minimum the likelihood of a reduction of consumption by means of blackouts,'' Mr. Parente said today. ''But if one of these two factors falls short, then we will have to enact blackouts.''"
"Scios Inc., which was founded in 1981, might have the dubious distinction of being the oldest biotechnology company that has not developed a successful drug. But the company moved closer to ending its drought on Friday when an advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration unanimously recommended approval of its drug for acute congestive heart failure. If given final approval by the F.D.A., the drug, called Natrecor, would be the first new treatment for acute congestive heart failure in more than a decade, according to Scios, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif. Congestive heart failure, in which the heart does not pump enough blood, leading to fluid buildup in the lungs, affects about five million Americans. The Scios drug is intended for the one million flare-ups a year, when a patient is rushed to the hospital barely able to breathe. The F.D.A. usually follows the advice of its advisory panels of outside experts, but not always. Indeed, two years ago, the advisory panel recommended approval for Natrecor, but the F.D.A. rejected the drug, asking for further data comparing Natrecor with intravenous nitroglycerin, the drug commonly used in such cases. The new studies showed that Natrecor could restore blood circulation and reduce lung congestion in as little as 15 minutes, faster than nitroglycerin. Still, there were some concerns expressed at the advisory panel meeting on Friday that Natrecor reduces blood pressure too much in a small percentage of patients. Also, some data suggested that patients treated with Natrecor stayed in the hospital longer than those given nitroglycerin and were slightly more likely to die. Scios executives argued that those differences were the result of chance. Analysts estimate that sales of Natrecor could reach $300 million a year. Still, Scios executives said on Friday that they were not likely to make an explicit claim that the drug is better than nitroglycerin on the label. Natrecor is a genetically engineered version of a protein secreted by a failing heart. Heart failure has become a compelling area for biotechnology companies, but there have been setbacks. A drug for acute heart failure being developed by Actelion, a Swiss company, and Genentech failed in a recent clinical trial, though it had worked in a previous trial. And Immunex, after setbacks in clinical trials, recently gave up trying to fashion its arthritis drug, Enbrel, into a treatment for the chronic form of heart failure. Scios was founded as California Biotechnology Inc. The company's stock price has quintupled in the last year on prospects for Natrecor's approval. Trading in the stock was suspended all day Friday as the advisory panel met. It closed at $24.56 on Thursday. Having been burned once, Scios executives were hesitant to declare victory until the final F.D.A. approval, which they expect by July. Still, the company is hiring a sales force, anticipating that its long dry spell will soon be over. ''Have a good weekend,'' the company's chief executive, Richard B. Brewer, told analysts in a conference call late Friday. ''I know we will.''"
"Sea Lions' Fish of Choice The population of Steller sea lions in Alaskan waters has declined sharply in the past few decades, so much so that now these mammals are listed as endangered. Their decline has coincided with the enormous growth of commercial trawling for walleye pollock, a cheap fish that is used for filet sandwiches and to make imitation crab meat. In an effort to protect the sea lions, in the past few years restrictions have been placed on pollock fishing, with an eye to making sure the sea lions have enough to eat. A noble effort, to be sure, with just one problem: Steller sea lions in the Gulf of Alaska, it turns out, would rather eat herring. That's the conclusion of a study by two researchers at the Prince William Sound Science Center, an independent research organization. Using sonar and infrared scanning equipment that enabled them to see the sea lions at night, the scientists for the first time were able to track the animals' foraging habits in winter. Writing in the journal Nature, they reported that the sea lions foraged only for Pacific herring. Although pollock were more abundant, the herring were closer to the surface, at depths of 35 to 100 feet. Dr. Richard E. Thorne, one of the researchers, said the study showed that ''given a choice between pollock and herring, the sea lions will always eat herring.'' The two fish are competitors, Dr. Thorne added, and herring are the far better fish nutritionally, so efforts to restrict pollock fishing may actually be detrimental to the sea lions. More pollock would mean fewer herring, and less good food for the animals. The Rockets' Red Glare If you set off fireworks tomorrow, you may be doing more than just risking limb and life. Researchers in India suggest that the use of fireworks can cause the localized formation of ozone, a greenhouse gas. The researchers, writing in Nature, reported that air samples taken during a fireworks-heavy festival in Delhi in November 1999 contained elevated levels of ozone. The gas is normally formed by the breakup of oxygen molecules exposed to sunlight in the presence of nitrogen oxide gases. But in this case, the researchers said, there was no correlation between the ozone levels and those of nitrogen oxides. Instead, they suggest, the ozone was formed by the light emitted by all the fireworks. Fireworks burn metal salts to create different colors, and the researchers say that much of the light emitted is of very narrow wavelengths, with enough energy to break apart oxygen molecules -- much as the ultraviolet component of sunlight does. The Role of Plants' Pores Plants, like people, need to perspire to survive. Plants' pores are called stomata, tiny openings in the leaves that allow water vapor and other gases in and out. The stomata can open and close, depending on conditions. In times of drought, for example, they can stay closed for extended periods to conserve moisture. Researchers have long suspected that calcium levels in cells surrounding the stomata play a role in the opening and closing. Now, researchers from the University of California at San Diego and two German universities have confirmed that this is true. Their study, reported in Nature, shows that it is how the levels of calcium fluctuate that determines how the stomata respond to drought. They used a mutant variety of Arabidopsis, a member of the mustard family and a common research plant. The mutant is immune to a stress hormone that plants secrete in times of drought. Without the hormone, the levels of calcium in the plant fluctuate rapidly, and the stomata stay open. When the rate of fluctuation was slowed to match that of normal plants, the stomata closed for long periods. The researchers suggest their work may lead to genetic modifications of plants to make them more drought-resistant. OBSERVATORY"
"The warm spell that kept New Yorkers in shirt sleeves (until today) and gave the United States its second-warmest November and the planet its warmest October on record was caused by -- well, climate scientists cannot quite agree. In part, many say, the recent weather is simply a matter of ''the noise'' of natural variability, more of which is on the way: after a cold snap through tomorrow, it will warm up again next week, though only temporarily. Some forecasters say the country will see a big shift, including persistent cold and storms in the East, about a week before Christmas. In any event, many weather experts say, it would be a mistake -- even with yellow jackets still buzzing in backyards in the Northeast -- to link the recent mild temperatures to the long-term phenomenon of global warming. ''The trend has definitely been for warmer years, so it's easy to be suspicious that having such temperatures is part of that trend,'' said Dr. Matthew A. Barlow, an associate research scientist at Columbia University's International Research Institute for Climate Prediction. ''But it's very difficult to separate when you're just getting a run of events versus something responding to a longer signal. Weather is often like flipping a coin. You're bound to get five heads in a row sometimes.'' In recent years, computer models fed by data from satellites, buoys and weather balloons have done fairly well at ascribing incongruities in the weather to El Niño, a Pacific warming, or La Niña, a Pacific chill. But the world is now in one of its in-between states, in which neither El Niño nor La Niña is present. The variation at this time of year becomes evident just by looking back to 2000, which saw a November-through-December stretch that was the coldest on record. Then, as now, the Niño and Niña patterns in the tropical Pacific were not in place, allowing more subtle influences on climate to take hold. The recent pattern has climatologists debating whether the influences responsible for it are coming from the Pacific or the Atlantic. Some say that the recent cool, stormy weather along the West Coast and the warm, dry spell in the East were probably shaped by a hot spot of water in the western Pacific -- near where the international date line crosses the Equator -- that comes and goes on a cycle of roughly 50 days called the Madden-Julian Oscillation. This cycle exerts a significant influence only when the bigger cycles are absent, said David Reynolds, a senior meteorologist at the federal Hydrometeorological Prediction Center in Camp Springs, Md. ''It tends to be a player in neutral years,'' Mr. Reynolds said. But its influence, he said, is much more difficult to forecast than those of other important ocean shifts. The current tropical hot spot, where sea surface temperatures are a steamy 86 degrees or so, seems to be fading, and that may explain why computer models are predicting a flip in North American conditions in about a week. Other experts, though, including Dr. Martin Visbeck, an associate professor at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, say it is just as possible that the warm fall in the East has been influenced by a closer feature, in the Atlantic: an unusually strong zone of high pressure over the Azores that has caused the jet stream to shift northward and prevented cold snaps that typically frost windshields in the Northeast by now. ''A strong high over the Azores doesn't allow cold outbreaks to come south out of Canada,'' Dr. Visbeck said. ''In November we certainly should have had a couple.'' But what causes an intense Azores high? Until the science develops further, that question is unanswerable, he said. The biggest question, as always, is what is to come. In its latest outlook for conditions through February, the National Weather Service predicts abrupt swings in temperature and precipitation, with cold waves sweeping the South and the East and a decent string of northeasters along the Atlantic Coast. In other words, a ''normal'' winter is coming. This winter could be followed by a turbulent period. There are a lot of signs that after an unusually long hiatus of three years, the Pacific is getting ready for a Niño event, in which a great tongue of warm water spreads east toward South America, raising global temperatures, disrupting fisheries, spreading droughts in Southeast Asia and battering California with heavy storms."
"The monumental task of rebuilding Afghanistan after the war has been made far more difficult, experts say, by a problem that would have existed even without the Taliban and Osama bin Laden: the drought that has gripped the country and much of southwestern Asia for three years. There is a chance that the drought -- the worst in much of the region for 50 to 100 years -- may end this winter, experts on global climate and agriculture said in interviews over the last week. But they warned that damage to fields, grazing land and water supplies would linger for years, hampering efforts to feed millions of famished refugees and restore Afghanistan's shattered economy. The damage has not been confined to Afghanistan. Throughout much of southwestern Asia, soil and seeds have blown away, vegetation has baked brown, livestock have been slaughtered and wells and rivers have run dry. Parts of northwestern Iran have had no measurable rainfall in 30 months, and more than 200,000 nomadic herders there have lost their source of income as flocks of sheep and goats have been slaughtered or died. Cities and villages have instituted water rationing. The wide reach of the drought means that Afghan refugees heading west to Iran or east to the dry side of Pakistan have found little comfort. At one camp along the Pakistan border, well drillers had to bore a mile deep before reaching the greatly sunken water table, relief workers reported. When the war ends, political tensions are bound to rise as Afghanistan rebuilds its northern provinces and begins drawing more water out of the Amu Darya, which forms part of its borders with three former Soviet republics -- Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The river is already taxed to the limit, with every drop of its annual flow of 19 cubic miles of water -- nearly four times the flow of the Colorado -- siphoned by irrigation and for water supplies before reaching the shriveled Aral Sea. ''In this region, water is more important than money,'' said Dr. Michael H. Glantz, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who has studied the Amu Darya. But the continuing lack of water and food will pose particularly daunting challenges in Afghanistan itself, where farming is the basis for more than 80 percent of the economy. Even after a generation of warfare and violence, the drought remains ''the single most important factor influencing the Afghan economy,'' Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, said in a report to the General Assembly this month. The latest assessments remain bleak, even with the chance that a change in global weather patterns -- which many scientists say is long overdue -- could bring rain and snow to Afghanistan this winter. During the wheat-planting season, which started in October and ended two weeks ago, rainfall across the northern provinces, where most wheat is grown, was extremely scant, according to a report released last week by the Foreign Agricultural Service of the Department of Agriculture. For the wheat-growing regions, the report said, cumulative precipitation from Oct. 1 to Dec. 12 was only 29 percent of the average for the period. Without rain during planting, seed rarely sprouts in the spring. The lack of rainfall in October and November came as a blow to farmers because September -- just before the planting season -- was tantalizingly wet. Even the temperature has conspired against the Afghan farmers. Runoff from melting snows and spring rains supplies most of the region's rivers and irrigation systems, but a string of unusually warm winters melted mountain snows, causing ''ill-timed runoff'' too early to be of any help, the report said. This month, the mountain weather is warmer than usual once again. The farmers' problems have been compounded by extensive damage to irrigation canals and pipelines from the continuing warfare. If the drought persists, agriculture experts say, a further consequence could be more planting of opium poppies, which tolerate dry conditions far better than wheat. By the middle of January, the United Nations, the World Bank and other international institutions hope to create a plan for rebuilding the country. But experts say the drought will prove a lasting hindrance. ''The deficit in groundwater is so severe that even with a normal or above-normal winter, you'd have to expect a two to three year recovery period,'' said Dr. Matthew A. Barlow, an author of an analysis of the drought by the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction at Columbia University. ''In some instances,'' he added, ''that would be a little on the optimistic side.'' The report (available online at http://iri.columbia.edu) says the drought may be linked to unusual conditions thousands of miles away: raised temperatures in the western Pacific and frequent rainstorms over the Indian Ocean. Indirectly, the scientists say, these changes appear to be preventing winter storms from sweeping east out of the Mediterranean. A preliminary analysis by the Columbia scientists suggests that the last severe drought in the region, from 1970 to 1972, occurred when similar ocean conditions developed. That dry spell, State Department experts say, helped topple a previous Afghan government, that of the former king, Mohammad Zahir Shah, in 1973. The ocean condition is a rare variation on La Niña, part of a regular cycle of Pacific warming and cooling episodes that can influence weather patterns around the world. In a typical La Niña year, unusually cool water covers the eastern Pacific along the Equator, contrasting with warm water to the west. For the last several years, the Pacific has been locked in La Niña conditions, but the western waters have been particularly warm. Many scientists say the Pacific is overdue for a shift back to the opposite pattern, called El Niño, in which warm water spreads east toward South America. But that has not happened yet, and La Niña could hang on for another winter. If that happens and the Columbia scientists are right, Afghanistan's plight could go on even longer. Still, they say more research will be required to confirm the relationship between La Niña and the drought. Looking ahead, climate experts said an important part of any rebuilding of Afghanistan would be prompt re-establishment of basic, regular measurements of precipitation and other weather conditions. No local weather data have been collected for several years, and without a long-term record it is difficult to spot trends that might indicate a return of drought conditions, said Dr. Barlow at Columbia. Eventually, Dr. Barlow said, researchers hope to be able to use close monitoring of telltale shifts in global patterns to predict future severe droughts in the region and help governments and relief agencies gird for battle. The same feature of the drought that made it so destructive -- its vast size -- also raises scientists' hopes that the forces that conspired to create it can be discerned. ''The good thing about its size is that it's probably more than just a chance occurrence,'' Dr. Barlow said. ''The larger scale something is, the more likely it is that we can understand and then predict it.'' A NATION CHALLENGED: CLIMATE"
"Three drought-stricken New York City reservoirs in the Catskills have fallen to historic low levels, prompting the agency that regulates water use in the Delaware River basin to declare a drought emergency today. But unlike the agency's drought declarations in 1981 and 1985, today's declaration does not impose mandatory restrictions on water use for the 17 million people who take water from the basin, including residents of New York City, Philadelphia and much of western New Jersey. Instead, the agency, the Delaware River Basin Commission, issued a milder decree intended to quicken the refilling of the three major reservoirs in the first half of 2002. It ordered that four other reservoirs in the basin share in the requirement, now faced only by the New York reservoirs, to release water to maintain mandated flows in the Delaware River. The New York reservoirs -- the Cannonsville, the Pepacton and the Neversink, known collectively as the Delaware system -- have dumped a record 110 billion gallons into the Delaware since June to maintain the flow requirement, said Michael A. Principe, director of the city's bureau of water supply. In nondrought years, he said, 30 billion to 50 billion gallons of reservoir water is used to augment the Delaware. But he said the 110 billion gallons needed in the latter half of this year has helped drop water levels in the three reservoirs to a record low. When full, the three reservoirs hold about 271 billion gallons and provide about half of the average of 1.2 billion gallons used in New York City each day. Today, the three hold only 63,804 billion gallons, or 23.6 percent of capacity. The previous low, 25.3 percent of capacity, occurred on Feb. 2, 1981, during the drought of 1980-81. But Mr. Principe said it is unlikely the city will declare an emergency in coming weeks and impose mandatory controls on water use as it did in 1981, because there is little risk now that one of the city's three reservoir systems will dry up, a criterion for a drought emergency. The city's other two systems, the Croton and the Catskills, are about 35 percent full, the commission reported today. Echoing other water officials at the commission meeting here, Mr. Principe said that if there is an optimum time for a drought it is in winter. Demand for water is far below the highs of summer, and forests absorb far less rainfall now than in June and July. Mr. Principe also said the city is far better prepared to withstand a drought now, because a 10-year campaign to install water meters and low-flow toilets has cut daily demand by about 200 million gallons since 1991. Since early November, the city has appealed to residents to conserve water. ''The real problem is if the drought continues into next summer,'' he said. ''Then we'll be in trouble.'' Mr. Principe said other factors that helped deplete the three Delaware system reservoirs were a 10-inch rainfall shortage in their watershed since summer, and the city's heavier-than-usual reliance on the three reservoirs this year because of repairs to aqueducts in the Croton system in Westchester and Putnam Counties. Because of their low levels, the three Delaware system reservoirs are supplying only about 35 percent of the city's daily water needs now instead of the usual 50 percent, Mr. Principe said. Use of the Croton system has doubled to about 20 percent of daily needs, and the Catskill system is providing 45 percent instead of the customary 40 percent, he said. In earlier conservation moves since November, the commission has cut the amount of water the city can draw from the Delaware system to 520 million gallons a day from 800 million, and relaxed its river flow requirement. The four basin reservoirs now required to help maintain the Delaware River's flow rate are two owned by electrical power companies, the Mongaup in New York State and Lake Wallenpaupack in Pennsylvania, in addition to the Nockamixon, a recreational lake owned by Pennsylvania, and the F. E. Walter Reservoir, a flood-control lake in Pennsylvania owned by the Army Corps of Engineers. Correction: December 29, 2001, Saturday An article on Dec. 19 about the effect of drought on three reservoirs that serve New York City -- the Cannonsville, the Pepacton and the Neversink, known collectively as the Delaware system -- misstated the amount of water they held then. It totaled 63.8 billion gallons, not 63,804 billion. The article also misstated the level of the city's two other systems -- the Croton and the Catskill. The Catskill was at 40.3 percent of capacity and the Croton at 84.3 percent; they were not each at 35 percent."
"A merciless and stubborn summer drought has left almost 1.5 million of the poorest farmers in Central America with no crops to sell or food to eat. From Nicaragua to Guatemala, many of the region's poorest people have been reduced to scavenging for mangoes and bananas after seeing the bean and corn fields they planted months ago reduced to a crunchy tan carpet of withered stalks and wrinkled leaves. Although the long-awaited rainy season has finally begun, there is no assurance that it will be enough to sustain the year's second planting season, which began a few weeks ago. Already crippled by debt from the failed harvest, farmers have neither the cash nor the credit to buy the fertilizers and pesticides they need to coax their crops from the overworked soil. Officials estimate that more than 700,000 people have lost at least half of their crops. It was only out of habit and hope that Celestino Salinas trudged through his small field here today poking a stick into the earth, tossing in a few seeds of sorghum and corn he had hoarded. ''We have nothing now,'' he said. ''I only think about God and ask that he favor us. We are planting with faith.'' In a region battered over the years by earthquakes, hurricanes and conflict, the drought is a potential coup de grâce. People suffer from malnutrition. Communities fret about vanishing supplies of drinkable water. And cash-short farmers, trying to stave off impatient lenders intent on repossessing their land, sell off the few scrawny cows and chickens that gave them milk and eggs. There are already reports of a desperate migration northward in search of work in neighboring countries or the elusive salvation of the United States. The governments of the region have said little. While Honduras has declared an emergency, other countries have tried to minimize the severity of the problem. The mixed and delayed responses, as well as a continued dependence on emergency food aid, point to a persistent inability of the region's leaders to prepare for disasters and to provide water, financing and social services for the many peasants who live on the edge. Aid workers and disaster experts say that instead of considering the drought an isolated emergency, officials must begin looking at long-term rural development needs. ''These people are subsistence farmers in a world that is not a subsistence world,'' said Francisco Roque Castro, the Latin America director of the United Nations World Food Program. ''They live an outdated routine. Yet people are depending on an uncertain rain for an uncertain harvest that will only maintain them in a precarious situation.'' Misery has been the only constant over the years in rural towns along the dirt roads and rocky hillsides. Even before the drought, 6,000 children in El Salvador alone died from hunger each year, the United Nations says. The loss of crops and farm laborer jobs increased the suffering. In Honduran towns around Choluteca, a region that lost 92 percent of the first harvest, many 5-year-olds are as tiny as toddlers, their wavy brown hair streaked with yellow, a sign of protein deficiency. Local officials say residents have rummaged through the castoff shrimp heads from local fish packers to make a thin soup, although even the shrimp farms have diminished output because of low water levels. Some families have one daily meal of bananas and milk. What little money adults earn is quickly spent, just as a recent food donation from the World Food Program was rapidly devoured. ''The children are desperate,'' said Ana Rosa Amador, who has four children. ''They ask me to bring them an apple or an orange, but I say no. If I buy corn and beans, I cannot buy fruit. If they are to go to school, it is a battle. My children are without food or shoes. Sure they need shoes, but they need food more.'' For months Vicente Herrera has fed his family with mangoes that he and his friends pluck from trees on the other side of a nearby hill. It is a long trek, made all the worse by having to haul sacks of the fruit in the hot sun. ''We pick them green,'' he said. ''And by the time we get home they are ripe.'' Others are taking a riskier journey, spilling over from Nicaragua and Honduras in search of scant work in El Salvador, while those Salvadorans who have the resources or connections venture to the United States. ''Our problem is we are a small country with many people and few resources,'' said Ceslo González Hernández, the comptroller in the border town of El Sauce. ''What will happen to those people who are in their most productive work years? What can they do? They will go on an adventure and end up in the deserts of Arizona. There is no life here.'' Aid groups and international donors have begun to provide food and seeds, but United Nations officials said they cannot begin to meet the need. The United States, mostly through the Agency for International Development, is providing 4,800 tons of food, a month's supply for about 365,000 people. But the shipment will not arrive for three weeks, forcing aid officials to shift reserves from current feeding programs. The farmers are also grappling with leftover debt from the first harvest and the unwillingness of banks and businesses to make loans or sell on credit. In Honduras, although the government pressed banks to forgive part of the farmers' debts, lenders have been hesitant. ''The banks are repossessing a lot of properties,'' said Ismael Banegas, the southern regional coordinator for the Honduran Agriculture Ministry. ''In some zones there are armed people who do not want to see their land taken. In one town they told the ministry that if we do not fix the situation, they will.'' But the only lasting solution, aid officials said, will have to come from an assessment of why the region has failed to cope with natural disasters. The aid officials say insufficient investment in rural areas, poor planning that allows mud-and-wattle shacks to be built on earthquake- or landslide-prone hillsides and the lack of health care and education for the poor only set up a country for the worst. ''Disasters are a symptom of a failed development paradigm,'' said Ben Wisner, a visiting researcher in environmental studies at Oberlin College and vice chairman of the hazards and risks committee of the International Geographical Union. ''The governments have no respect for the farmers' culture,'' he said, ''nor do they have any tradition of providing rural services, because they do not see the payback in human terms.'' Aid officials also said that in some countries, politics had taken precedence over human need. In El Salvador, they said, the government lagged in declaring a modified state of emergency, apparently out of fear that it would drive up interest rates on foreign loans. In Nicaragua, where campaigning is under way for the presidential election in November, the outgoing president, Arnoldo Alemán, suggested that the drought was God's punishment against his Sandinista political opponents. ''It is unfortunate that this crisis had to happen at the same time as a presidential election,'' said one aid worker in Nicaragua. ''As with foreign aid, it becomes difficult for humanitarian assistance not to become politicized.'' Some countries have begun to look at the longer term. Honduras plans to build irrigation systems in regions affected by the drought. And some have used their own resources and money from aid groups for agricultural research, seeking drought-resistant seeds and alternative crops. But too often, aid officials said, such plans are spotty and subject to political whim or the changing focus of the donor groups themselves. ''Every decade there is a lack of continuity and investment in public infrastructure, and agricultural research falls off a cliff and people start all over,'' said Kevin Sanders, the Nicaragua director of World Relief, an evangelical development group. ''There needs to be more discernment by by donor agencies in seeing what is going on with resources.'' But aid officials also fear that Central American leaders are distracted by the current emphasis on luring overseas investors to build factories. They doubt that factories will help the rural areas, since the manufacturing zones are not nearby. Nor have the aid officials seen the opening of local markets to free trade as having spurred farmers to improve their methods and their fortunes. ''These farmers are confronting tomorrow's challenges with yesterday's tools,'' said Mr. Roque of the World Food Program. ''You cannot try to survive in this modern world,'' he said, ''when you only have corn and beans to cultivate on land that is marginal and subject to drought and floods, or when you have open markets and your major competition is the United States. All it creates are generations with a built-in disadvantage.''"
"The situation here does not quite equal the horror of the 10 plagues of ancient Egypt -- the pastures have not been overrun by frogs or fleas, at least not yet. But after three years of calamities including drought, an earthquake, a killer blizzard, and even a plague of locusts that ate the grasslands clean, the sheep and cattle herders of Inner Mongolia are bewildered. They look to the coming winter with dread. ''I don't understand what's happening,'' said Jibutsima, 78, an ethnic Mongolian woman who, like hundreds of thousands of others in this part of northern China, sees her life falling apart. While a surge in herd sizes during a decade of good weather and booming demand for meat weakened the region's pastures, the immediate crisis was set off by an extraordinary sequence of natural disasters. Local officials worry that their region is an early victim of global warming, brought on by rising concentrations of carbon dioxide and other ''greenhouse'' gases. The case for a human-induced change in the weather cannot be proved, but the strange patterns here in recent years are consistent with scientific models of global warming, international experts say. If the greenhouse theory is correct, the woes of Inner Mongolian herders give a taste of broader social and environmental stresses to come. Generations of Ms. Jibutsima's family have tended livestock on these same prairies. They were nomads until the early 1980's, when they settled within the thousand acres of range land that they, like many other local families, were allocated by the government. In the 1990's, with the demand for mutton soaring and the rains good, she and her sons saved enough to buy a motorbike for herding. They even acquired a cheap truck for the three-hour drive through rutted pastures to the nearest market. Now the truck sits broken. With pastures nearly bald and no hay for the frigid months ahead, the family plans to sell off most of its animals despite abysmal prices to try to save breeding stock -- and its future. ''Can it be that nature is changing?'' said Ms. Jibutsima, who, like many Mongolians, uses a single name. ''Maybe the heavens are disturbed,'' she added, pointing to the barren hills. The troubles started in the summer of 1999, when the always-meager rains nearly disappeared and an earthquake destroyed many homes. In 2000, the rains failed again. By last fall the grasses were spotty at best and the livestock thinner than usual as winter approached. Many families went deep into debt buying hay from other regions to supplement whatever grass the animals would scrounge from dormant pastures. Then came the blizzard. For 72 hours, starting last December, in an event without known precedent here, a savage mix of snow and fine sand howled through the air, blowing so thickly that a veteran herdsman got lost and perished walking right outside his home. Many animals froze and in the weeks that followed, as the snow and dirt hardened into an impermeable barrier, many more starved to death. Hopes of relief sprouted briefly in May, when a rainstorm brought the pastures to life. But the locusts followed. Frenzied hordes of them seeming to come from nowhere ate most of the emerging grass. Little rain has fallen since then The summer was hotter than normal and more than 20 colossal dust storms have blown away much of the topsoil. For a brief time after the blizzard, the travails of Inner Mongolia attracted outside attention, and food aid from international donors has helped tens of thousands of families to avoid hunger. Still, some families, their incomes slashed, have had to pull children from school. Ethnic Mongolians account for a good share of the herders in this central pastoral region, although decades of migration into Inner Mongolia by Han Chinese, the country's dominant group, has left the Mongolians a small minority in the province over all. In the current drought, the responses of ethnic Mongolian and Han Chinese herders have tended to differ, said Zaorgetubater, the deputy chief of the county-level government in Abaga Banner. ''The Mongol attitude is that you keep some animals until you have nothing left, because if you lose your livestock you lose your way of life,'' he said. ''I think for many Han it's more just an economic calculation.'' Ms. Jibutsima, for one, is fearful. A few years ago, the family had 200 sheep and 100 cows. They are down to 100 sheep and 20 cows, and now most of them must be sold to buy hay for the remainder. Hundreds of families have already lost everything. Magjia, 50, his wife, Alatanqige, 43, and their three children are spending bored days at a temporary site around their ger, the traditional felt tent. They sold off the last of their sheep and goats, and the government fenced off their ruined pastures, one of many such areas now under protection to help the grasses return. Theirs is one of 100 displaced families that are scheduled to move into a resettlement area on the outskirts of Xilinhot, the prefecture capital. With World Bank aid, the government is building 100 brick houses with cattle pens. Mr. Magjia tried to put the best face on his family's altered state. ''We'll get by because I'm a jack of all trades,'' he said. ''I can slaughter sheep. I'm a good singer, or I could even be a tourist guide.'' Bayindeligar Journal"
"Before it became notorious as a sanctuary for terrorism, Afghanistan was already home to what may be the world's biggest humanitarian crisis. Four years of ruthless drought had forced nearly a million people to abandon their homes in search of food, while countless others have stayed behind to live off unsavory meals of animal fodder and boiled grass. One night last winter, a hasty settlement of tents was hit by a freak storm of heavy snows and sub-zero cold. In the morning, more than 150 people -- mostly children -- were found dead of exposure, leaving many to wonder what worse horrors could befall the Afghan people. Now, it seems, they will find out. With an American attack expected, hundreds of thousands of Afghans are suddenly on the move, heading for the presumed safety of ancestral villages or crossing the border into Pakistan and Iran. Their flight follows the prudent departure of virtually all foreign relief workers, the linchpins of a charitable distribution system that was expected to be feeding 5.5 million Afghans by mid-fall, about a quarter of the population. The delivery of foodstuffs within Afghanistan is now nearly at a halt. Making matters worse, the Taliban have issued a new decree threatening death to any relief worker caught using a satellite telephone, an essential means of communication. ''A major crisis had already existed, and now there's a potential crisis even bigger,'' said Andrew Wilder, in charge of field operations in Afghanistan for the American branch of Save the Children. ''The World Food Program is not sending in any food, and we're worried that time may be running out. We need to get food in there. This is the time of year we all gear up for winter, and now there is not only winter to worry about but the aftermath of an attack.'' For nearly a year, huge migrations of Afghans have made their way to refugee camps of one kind or another. These people, oddly enough, are often considered the better off. They at least could afford transportation in their escape from hunger. Left behind are those less fortunate, with no water, no seeds, no food and no savings. Relief agencies had been attempting to keep people on their land -- bringing food into remote areas through the mammoth, winding mountain passes. But on Sept. 12, the day after the attacks against America, the United Nations World Food Program, the primary source of nourishment for nearly four million Afghans, stopped transporting wheat into Afghanistan. There were two reasons, said Khaled Mansour, spokesman for the program. One, it became impossible to hire local trucks to deliver grain to outlying regions; drivers were using their vehicles for the more lucrative work of carrying the fleeing. Two, with foreign aid workers gone, there was no longer adequate oversight. ''We can't allow food to be diverted,'' Mr. Mansour said. ''We have to be assured that the people who deserve the food will get it.'' About 15,000 tons of food are stockpiled in Afghanistan, enough for about two weeks, he added. What follows is just another of that nation's coming cataclysms. ''The situation grows worse in Kabul everyday,'' said Dr. Muhammad Haider Toryali, a neurologist in Afghanistan's capital. He arrived here today with his wife and four children in Peshawar, in northwest Pakistan. The trip, by minibus, cost about $60. ''In normal times, the young, the old, so many children go to sleep at night without food. And now, what can I say? I want to ask Mr. Bush how he will rationalize attacks on hungry, innocent people. I cry for the Afghan people. I am leaving my family here in safety and then I will return to Kabul. I am a doctor and my people will need me.'' In the few days after the terrorist attacks, few Afghans even knew of America's tragedy. Television is forbidden by the ruling Taliban, and radio bulletins were sketchy. But eventually, the news began to pass freely, and the panic followed the news. ''The government of Pakistan is looking at 800,000 to one million people flooding into the Northwest Frontier Province and another 500,000 into Baluchistan,'' said Yusuf Hassan, a spokesman for the United Nations high commissioner on refugees. ''Of course, the scale depends on what happens in the coming weeks in Afghanistan, but whatever happens, there is going to be a problem with funding. These countries, Pakistan and Iran, say they cannot support any more Afghan refugees.'' Syed Iftikhar Shah, the governor of Pakistan's Northwest Frontier, this morning told reporters: ''No more refugees! I have told the United Nations. I will not allow any more.'' The Peshawar area itself has about one million Afghan refugees, a result of 22 years of war within Afghanistan as well as the current drought. Though the Pakistanis have sealed their border crossings with their neighbor, thousands of new arrivals are nevertheless snaking across the border on clandestine smuggler trails. The plan, according to the governor, is to place an additional one million refugees in dozens of fenced camps in a ''no man's land, a zero line'' between Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is something of a fiction, allowing the governor to say he has stood firm against the refugee tide. The ''no man's land'' does not actually exist. The camps will be built in Pakistan's so-called tribal areas, which by reputation are something like America's lawless Wild West -- and while technically separate from the country's four provinces, are definitely part of the nation. There, fenced in and fenced out, another horde of unfortunate Afghans will live in a limbo, waiting to be fed. A NATION CHALLENGED: REFUGEES"
"Refugees arriving here after arduous journeys from Afghanistan are describing scenes of desperation and fear at home as the threat of American-led military attacks turns their long-running misery into a potential catastrophe. Cities and towns are emptying as people defy orders from the governing Taliban and try to flee. Those with enough money are paying smugglers to take them to Pakistan. Others are marooned at closed border gates or hiding in the Afghan countryside. United Nations relief officials warned that the precarious situation in Afghanistan and deprivations from a three-year drought threatened to snowball into a major disaster. Officials estimate that 1.5 million Afghans will try to leave the country and that two million to three million more could face starvation inside. ''The worst-case scenario is when nobody can get out and aid cannot get in, because we know the crisis is already serious,'' Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency here, said in an interview. The scope of the crisis will depend on many factors, including the extent of military action against Afghanistan. But United Nations officials stressed that they were preparing for the worst as they hoped for less severe problems. Even before the threat of American retaliation, Afghanistan faced severe food shortages. From three million to four million people rely on aid from the World Food Program, and stocks are within two weeks of running out in some areas, officials said. The threat of military strikes forced the removal of international aid workers, crippling assistance programs. The Taliban have restricted communications between outside agencies and Afghan staff members still in the country, the United Nations and other organizations said. The five countries that border Afghanistan have closed their borders, fearing an influx of terrorists concealed among the refugees and new burdens on their own economies. Tens of thousands are waiting at crossing points on the borders with Pakistan and Iran, aid workers said. The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, is seeking donations of $584 million to try to limit the misery and to prepare for the expected exodus. Mr. Colville said that $30 million in aid was needed for immediate preparations and that $12 million had been pledged, with $4 million from the United States. Angelina Jolie, the actress, a good-will ambassador for the United Nations relief agency, donated $1 million. The first aircraft carrying United Nations supplies arrived in Quetta this afternoon. At about the same time, a convoy of trucks from Unicef left the Pakistani border town of Peshawar carrying 20 tons of wheat and other supplies to refugees inside an area of Afghanistan held by military forces opposed to the Taliban. Those who have managed to escape to this provincial capital in southwestern Pakistan in recent days described harrowing journeys over difficult terrain. They were in constant fear of bandits and bribe seekers. Villages along the way had little drinkable water, and meager supplies of food were often kept under armed guard. Aid workers said they had no accurate count of how many people had arrived here. Pakistani officials sent back 15,000 refugees this month. The new refugees, afraid of the same fate, vanish into the network of camps inhabited by 100,000 or more of their countrymen who have arrived in waves since the Soviet invasion in 1979. Homayoun Barak, director of a nonprofit medical service, the Guardians, which runs clinics here and in Kandahar, Afghanistan, said new refugees had health problems that included severe diarrhea, malnutrition and tuberculosis. Television is banned in Afghanistan. Word of the attacks on America and the potential reprisal was broadcast on the Voice of America and the BBC World Service. Mr. Barak said that when he left Kandahar a few days ago, stores had sold virtually every radio set to nervous residents. Rahim Ullah stayed in Afghanistan through the Soviet invasion and the civil war that followed. He said he was too frightened of the prospect of American bombs to keep his family in their town outside Kandahar. ''We don't fear the Taliban,'' Mr. Ullah said as he stood on the barren, parched ground surrounding the Tokhi-Abad refugee camp, on the outskirts of Quetta. ''We came here because war is coming.'' Mr. Ullah, 36, paid a smuggler $30 to transport his family across the border. He and his wife huddled with their five young children for three days in a wagon as a tractor pulled them laboriously through the low mountain passes and across the border at a remote point southwest of Quetta, a 150-mile trip. Their home now is a four-room mud-brick house given to them by a relative. The little food they are able to buy is cooked on a stove fueled with scraps of waste paper and garbage scrounged by the oldest children. The youngest, a 1-month-old girl named Anar Bibi, is pale and sick from hunger. The rugged terrain along the border in this remote region is laced with hundreds of hidden trails used by drug traffickers and black market smugglers. Muhammad Noor and 14 family members rode a truck along one of those routes to go to Pakistan from Kandahar. ''America will be coming to attack, and it will make things worse for us,'' Mr. Noor said as he squatted in the small house where he and his family have moved in with his brother. ''We came here because of the coming war.'' Two women who left Kandahar by taxicab were turned back at the Chaman crossing point, Mr. Colville of the United Nations said. The cab was allowed to cross, and the women found their way over the border on foot and met the driver at an arranged site. Several refugees said they had been waylaid by Taliban militia members who took away the young men in their parties at gunpoint, demanding that they stay and fight the American invaders. ''My 21-year-old son was taken,'' said Zaman Shah, who joined relatives crammed into a small mud-brick house at Tokhi-Abad after fleeing Afghanistan with the rest of his family last week. ''I could do nothing to stop them.'' A NATION CHALLENGED: REFUGEES"
"Halima Muhammad is living through the worst drought to hit eastern Africa in decades. Yet when a large pool of fresh water appeared before her the other day in the middle of the scorching earth, this thirsty woman with eight thirsty children did something remarkable: She stayed put. The water, delivered twice a week in a tanker truck to remote settlements in the northeast, is not enough for her community of 6,000 people. Elders divvy it up, requiring suffering souls like her to wait in line for their names to be called before they can approach the pool and scoop out enough to fill a 20-liter jug. It looked like a mirage, so much water in the middle of the hot sand. And soon enough, it was gone, dried up, like all the land around. A sustained period with little or no rain and a lack of government planning for it are widely blamed for this humanitarian crisis, which is affecting a vast swath from Kenya across Ethiopia and Somalia to Djibouti. Dozens of people have died in the merciless heat since December, aid workers and hospital officials say, although the full death toll remains unclear. Already, animals are dying in huge numbers, their rotting carcasses littering the landscape and devastating the local economy. Aid workers estimate that 70 percent of the 260,000 cows in the Wajir district, near the border with Somalia, have died. Even camels drop in the sand. The relatively few wells are nowhere near the tiny patches of vegetation remaining for animals to feed on. So families are faced with the awful choice of allowing their animals, which are their life savings, to either starve to death or die of thirst. Aid organizations are working to prevent the nomadic people from suffering similar fates. Oxfam, which took reporters on a tour of the region this week, is making water deliveries to two dozen remote sites, providing at least some relief. But two 20-liter containers a week is nowhere enough for a family; the usual allotment in refugee camps is 15 liters daily per person. (A liter is slightly more than a quart.) Oxfam's initial deliveries were chaotic affairs, as residents rushed toward the water with their jugs in hand, desperate to get their share. But most people now are going along with the more organized approach. ''I don't know if I'll get any,'' said Ms. Muhammad, looking frail as she stood toward the end of a long line. If no water remained when it was her turn, she said, she would ask her friends for some. They would share, she said, because next time they might be the ones who came up empty. Waiting idly for water to come is not the custom here. Women, whose job is collecting it, typically trek to faraway boreholes, where they load up their animals with plastic jugs and then head back home. But the animals are too weak for that now, the women say. The women are also too weak to make the journey, which is about 40 miles round trip, they say. ''Imagine that you are thirsty and you don't get water and you've left your children at home and they are starving,'' said Ubai Made, who jumped the line in order to get just enough water for her infant daughter, who hung like a rag doll in her arms. Muhammad Daher, an Oxfam worker reading off the names, said it was difficult to get upset at the line-jumpers. Just then, another one appeared, an old woman who was walking slowly toward the pool. ''Hey!'' he yelled, signaling for a community leader to intervene. ''Sometimes they sneak in if they are thirsty,'' he said. ''But most of them wait under the trees.'' Across the border in Somalia, the situation is equally dire. Families there are also surviving on two 20-liter jugs a week, which amounts to about three glasses of water daily per person, for drinking, cooking and washing. It is so clearly insufficient, especially given temperatures of up to 104 degrees, that some people have begun drinking their own urine to stay alive, aid workers say. ''People are not meeting their basic food and water needs,'' said Aydrus S. Daar, a Kenyan who recently took part in an Oxfam-sponsored assessment of southern Somalia. ''The situation is bad.'' Buying water from private vendors is not realistic, he said, because the price has soared from about 3 cents for a 20-liter jug in normal times to about $1, more than most people earn in a day. Desperate to relieve their thirst, those with the energy now walk the equivalent of two marathons to collect water, aid workers said, because nearby water sources are nothing more than cracked earth."
"Spring is here, and the West is dry and ready to burn. Winter is over, and the West is snowpacked and facing flood. Meteorologists say both are true. What it adds up to, when the extremes of wet and dry are averaged out, is that the long Western drought, which began in the late 1990's, is still on but without some of its past punch. ''This year the magnitude of the variability is probably greater than we've seen in as long as I can recall,'' said Mike Gillespie, a snow survey supervisor for the Natural Resources Conservation Service, a federal agency that monitors soil and water conditions. The Arkansas River is a case study in the region's bipolar condition. It drains the Colorado Rockies south and east toward Kansas and is socked with snow at its headwaters around the town of Leadville, where the snowpack is nearly 140 percent of average for mid-March. Just a few hours south on the river, however, are places that have not had significant precipitation since October and are setting records for drought. Damage from wildfires is setting a record, too. From eastern Colorado to Oklahoma and Texas, nearly 1.8 million acres have burned this year, the most for any Jan. 1-to-March 20 period in at least the 10 years since current record-keeping began and probably many years more, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, which coordinates state and federal wildfire efforts. Nor does the end seem in sight: a worse-than-usual fire season, especially in the Southwest and on the central and southern Plains, was predicted last week by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, even as areas around Lake Tahoe in California were buried by up to 14 feet of snow. In some ways, experts say, the climatic situation is less dire than in past drought years. Experience itself has helped, with states and cities across the West adopting conservation policies, new monitoring systems and information-sharing operations that allow faster responses and better planning. The variability in the drought's punch has also helped. Places like Arizona, southern Utah and New Mexico, which are now parched, got lots of precipitation last winter, meaning the reservoirs around the region are in generally better shape than they would otherwise be. A major storm on the plains of eastern Colorado and western Kansas last October put months' worth of moisture into the soil, buffering the drought's effects there as well. But scientists and government officials say the roller-coaster pattern has also underscored the fact that an uncertainty of water supply is becoming engrained in planning and Western life. ''When two out of three, or three out of four years are bad, the issue that's being driven home is how much competition there is for water in the West,'' said Michael J. Hayes, a climate impacts specialist at the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Dr. Hayes said that in the ever more urbanized West, rolling water shortages highlighted all the tensions of land use and development, in issues like wildfires, endangered species protection and the conflict between recreation and agriculture in places where a reservoir can be important for tourism and equally crucial to farmers. Those off-and-on shortages can be downright dispiriting, too. ''In the Southwest, everybody was so excited about last year,'' Dr. Hayes said, referring to the wet winter of 2004-5. ''But the cautious among them were saying it could be a blip, and now we've gone back to the dryness, so the enthusiasm is gone.'' Colorado's total snowpack -- a crucial measure of the West's hydrologic health, because those snows feed so many important rivers -- is expected to come in below average again this year, as it has for eight of the last nine, according to federal figures. The northern mountains have lots of snow, but the southern do not. The flow of the Colorado River, which supplies water to millions of people across the West, is also projected to be below average, though just slightly. The river has had only one year above average in the last seven, according to the Upper Colorado River Commission, an interstate agency that administers it. Some experts think a spate of storms that occurred in early March could nudge the river's numbers toward average, but with the snow season approaching its end, much more than that is unlikely. ''We're pretty much running out of time,'' said Tom Ryan, a hydrologist with the federal Bureau of Reclamation in Salt Lake City. Meteorologists say two factors have built and reinforced the current variability of climate: a weak La Niña pattern along the Equator in the eastern Pacific -- water temperature slightly cooler than normal -- combined with an active storm track that has brought numerous storms squarely into the northern Rockies while leaving areas to the south untouched. The confluence of forces, they say, is fairly rare and has in the past resulted in strange and sometimes violent turns of weather, including a heightened risk of what are called tornado outbreaks, in which clusters of twisters form at once. On March 12, as many as 100 tornadoes touched down in five states from Illinois to Oklahoma, killing 10 people. On April 3-4, 1974, when the atmospheric pattern was similar, as many as 148 tornadoes struck the Midwest in a single day, by all accounts the worst outbreak in American history. A weak La Niña combined with an active storm track can also draw moist warm air north from the Gulf of Mexico toward Colorado, Wyoming and New Mexico, creating a potential for other types of mayhem, including especially powerful thunderstorms along Colorado's Front Range, said John F. Henz, a meteorologist and senior project manager at HDR Engineering, a company that works on flood control projects and meteorological consulting. The conditions for that flow of air are now right for the first time in years. Mr. Henz emphasized that this did not necessarily mean the flow would occur, but he said it could. ''It appears the atmosphere is ready to rock 'n' roll,'' he said."
"Thursday began like the 141 days before it, sunny and crisp, dust settling everywhere except on the record -- set again -- for the number of days without rain. Phoenix knows all about dry weather. It is a place where children are drilled throughout elementary school to conserve water, where hotels boast of covered parking areas not to protect from rain, but to offer a bit of shade. Grown men spread lotion all over their bodies every morning. Noses bleed. Newcomers watch in horror as their hands seem to age right in front of them. But even the desert suffers droughts, and this winter has brought a strong one, the fickle air currents pushing approaching storm clouds to the east. Until this year, the record for days without recorded rainfall was set in 2000, a measly 101 days. The recording instrument for rainfall is at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, referred to as ''the bucket'' by meteorologists, and drier than a Sunday morning during Prohibition. ''People are sort of losing their grip,'' said Gary Woodard, who, as associate director of the University of Arizona Center for Sustainability of Semi-Arid Hydrology and Riparian Areas, is an expert on the region's water. '' 'Did you hear it's going to rain tomorrow?' Well, actually, there's an 80 percent chance it's not going to rain. People are getting very excited about very slim chances of rain.'' The drought has wreaked havoc on wildlife, which depend on the scant seven inches of rain that Phoenix gets in an average year, most of it in the three or four winter months. ''We have cactus dying from lack of water,'' Mr. Woodard said. ''We have well-established mesquite trees that are in a lot of trouble.'' Small animals are too dried out to do what comes naturally. ''None of the animals, none of the birds are having offspring this spring. No baby quail, no baby bunnies,'' Mr. Woodard said. An alarming result of the drought is the condition of the air. On Thursday, Arizona's Department of Environmental Quality posted its 25th pollution advisory of the winter, a remarkable number. Last winter -- the opposite of this one, with abundant rainfall -- there were no such days. There is no rain to knock the dust and particles out of the air and wash them away. ''We've just had this large, dry, stagnant air mass hanging over the area since November,'' said Steve Owens, director of the environmental agency. ''It used to be, you'd come to Arizona if you had breathing problems because of the air quality. Now, I think you'd have physicians who would say, 'Don't come to Arizona.' '' The drought seems to promise a harsh fire season. Last year, relatively heavy rains fell all winter, prompting fast growth in trees and shrubs that now sit dry and cracked. ''I don't think I could have planned a better fire season,'' said Tom Pagano, a forecaster with the federal Natural Resources Conservation Service. ''A lot of people in that business are quite worried.'' The drought has not hurt the skin-care industry. ''You have to use lotion right when you're out of the shower, when your skin is still moist,'' said Mary Low, services manager at Arizona Biltmore Resort and Spa. ''People wear sandals, so the skin on the heels of your feet get exposed to the dry air. The skin on the feet gets dry and cracked. You have to use a pumice stone and put lotion on your feet.'' Another high-end refuge, Spa du Soleil in suburban Scottsdale, uses ''medical grade oxygen'' to infuse 87 vitamins straight into a customer's face, said the spa's director, Irene Kelly. ''It really does keep your skin nice and smooth and plump and supple and hydrated,'' Ms. Kelly said. Tourists love the sunshine and high temperatures in the 60's and 70's. Local residents shrug, and click on the humidifier at night. ''You get used to it, and pray every day that it rains,'' said Justin Hoiby, 27, an event planner overseeing a Western-themed company picnic -- Pennsylvania executives racing in little covered wagons -- in Scottsdale. It was Wednesday, and to the north, a huge, fat, gray-black rain cloud hung over the mountains, like a blimp over a sold-out stadium. ''I think it's going to stay to the north,'' Mr. Hoiby said, as the executives competed in a Wild West Olympics. ''I've been watching it.'' And yet, closer it came, the cloud blocking the sun and kicking up a little dust, irritating some tourists like Mary Green, 67, visiting from Chicago. ''Nice for them,'' she said, looking over her shoulder at the grayness. ''Not nice for a visitor who wants sunshine. It's not going to last, that's the nice thing.'' But did it ever arrive? A few raindrops hit a forehead and a windshield. A nearby gas station attendant, Robert Roe, saw it: ''It came down pretty good for about two seconds.'' Jeff Grenfell, 41, a sommelier and chef, was hiking at the time. ''I got a few drops,'' he said later. Rain! Not quite. None hit the bucket at the airport, according to the National Weather Service. The dry streak did not end, and a record-setting 142nd day continued, with no precipitation in the 24-hour forecast. The record number of days in Phoenix with nothing more than trace amounts of rain (defined as less than 1/100th of an inch, but more than a drop on the forehead) is 160. Whether that record will be broken in 19 days is unclear. Forecasters are calling for a relatively high chance -- 50 percent -- of rain this weekend."
"A new species, endangered in its own way, may soon join the black rhino, zebra, buffalo and wildebeest that roam this hilly reserve: the cow. Vast herds of livestock, many of them feeble from the long journey here, are clustering around Chyulu Hills, an out-of-the-way park in southeastern Kenya several hours from Nairobi. They are also wandering into the park, prompting rangers to chase down and arrest the nomads watching over them. ''It's against the law,'' said Simon Mutuku, a ranger for the Kenya Wildlife Service at Chyulu Hills National Park. His job is the protect the park's two dozen black rhinos, some of the relatively few indigenous rhinos in Kenya to have survived rampant poaching in the 1970's. The influx of cattle into nature parks is but one sign of a fierce drought that has devastated nomadic communities, especially those in the remote and neglected north and northeast. Desperate to save their herds, nomads have driven their cows into areas normally off limits, setting off a fierce debate in Kenya, which relies heavily on its unspoiled natural areas for tourism. Drought is a regular feature in this part of the world, where the rains are fickle and the climate harsh. Just before Christmas, when Kenyans usually hold lavish holiday feasts, emaciated babies began appearing in hospitals in Wajir and Mandera, in the north. At least 40 people are reported to have died in recent weeks. Kenya's drought is part of a crisis affecting millions in the Horn of Africa. The World Food Program has appealed for resources to feed 2.5 million people in Kenya, 1.4 million in Somalia, 1.5 million in Ethiopia and 60,000 in Djibouti. ''The emergency we face in the Horn today is the result of successive seasons of failed rains,'' Holdbrook Arthur, the group's regional director for eastern and central Africa, said in a statement. ''Consequently, pastoralists living in these arid, remote lands have very few survival strategies left and require our assistance to make it through until the next rains.'' As the Kenyan government and relief agencies scramble to respond, nomads have scattered in search of pasture and water for their herds. Tens of thousands of cows are now believed to be grazing in the forests around Mount Kenya, a popular draw for visitors. Cows have also approached and in some cases entered the grasslands at Nairobi National Park, Amboseli National Park and Tsavo East National Park. As the suffering grows, pressure is building on the government to relax its ban on grazing in the parks. To drive home the point, herdsmen took about 60 cows to the Nairobi residence of President Mwai Kibaki on New Year's Day. During a drought in 2002, the former president, Daniel arap Moi, had opened the gates of the presidential compound to livestock, but Mr. Kibaki's guards rebuffed the herdsmen, who moved on to Uhuru Park, in the city center. Francis X. ole Kaparo, speaker of the National Assembly, contends that the government ought to open protected areas to cattle until the crisis passes. ''What would be the need of preserving forests and other natural resources when people are dying?'' he asked at a recent news conference. ''Of whose benefit will the resources be if people perish due to the current famine?'' But the tourism minister, Morris Dzoro, has argued against opening the parks, saying that Kenyans would suffer even more if tourism, a major source of foreign currency, were adversely affected, and that in any event, the reserves could provide only a tiny fraction of the grazing space needed by the cows. Outside the Chyulu Hills reserve, herdsmen say they are losing dozens of cows each day. When the cows become so weak they can no longer stand, they are often abandoned on the road, where they lie for days until they die. Then they are skinned, with the hides providing a little compensation. Given the difficulty of keeping them alive, cows are rapidly losing value. An animal that once fetched well over $100 is now going for a third of that, nomads say. Lemaiyan Shangwa, one of the herdsmen camped on the outskirts of the reserve, said two of his brothers had been arrested for crossing park boundaries with the family cows. The fine in each case, he said, amounted to about one cow. But the family's herd is dwindling by the day, Mr. Shangwa said. He had 250 cows a month ago, and now has only 54 still standing. ''That's all my family has in the world,'' he said. Mr. Shangwa said one elder saw so many of his cows die that he began crying openly, shocking all the other herdsmen, who are known for their stoic ways. Simon Kipaipei, who has lost about 20 of his 200 cows, said the government had to act soon because the cows were becoming too weak to walk any further. The herdsmen gathered here now huddle with their livestock near water in Makindu, where the animals guzzle water meant for the local population. Peter Njoroge, a water specialist with German Agro Action, predicts that Kenya's situation will grow still worse until more water resources are developed in remote communities. Until then, though, he sees the opening up of Chyulu Hills National Park to cattle as a sensible stopgap measure. ''Inside the game reserve there is grass,'' he said. ''The herdsmen can see the grass. But they are told that the grass can't be eaten.'' Chyulu Hills Journal"
"IT was a beautiful day in the Santa Fe National Forest. Mike and Kathy Serk, hikers from the suburbs of Santa Fe, N.M., were taking a break along the Raven's Ridge Trail, sitting on fallen logs in a pool of sunlight for a leisurely lunch of sandwiches and potato chips. Around them, towering spruce trees and pale green aspens swayed gently in a mountain breeze. Songbirds flitted among the branches. Nearby on the clear, dry trail, hikers and mountain bikers occasionally passed by. But something was out of kilter. These conditions were perfectly normal for mid-June, but this was the first week of March. The trail should have been buried beneath several feet of snow. This year snow and rain have largely passed the Southwest by. The period from November through March was the driest in Santa Fe and Albuquerque since record-keeping began in 1892. Statewide in New Mexico, this was one of the driest seasons on record. Arizona set new records for winter drought, with Phoenix recording no rainfall for a stretch of 143 days and some Tucson residents reduced to watering the cactuses in their gardens. A smattering of spring storms have done little to make up for the missing moisture. The Serks and New Mexico's other seasoned nature lovers know well what drought like this portends in a national forest, and they are getting their outdoor time while they can. ''We really love it up here, and plan on coming up a couple of times a week,'' Mr. Serk said. ''Until they shut it down.'' No one has said officially that this forest will be shut down. No one has announced, or yet decided, that its trails will be off limits this summer to backpackers and campers or its rivers closed to rafters and kayakers. But the signs are clear enough. Drought means fire danger, and when that danger is high enough, the public is barred. Forest Service officials are predicting an early start to this year's wildfire season, which could be severe. The fuel-moisture content -- a measure of the ratio of moisture to combustible material in dead trees, which indicates how prone they are to burning -- was down to between 7 and 10 percent in early March, said George Devis, a ranger at the Carson National Forest headquarters in Taos, N.M. That would be a frighteningly low reading even in the normally dry months of midsummer. ''Whenever we've had catastrophic fires,'' Mr. Devis said, ''that reading has been below 10 percent. And we're already there.'' The scant rains since then ''haven't given us enough moisture to affect the long-term situation,'' Gilbert Zepeda, supervisor of the Santa Fe National Forest, said in early April. ''Once it heats up out here, we're going to be in for a tough fire season.'' Rangers at several national forest districts in New Mexico and Arizona gave noncommittal answers when asked what kinds of restrictions were likely. ''It all depends on circumstances in the field,'' said Diane Ellenburg, a ranger in Santa Fe National Forest. But other officials were blunt. Mr. Devis had two words for anyone who wants to explore the wild lands of New Mexico this year: ''Come early.'' And John Bailey, an assistant field manager for recreation with the Bureau of Land Management, said with certainty, ''The forest will close.'' The Santa Fe and other national forests in the New Mexico mountains are popular for recreational activities from hiking in remote wilderness to camping in developed campgrounds near paved roads. If the public lands are closed, thousands of vacationers will have to find other places, putting pressure on the forests farther north, where there has been no shortage of snow and rain. The Serks are doing their best to look on the bright side. ''This will force us to go to places we've never been to before,'' Mrs. Serk said. ''We'll just take some four-day weekends and explore some backcountry areas in Colorado.'' Others are not so sanguine. J. B. Haab, an avid rock climber from Santa Fe, is unhappy about the prospect of diminished opportunities. ''Ideally I'd like to take a road trip and get out of here for the summer,'' he said. Though he and other climbers would probably try to head to more northerly natural crags when they could, he continued, ''chances are you'll find me, and a lot of others, on the walls at the indoor rock gyms.'' On the day the Serks were having their picnic, the views from the nearby trails told the story. From the steep switchbacks on the way up to Lake Peak in the Sangre de Cristo range, which reaches up to 12,409 feet, breaks in the tree branches revealed brown slopes at the Santa Fe Ski Basin, a ski area 16 miles northeast of Santa Fe. Empty chair lifts dangled over runs that had been snowless for most of the ski season. This summer, river sports seem likely to be curtailed, too. Water levels are low; the National Weather Service predicts that flows in the Rio Grande this summer will be 35 percent of normal. Mr. Bailey, who works in the Taos office that manages the popular Racecourse section of the Rio Grande, said there would be enough water for kayaking, but rafts, though usable, would be bumping along the river bottom. Commercial rafting companies may adapt by switching to fleets of inflatable kayaks. But he described the outlook for the Rio Chama, northern New Mexico's other main recreational river, as ''grim.'' Natural runoff is so low that only releases of water from the El Vado Reservoir, part of the system that supplies water to Albuquerque, may save the kayaking and rafting season. ''We're hoping to get a few releases scheduled for the period between July 4 and Labor Day,'' Mr. Bailey said, ''but nothing is certain yet.'' And regardless of water levels, if forest lands on a river's banks are closed, rafters and kayakers might be barred from favorite spots. Rangers are advising people to make sure the land they want to use is still open by calling Forest Service offices, or checking the offices' Web sites, before venturing out. But that recommendation doesn't much help people trying to plan summer vacations. ''It's frustrating,'' said Matt Jessee, a science teacher who plans to drive a van full of high school students to the Southwest for an end-of-the-year trip from Carolina Friends School in Durham, N.C. ''We can't make any promises to the kids at this point about where we're going or what we're doing. They were really looking forward to a river trip on the Chama or the Dolores, which now seems impossible.'' Eliot Salgado, a firefighter in Rio Rancho, N.M., who serves on wilderness fire crews, believes that ''just about everything is going to be shut down.'' With a sardonic smile, he predicted, ''I'm going to be one of the few people who gets to spend time in the forest this summer.'' More time, he added, than he'd like."
"It has been a trying year in Kenya, one of the worst in decades, as a severe drought killed off crops and cattle and left millions with empty stomachs and uncertain futures. In such suffering, members of Parliament have been roused to action as seldom before, finding common ground on an issue so pressing that they threatened to stonewall the budget until it was addressed: another big increase in their compensation. The move last month to reward themselves in a time of crisis infuriated Kenyan voters, most of whom eke out a living on a fraction of what their elected officials earn. It also reinforced the notion that this was a political drought, one that owed its origins as much to mismanagement in a country that should be able to feed itself as to the vagaries of nature. ''They are greedy,'' said Jackson Ndungu, 50, a computer programmer who offered one of the milder critiques one can hear on the streets of Nairobi these days. ''They are out only for themselves.'' Their reputation as fat cats did not come out of thin air. After coming into office in 2003 promising to reform an out-of-touch, authoritarian government, they squandered much of the public good will with their very first vote: it quadrupled their annual salaries. Then they really got to work, voting to give themselves low-interest car and home loans, generous health insurance and retirement packages. As for other types of legislation, the record has been mixed, with fewer than a dozen bills becoming laws each year. Kenya is a place where members of the National Assembly are expected to dole out cash to their constituents, and that is one of the justifications that legislators use to increase their own benefits. They say they frequently pay out of their pockets for funerals, school costs and other expenses associated with the people back home. They also contend that Kenyans expect their elected officials to dress well, live well and drive a car that is not a clunker. The legislative branch of government is flexing its muscles after years of being sidelined by an all-powerful head of state. ''What we are witnessing in Kenya is the rise of Parliament as a force to be reckoned with in the governance equation after 40 years of being a more or less a rubber stamp for the executive,'' said Marc Cassidy, an American-financed democracy adviser to Parliament. Still, some say legislators have lost touch with the poor districts they represent. Per capita income is about $463 a year, which nobody here would expect a lawmaker to survive on. Minimum wage is $924 a year, still far too little, in most Kenyans' view, for someone taking care of the nation's business. But the base compensation that legislators earn is about $81,000 a year, tax free, plus a variety of allowances and perks, which can effectively double their take-home pay. That means those public servants earn more than most Kenyan corporate executives and outstrip the salaries of many of their counterparts in the developed world. ''They are behaving like we are rich and as if there's no famine and poverty in the country,'' Maina Kiai, the chairman of the Kenya National Commission of Human Rights, complained recently to the newspaper The Daily Nation. ''They want to make as much money as they can.'' The latest increase, which cost the country $2.78 million, nearly doubled the mileage allowances that lawmakers receive for their Mercedeses, Land Rovers and other typically sleek rides. They will now receive a monthly lump sum of $4,719 to cover the first 350 kilometers (217 miles) they drive. After that, they will take in $1.60 per kilometer, significantly more than ordinary Kenyans can claim as deductions on their tax forms. The mileage allowance was particularly galling to Kenyans, most of whom struggle to make ends meet, because it was approved while a severe drought ravaged the country. To get the car allowances, the legislators threatened to block a vote on the government's budget plan, including a provision that provided aid to the 3.5 million people facing food shortages. Also angering Kenyans was an explanation that politicians offered for needing the additional cash: the country's shoddy road network increases the cost for them to get back and forth from their districts to the capital. Nearly unanimously, the populace has responded, ''Fix the roads.'' Within days of awarding themselves the mileage allowance, the legislators increased their constituency development funds, accounts that each can use to dole out money for projects close to home. Though popular among the public, the funds have been criticized for promoting cronyism and pork projects. The uproar came at a particularly uncomfortable time for legislators, who earlier this month were hosts for the annual meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which brought lawmakers from throughout the world to Nairobi to discuss the issues of the day. But the Kenyan lawmakers offered a solution to their woes. They pleaded with the local news media to keep quiet about their salaries while their visitors, many of whom are more poorly paid than the Kenyans, were in town. ''We should keep our dirty linen in the wardrobe for the duration of the meeting as they do elsewhere in the world,'' said Andrew Ligale, the head of Kenya's organizing committee for the conference. But the news media did not take the suggestion. Front pages devoted considerable attention to the dispute. ''We have a very strong, selfish and indulgent Parliament that is only united when milking the Exchequer,'' The Standard said in an editorial at the start of the conference. By the conference's end, another front page article surveyed the salaries of many of the attendees at the conference and found Kenyan members of Parliament to be among the most highly paid in the world. The speaker of the National Assembly, Francis Ole Kaparo, warned his colleagues publicly the other day that if they continued focusing more attention on themselves than on the nation's business they would surely be voted out. ''People aren't fools,'' the speaker said. ''People follow what they do, and if they don't stay in line with their constituents they will not be re-elected.'' But apparently many of these lawmakers already believe they are short-timers, which is why they are feathering their nests as much as they can, while they can. Still, some good may come out of this. There is talk of creating an outside commission to decide parliamentary salaries, taking the issue out of the hands of the beneficiaries. Until that time, though, lawmakers are watching their backs. One threatened to vote for the ouster of President Mwai Kibaki if he tried to eliminate the constituent development funds, which give lawmakers the ability to decide spending priorities themselves. Another has proposed censuring the speaker for daring to criticize the members' pay, not to mention their penchant for extended recesses. ''He should not play inaccurate populist politics just for the expediency of the moment,'' said Otino Kajwang, who contends he and other legislators work hard for the good of the country and deserve every shilling they get.

"IT has been a warm, dry spring in Colorado. As of June 6, the yellows and oranges that indicate abnormally dry to severe drought on the United States Drought Monitor map cover the entire state, and one bright red blossom of extreme drought was expanding out on the eastern plains. Denver has received only 1.73 inches of precipitation in the last three months. Nolan Duskin, from the Colorado Climate Center, knows that several major drought years can be part of a larger period of drought and he is discouraged by what he calls the rapid deterioration toward 2002 conditions. In 2002, the one-two-three punch of low snowfall, a warm windy spring and a hot dry summer led to one of the worst fire seasons in Colorado history, a serious decline in every sector of the $8.5 billion tourist industry and the disruption of tens of thousands of lives. The residents of my county watched in horror as two huge forest fires converged upon us, turning our skies black, the moon orange and our pastures to dust. In a drought year, however, no one in the state is hit faster and harder than the farmers and ranchers out on the eastern plains. In a system with almost no irrigation potential built in, the equation is simple: if the rain doesn't come, the grass doesn't grow, and if the grass doesn't grow, there is no way to feed the cattle. Mark Frasier, who runs 3,400 head of beef cattle yearlings and 400 head of fall-calving cows on a ranch near Woodrow, is trying hard to stay optimistic. His commitment to the land is evident in the soft-spoken timbre of his voice, his grief for the spring rain that never came, his hope for summer thunderstorms and his faith that the pasture will be forgiving. Mr. Frasier employs holistic ranching techniques on his 29,000 acres of native range. The rolling hills of blue gamma and buffalo grass are maintained by rotating the stock almost constantly among 190 paddocks of grazing. That way, he says, ''the cattle recycle nutrients and organic matter back into the soil, which helps the ground retain moisture. The soil surface benefits from the disturbance caused by the hooves of the animals, even when the ground is dry. We can't say when we are going to get rain, but we can prepare ourselves so that our soil is receptive and the plants are healthy enough to respond when we do.'' For the wheat farmers, though, who are completely dependent on early spring moisture, it is already too late. This year's winter wheat crop, which will be harvested in July, could amount to only 50 million bushels, half of the yearly average. And another year of losses is something that Colorado farmers, who lost more than $100 million in crop revenue in 2002, can't afford. Brad Udall, director of the Western Water Assessment at Colorado University at Boulder, is one of a growing number of scientists who fear that the news may be even worse than another major drought year in a longer drought period, and that the dry, cracked range land of the American Southwest is destined to become the next icon of global warming. A growing number of researchers agree that based on current emissions, there is an additional one degree Fahrenheit warming commitment embedded into our 100-year plan. In other words, all the carbon dioxide molecules we emit today are going to stay wrapped around the earth for 100 years and continue to warm it. Even if people found a way to radically reduce emissions, Mr. Udall says, it would be a long time ''before we could make the thermometer stop going up.'' And that is bad news for Mr. Frasier and his neighbors, who know that once a couple of fires get started in the mountains, which Mr. Duskin says could happen any minute, all of the attention will turn away from agriculture to the resort towns and the suburbs, leaving the ranchers to weather the drought of 2006 alone.

"Covered as it is by red bark and dotted with ornamental grasses and purple sage shrubs, the front yard of Salt Lake City's mayor stands out in contrast against the other, uniformly green lawns on the tree-lined street. Not only is Mayor Rocky Anderson's yard distinctive, though. It is also illegal, one of hundreds of drought-friendly yards and gardens here that are in violation of zoning ordinances. In light of a five-year drought that meteorologists say ended last year, Mr. Anderson is one of a growing number of homeowners in desert cities across the West who have traded in their manicured lawns and colorful flower beds for ground cover and gardens that require little water. In Salt Lake City, though, all front yards must be completely covered with flat green grass, which needs to be watered often to keep it from turning brown and strawlike. Although the zoning ordinance is rarely enforced, some Salt Lake City leaders -- including the mayor -- want to bring the letter of law in line with current landscaping trends. ''I think the zoning ordinance is ridiculous,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''It clearly needs to be changed.'' The mayor is working with environmentalists to come up with an amendment to the ordinance. The final language has not been settled on, but so far, the mayor and other city officials said, it would require vegetation on only one third of a front lawn, and that third could be covered with any plant including drought-resistant ones. The rest of the lawn could be covered with mulch or gravel. Once the wording is complete, the amendment will go before the City Council. ''Five or six years ago, nobody had these types of lawns here,'' Mr. Anderson, 54, said. ''In my parents' garden, they always had petunias and lush bright flowers that required a lot of water. But I think having the native plants is reflective of the identity of our place. We're in a desert and maintaining our identity can be extremely beautiful, too.'' In some Southwest cities, low-water landscapes, known as xeriscapes, have become the norm, and zoning ordinances have been changed accordingly. Many people in Albuquerque have rock gardens with drought-tolerant plants, which are encouraged by an ordinance that allows residents to plant grass on only 20 percent of their lawn. In Phoenix, the law does not require any decoration in front of single-family homes -- only that front yards look neat and be free of dead plants or tumbleweed. There, cactuses are the decoration of choice. Within the next 10 years, xeriscapes will be standard in Salt Lake City, too, Mr. Anderson said, if only because they are so much more affordable. He said that after he planted his, his water bill dropped 65 percent. Nurseries and plant stores here report that demand for drought-tolerant plants has increased in the last five years. Shane Taylor, 26, manager of the nursery Cactus and Tropicals, said that to make room for the low-water plants, the store had to reduce its supply of ferns and other water guzzlers. Mr. Taylor said drought-tolerant plants came in all colors, including red and orange blanket flowers, yellow columbine, green smooth sumac and lavender vinca. But not everybody is a fan of the new style of landscaping. Richard Nigro, 53, a Salt Lake City stockbroker who has a lush garden of green grass and plants, said he liked the drought-tolerant gardens only if they were well maintained. ''A lot of these xeriscapes look horrible, and people just use it as an excuse not to do anything with their yards,'' Mr. Nigro said. ''A lot of people just let weeds grow instead of native plants.'' After Mr. Anderson created his new yard, a complaint was filed with the Salt Lake City forester because the trees in front of his house looked as if they were dying. And they probably were, the mayor said, until he learned to care for them properly. Mr. Nigro said he was particularly pleased with Mr. Anderson's new garden. ''Before he was mayor, his lawn looked terrible,'' Mr. Nigro said. ''There was grass, but it was poorly kept.'' Mr. Anderson has learned that his new yard takes a lot of work if it is to remain healthy and attractive. ''I had some folks digging up weeds for me and they dug up some of my drought-tolerant plants,'' he said, laughing. ''I guess the garden needed to be thinned out if they could not tell the difference.''"
"With parts of South Dakota at its epicenter, a severe drought has slowly sizzled a large swath of the Plains States, leaving farmers and ranchers with conditions that they compare to those of the Dust Bowl of the 1930's. The drought has led to rare and desperate measures. Shrunken sunflower plants, normally valuable for seeds and oil, are being used as a makeshift feed for livestock. Despite soaring fuel costs, some cattle owners are hauling herds hundreds of miles to healthier feedlots. And many ranchers are pouring water into ''dugouts'' -- natural watering holes -- because so many of them (up to 90 percent in South Dakota, by one reliable estimate) have gone dry. Gov. Michael Rounds of South Dakota, who has requested that 51 of the state's 66 counties be designated a federal agricultural disaster area, recently sought unusual help from his constituents: he issued a proclamation declaring a week to pray for rain. ''It's a grim situation,'' said Herman Schumacher, the owner of a livestock market in Herreid, S.D., a small town near the North Dakota line where 37,000 head of cattle were sold from May through July, compared with 7,000 in the corresponding three months last year. ''There's absolutely no grass in the pastures, and the water holes are all dried up. So a lot of people have no choice but to sell off their herds and get out of the business.'' Drought experts say parts of the states most severely affected -- Nebraska, the Dakotas, Montana and Wyoming -- have been left in far worse shape because of recent history: several years of dry conditions, a winter with little snow and then, with moisture reserves in the soil long gone, a wave of record heat this summer. By late August, rain had fallen several times in some areas, but Bob Hall, an extension crops specialist at South Dakota State University, said it amounted to ''a drip in a bucket.'' ''The bottom line is that even if we got relief starting today, at this minute,'' Dr. Hall said, ''it would take a few years economically to recover.'' As if earless, shriveled cornstalks were not enough, farmers and ranchers say they carry a sense that their counterparts elsewhere seem to be doing just fine, leaving them with what feels like an invisible disaster, unnoticed by the outside world. Some farmers in Midwestern states like Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, as well as some in the eastern sections of South Dakota and Nebraska, tell of a respectable growing season. Even here in Mitchell, about 70 miles west of Sioux Falls, some residents did not grasp the scope of the drought until the Corn Palace, this city's tourist-luring castlelike civic center wrapped in hundreds of thousands of ears of corn, announced that because there was not enough of the crop, it would not redecorate this year for the 2007 season. ''We don't have any record of anything like this happening before,'' said Mark Schilling, the director of the Corn Palace, a campy, 114-year-old landmark promoted on highway billboards with endless corn puns. ''But if there's not a crop, there's not a crop,'' Mr. Schilling said quietly. After weeks and weeks with little rain and high temperatures, one farmer, Terry Goehring, watched the mercury spike to 118 degrees in his Mound City, S.D., field one day in July. That was it. Mr. Goehring, who has farmed since 1978, sold half his 250 head of Angus cattle. ''There was no corn,'' he said. ''There was no hay. We had nothing. And in that moment, I knew there was no choice.'' Climatologists with the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln said scientists deemed the weather conditions and its effects in the areas of the worst drought a once-in-50-years experience. In some cases, it has been worse than that. On July 15, a weather station in Perkins County, S.D., near North Dakota, recorded a temperature of 120 degrees. That matched the highest ever reported in the state since the start of such record-keeping in July 1936, said Brian Fuchs, a climatologist at the Nebraska center. Given such conditions, it is hardly a surprise that crop estimates are so gloomy. Steve Noyes, deputy director at the South Dakota field office of the government's National Agricultural Statistics Service, said the winter wheat crop here had shrunk by 43 percent from last year's; alfalfa hay is expected to be down by 35 percent; and 22 percent of pasture land is deemed ''very short,'' with 35 percent ''short,'' figures significantly worse than those of a year ago. For the most part, commodity prices have not been affected, said Greg Lardy, a beef cattle specialist at North Dakota State University. While the region affected is hard hit, Dr. Lardy said, it has not been large enough to leave a mark on prices, particularly since some other regions have experienced strong seasons. A walk through the fields of David Gillen, whose family has farmed in White Lake, 35 miles west of Mitchell, since 1897, is a tour of a drought. While some fields have survived, others are not worth harvesting. There, corn that should have been lanky by now is short and yellow, and many stalks carry no ears: the pollination, which should have occurred at the end July, never happened at all, given the extreme heat. ''This is my favorite time to be out here looking at the fields,'' Mr. Gillen said. ''But there's nothing to see.'' While the soybean fields may improve with the recent rains, it is too late for this year's corn, a circumstance that surely would have made the creators of the Corn Palace cringe. In 1892, the Corn Belt Real Estate Association decided it made sense to nail ears of corn to the side of the palace as a salute to the bounty that the region's soil could produce, and as a retort to those (including Lewis and Clark) who seemed to doubt that these seemingly wild lands could be farmed. So for years (and through three different palaces in Mitchell), annual themes (like the ''Space Age'' in 1969 and a ''Salute to Rodeo'' this year) have been captured in images made all of corn here, at a cost, in today's prices, of about $140,000 a year. But as this summer proceeded and the sun blazed on, the palace board nervously monitored the fields whose dramatically colored corn goes to the palace, waited for rain and consulted with an agronomist. With fields of certain colors struggling, the board decided the murals it had planned for the 2007 theme, ''Everyday Heroes,'' could not be created, said Mr. Schilling, the palace's director. Wade Strand, the farmer who grows all of the palace's colored corn, took the news ''pretty hard,'' Mr. Schilling said. Looking back, Mr. Strand said he had believed that he had grown enough corn. He said he had hoped the designs could be made without orange tone and shades of black and light red. ''But they felt that the colors I was missing were strategic to the theme,'' Mr. Strand said. Mr. Schilling said he believed that the current murals would remain intact through a second year, though he acknowledged that they might fade a bit. The vulnerabilities now, he said, are the risks inherent in art, or anything, made of corn: the effects of birds and wind, sun and heat."
"Bhanwar Lal Yadav, once a cultivator of cucumber and wheat, has all but given up growing food. No more suffering through drought and the scourge of antelope that would destroy what little would survive on his fields. Today he has reinvented himself as a vendor of what counts here as the most precious of commodities: the water under his land. Each year he bores ever deeper. His well now reaches 130 feet down. Four times a day he starts up his electric pumps. The water that gurgles up, he sells to the local government -- 13,000 gallons a day. What is left, he sells to thirsty neighbors. He reaps handsomely, and he plans to continue for as long as it lasts. ''However long it runs, it runs,'' he said. ''We know we will all be ultimately doomed.'' Mr. Yadav's words could well prove prophetic for his country. Efforts like his -- multiplied by some 19 million wells nationwide -- have helped India deplete its groundwater at an alarming pace over the last few decades. The country is running through its groundwater so fast that scarcity could threaten whole regions like this one, drive people off the land and ultimately stunt the country's ability to farm and feed its people. With the population soaring past one billion and with a driving need to boost agricultural production, Indians are tapping their groundwater faster than nature can replenish it, so fast that they are hitting deposits formed at the time of the dinosaurs. ''What we will do?'' wondered Pavan Agarwal, an assistant engineer with the state Public Health and Engineering Department, as he walked across a stretch of dusty fields near Mr. Yadav's water farm. ''We have to deliver water.'' He swept his arms across the field, dotted with government wells. This one, dug 10 years ago, had already gone dry. In that one, the water had sunk down to 130 feet. If it were not for the fact that electricity comes only five hours a day, every farmer in the area, Mr. Agarwal ventured, would be pumping round the clock. Saving for a Dry Day If groundwater can be thought of as a nation's savings account for dry, desperate drought years, then India, which has more than its share of them, is rapidly exhausting its reserve. That situation is true in a growing number of states. Indian surveyors have divided the country into 5,723 geographic blocks. More than 1,000 are considered either overexploited, meaning more water is drawn on average than is replenished by rain, or critical, meaning they are dangerously close to it. Twenty years ago, according to the Central Groundwater Board, only 250 blocks fell into those categories. ''We have come to the worst already,'' was the verdict of A. Sekhar, who until recently was an adviser on water to the Planning Commission of India. At this rate, he projected, the number of areas at risk is most likely to double in the next dozen years. Across India, where most people still live off the land, the chief source of irrigation is groundwater, at least for those who can afford to pump it. Here in Jaipur District, a normally parched area west of New Delhi known for its regal palaces, farmers depend on groundwater almost exclusively. Across Rajasthan State, where Jaipur is situated, up to 80 percent of the groundwater blocks are in danger of running out. But even fertile, rain-drenched pockets of the country are not immune. Consider, for instance, that in Punjab, India's northern breadbasket state, 79 percent of groundwater blocks are classified as overexploited or critical; in neighboring Haryana, 59 percent; and in southern tropical Tamil Nadu, 46 percent. The crisis has been exacerbated by good intentions gone awry and poor planning by state governments, which are responsible for regulating water. Indian law has virtually no restrictions on who can pump groundwater, how much and for what purpose. Anyone, it seems, can -- and does -- extract water as long as it is under his or her patch of land. That could apply to homeowner, farmer or industry. Electric pumps have accelerated the problem, enabling farmers and others to squeeze out far more groundwater than they had been able to draw by hand for hundreds of years. The spread of free or vastly discounted electricity has not helped, either. A favorite boon of politicians courting the rural vote, the low rates have encouraged farmers, especially those with large landholdings, to pump out groundwater with abandon. ''We forgot that water is a costly item,'' lamented K. P. Singh, regional director of the Central Groundwater Board, in his office in the city of Jaipur. ''Our feeling about proper, judicious use of water vanished.'' The Politics of Water With the proliferation of electric pumps, he added, it took only 20 years for Rajasthan's groundwater reserves to sink to their current levels. Twenty more years of the same policy could be catastrophic. The central government has been coaxing states to require the harvesting of rainwater, for instance by installing tanks or digging ponds, so the water will seep into the earth and recharge the aquifers. Other solutions are politically trickier. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has warned of the consequences of free or cheap electricity and urged state officials to crack down on pumping. But state officials, attuned to potential backlash, have been slow to respond. Tighter restrictions would in any case run up against one of the government's top priorities, one that India has long considered vital for its independence: the goal of growing its own food. The fear now, among those who study Indian agriculture, is that without a careful review of water policy and a switch to crops that use less water, India stands to imperil its food production. Here in the dust bowl of Rajasthan, desperate water times have already called for desperate water measures. On a parched, hot morning not far from Mr. Yadav's home, a train pulled into the railway station at a village called Peeplee Ka Bas. Here, the wells have run dry and the water table fallen so low that it is too salty even to irrigate the fields. The train came bearing precious cargo: 15 tankers loaded with nearly 120,000 gallons of clean, sweet drinking water. The water regularly travels more than 150 miles, taking nearly two days, by pipeline and then by rail, so that the residents of a small neighboring town can fill their buckets with water for 15 minutes every 48 hours. It is a logistically complicated, absurdly expensive proposition. Bringing the water here costs the state about a penny a gallon; the state charges the consumer a monthly flat rate of 58 cents for about 5,300 gallons, absorbing the loss. A Parched Village The growing water shortage has transformed life in Peeplee Ka Bas. Its men left long ago to seek work elsewhere. The women remain to spend the blistering summer mornings digging ponds in the barren earth, hoping to catch monsoon rains. Where farming once provided a livelihood, now digging puts food on the table. For a day's labor, under this public works program intended to help the poorest families, each woman is paid the equivalent of 40 cents, along with 24 pounds of wheat. It was not always this way. Once farming made sense. Many of the women digging on a recent morning remembered growing their own food -- peas, tomatoes, chili peppers, watermelons -- and selling it, too, at the nearest town market. Year by year, the wells began to run dry. And there were several years of little to no rain. Meera, a mother of three who uses only one name, who is lucky enough to come from a landowning family, still watched her husband leave the village to find work in a cement factory. There were times, she acknowledged, when it became difficult to feed the children. Now she finds herself digging ponds for a bag of wheat. And praying for rain. ''Our life is not life,'' Meera said. ''Only when it rains, there's life.'' A half-hour's drive along a narrow country road, just next door to Mr. Yadav's water farm, live a pair of brothers, Nandalal and Jeevanlal Chowdhury. They have so far resisted following Mr. Yadav's lead in selling what water is left under their land, mainly because it requires a hefty investment to buy pumps. This year, the water in their well dropped to 130 feet, twice as deep as 10 years ago. Only millet grows here now, a crop that takes relatively little water, and cattle fodder. Their last vegetable harvest was five years ago. They know they will not go on farming forever. The water will not last. They will search for other work, elsewhere. Jeevanlal Chowdhury was vague on what prospects the land would hold for his children. ''We are close to the finishing point,'' he said. His daughter, a sixth grader, listened intently to the conversation. ''The water is almost gone.'' Articles in this series examine India's growing water crisis.

"The aspen, an emblematic tree of the West and the most widely distributed tree in North America, is rapidly and mysteriously dying. Its rapid decline is bewildering scientists and forest ecologists, who say they cannot pinpoint a cause. ''What's causing the aspen to die?'' asked Wayne Shepperd, a veteran researcher at the Rocky Mountain Research Center of the United States Forest Service. ''We don't know. Maybe this has been there all along, and we haven't noticed it before, or maybe it's something new.'' There is no shortage of suspects. Forest experts, who met this month at a conference in Utah to discuss the problem and look for solutions, say it may be insects, drought or climatic stress in general or overgrazing by animals like elk and cattle. Or it may be none or all of the above. The aspen dieback is particularly baffling in that it seems to be occurring just in some Western states and is not affecting any neighboring trees, many of which already suffer from a plague of mountain pine beetles that has been devastating the West. Since word of the aspen dieback began spreading last fall, Dr. Shepperd's office began receiving reports of similar losses throughout the West -- not just Colorado, where the problem is most predominant, but also in Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Montana, Arizona and southern Wyoming. But because there has been no concerted investigation, it is not clear how many aspen have died, much less why. ''Quite honestly we just don't have any answers,'' Dr. Shepperd said. The die-off is particularly worrisome because of the special nature of the aspen. The tree reproduces through vegetative regeneration. Genetically identical suckers sprout from the root of one tree and become clones. If the root of an aspen dies, it is unlikely to reproduce. ''We actually dug in a couple of instances and looked for live roots, and we couldn't find any,'' Dr. Shepperd said. The dieback may go back as far as 1996, at the beginning of the recurrent drought, according to Mary Lou Fairweather, a plant pathologist for the Southwestern region of the Forest Service, who said she first noted the loss of trees in Arizona. ''I started monitoring the dieback on how the trees were growing, when and if it was continuing,'' Ms. Fairweather said. She added that she thought that the first deaths were caused by seasonal climate changes like spring freezes and then accelerated by other factors, including stress affecting the trees, although she noted that those were just theories. In Utah, Dale Bartos, an aspen ecologist for the Forest Service, agreed that the lack of precipitation had contributed more stress to the aspen than initially thought. ''We've been in a major drought over the last few years, and I'm sure this has exacerbated the problem,'' Mr. Bartos said. Dr. Shepperd is not so sure. Although the current drought is probably a factor, he said, extensive long-term studies are needed. ''There's no real pattern,'' he said. But he has noticed one intriguing clue. Some younger groves of aspen appear to be more resilient than the mature ones. ''Generally, younger stands seem to be healthier,'' he said. But he added that it would be discouraging if these younger stands did not sprout. ''We're seeing it across the spectrum of site-conditioned aspen,'' he said, meaning that no aspen is safe. Mr. Bartos estimates that at the current rate 10 percent of the aspens in the West could die within several years. Some of his colleagues call that a conservative estimate. ''We've seen in southern Utah, over a period of 12 years, where we have very healthy-looking clones with dark green leaves go to sites where there aren't any trees left at all,'' Mr. Bartos said, adding that in other cases researchers had observed an even quicker rate of decline. ''To me, 12 years is fairly rapid when we're talking about trees that have been on site for 100 to 125 years.'' Nevertheless, the scientists who met in Utah to look for a solution came away somewhat hopeful, said John Guyon, a forest pathologist for the Intermountain Regional Office of the Forest Service. Mr. Guyon said he thought that grazing elk and cattle might be eating away the regenerating aspen. And because the trees thrive after disruptions like avalanches and fires, the lack of such disturbances may be contributing to the dieback. Jim Worrall, another Forest Service pathologist, said the question was fraught with uncertainty. ''What we don't know is what the future holds,'' Mr. Worrall said. ''It's an unprecedented event.''"
"The Colorado River Basin is more prone to drought than had been thought, a panel of experts reported yesterday, and as the climate warms and the population in the region grows, pressure on water supplies will become greater. The severe droughts the region suffered in the 1990s and early 2000s would not stand out in the record of the last few centuries, the panel said, and the future presents ''a sobering prospect for elected officials and water managers.'' The panel said residents of the region should prepare for more frequent and more severe dry spells, and ''costly, controversial and unavoidable trade-offs'' in water use. The data discussed in the report have been published before in scholarly journals and elsewhere. But Ernest T. Smerdon, a former dean of the College of Engineering and Mines at the University of Arizona, who led the panel, said its members hoped with this publication to pull the findings into a single document that ordinary people could understand. Severe droughts will recur, Dr. Smerdon said, ''and we better be prepared. That is the message.'' He spoke at a news conference yesterday in Las Vegas, where the report was made public. The panel recommended an ''action-oriented'' study of water use patterns and demands, including drought planning, population projections and possible effects of transferring water to urban areas from agriculture, still the dominant consumer. Dialogue between policy makers and scientists who study water issues should be ''a permanent fixture within the basin,'' it said. The panel, organized by the National Research Council, the research arm of the National Academy of Science, noted that the water allocation agreement for the basin, the Colorado River Compact, was negotiated in 1922 based on river flow records dating to the 1890s, when gauging stations were established. The agreement assumed that the annual river flow was 16.4 million acre feet -- enough to cover 16.4 million acres to a depth of one foot. But for some time, the panel said, researchers have known that the early 20th century was unusually wet and that 15 million acre feet was a more accurate estimate of the flow. Recent studies based on tree rings put the figure lower still -- as low as 13 million acre feet -- and suggest that ''drought episodes are a recurrent and integral feature of the region's climate.'' Because trees grow more when it is wet, scientists use tree ring size as an indicator of water abundance. The report says the federal Bureau of Reclamation and other agencies requested the panel's review in the wake of the new findings. Global warming is already making things worse, the experts said. For one thing, warmer weather means less precipitation in the form of snow, which is stored in the region's mountain snowpack. And the snowpack itself forms later and melts sooner each winter. As a result, the steady reliability of snowpack water storage is compromised. Also, warmer weather itself increases consumer, environmental and agricultural demands for water. Rainfall patterns are difficult to predict, another panel member, Connie A. Woodhouse, a geographer at the University of Arizona, said at the news conference. But the report said it was probable that the region would experience less precipitation over all in a warmer world. Cloud-seeding, water desalinization and improved underground water storage have yet to emerge as solutions, the report said, and even conservation, while helpful, ''is no panacea,'' Dr. Smerdon said. The report, which is available at www.nationalacademies.org, notes that the basin, 240,000 square miles in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, California and Mexico, has seen rapid population growth in recent decades. Until about 30 years ago, the panel wrote, growing demands for water were met through building dams and reservoirs. But today, the report says, ''prospects for constructing additional large dams in the Colorado River basin have diminished.'' Instead, ''there is going to have to be some kind of reallocation of who gets the water,'' said Richard Seager, a climate expert at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory, who was not involved in the panel's report. Dr. Seager, who studies the drought history of North America, said that it was ''silly'' to put golf courses in the region's desert areas and that hotels and other businesses were already installing water-conserving toilets and other fixtures. But he added, referring to cattle and cotton raising, ''Let's think whether it makes sense to have all this subsidized agriculture in the region, people who aren't even paying the full cost of the water they do use.''"
"In this dust-choked region, long seen as an increasingly barren wasteland decaying into desert, millions of trees are flourishing, thanks in part to poor farmers whose simple methods cost little or nothing at all. Better conservation and improved rainfall have led to at least 7.4 million newly tree-covered acres in Niger, researchers have found, achieved largely without relying on the large-scale planting of trees or other expensive methods often advocated by African politicians and aid groups for halting desertification, the process by which soil loses its fertility. Recent studies of vegetation patterns, based on detailed satellite images and on-the-ground inventories of trees, have found that Niger, a place of persistent hunger and deprivation, has recently added millions of new trees and is now far greener than it was 30 years ago. These gains, moreover, have come at a time when the population of Niger has exploded, confounding the conventional wisdom that population growth leads to the loss of trees and accelerates land degradation, scientists studying Niger say. The vegetation is densest, researchers have found, in some of the most densely populated regions of the country. ''The general picture of the Sahel is much less bleak than we tend to assume,'' said Chris P. Reij, a soil conservationist who has been working in the region for more than 30 years and helped lead a study published last summer on Niger's vegetation patterns. ''Niger was for us an enormous surprise.'' About 20 years ago, farmers like Ibrahim Danjimo realized something terrible was happening to their fields. ''We look around, all the trees were far from the village,'' said Mr. Danjimo, a farmer in his 40s who has been working the rocky, sandy soil of this tiny village since he was a child. ''Suddenly, the trees were all gone.'' Fierce winds were carrying off the topsoil of their once-productive land. Sand dunes threatened to swallow huts. Wells ran dry. Across the Sahel, a semiarid belt that spans Africa just below the Sahara and is home to some of the poorest people on earth, a cataclysm was unfolding. Severe drought in the 1970s and '80s, coupled with a population explosion and destructive farming and livestock practices, was denuding vast swaths of land. The desert seemed determined to swallow everything. So Mr. Danjimo and other farmers in Guidan Bakoye took a small but radical step. No longer would they clear the saplings from their fields before planting, as they had for generations. Instead they would protect and nurture them, carefully plowing around them when sowing millet, sorghum, peanuts and beans. Today, the success in growing new trees suggests that the harm to much of the Sahel may not have been permanent, but a temporary loss of fertility. The evidence, scientists say, demonstrates how relatively small changes in human behavior can transform the regional ecology, restoring its biodiversity and productivity. In Niger's case, farmers began protecting trees just as rainfall levels began to rise again after the droughts in the 1970s and '80s. Another change was the way trees were regarded by law. From colonial times, all trees in Niger had been regarded as the property of the state, which gave farmers little incentive to protect them. Trees were chopped for firewood or construction without regard to the environmental costs. Government foresters were supposed to make sure the trees were properly managed, but there were not enough of them to police a country nearly twice the size of Texas. But over time, farmers began to regard the trees in their fields as their property, and in recent years the government has recognized the benefits of that outlook by allowing individuals to own trees. Farmers make money from the trees by selling branches, pods, fruit and bark. Because those sales are more lucrative over time than simply chopping down the tree for firewood, the farmers preserve them. The greening began in the mid-1980s, Dr. Reij said, ''and every time we went back to Niger, the scale increased.'' ''The density is so spectacular,'' he said. Mahamane Larwanou, a forestry expert at the University of Niamey in Niger's capital, said the regrowth of trees had transformed rural life in Niger. ''The benefits are so many it is really astonishing,'' Dr. Larwanou said. ''The farmers can sell the branches for money. They can feed the pods as fodder to their animals. They can sell or eat the leaves. They can sell and eat the fruits. Trees are so valuable to farmers, so they protect them.'' They also have extraordinary ecological benefits. Their roots fix the soil in place, preventing it from being carried off with the fierce Sahelian winds and preserving arable land. The roots also help hold water in the ground, rather than letting it run off across rocky, barren fields into gullies where it floods villages and destroys crops. One tree in particular, the Faidherbia albida, known locally as the gao tree, is particularly essential. It is a nitrogen-fixing tree, which helps fertilize the soil. Its leaves fall off during the rainy season, which means it does not compete with crops for water, sun or nutrients during the growing period. The leaves themselves become organic fertilizer when they fall. ''This tree is perfectly adapted for farming in the Sahel,'' said Dr. Larwanou. ''Yet it had all but disappeared from the region.'' That is because for generations local farmers had simply cleared their fields of all vegetation, including trees, before sowing neat rows of sorghum, millet, peanuts and beans. When a field became less productive, the farmer would move on to another. Wresting subsistence for 13 million people from Niger's fragile ecology is something akin to a puzzle. Less than 12 percent of its land can be cultivated, and much of that is densely populated. Yet 90 percent of Niger's people live off agriculture, cultivating a semiarid strip along the southern edge of the country. Farmers here practice mostly rain-fed agriculture with few tools and no machinery, making survival precarious even in so-called normal times. But when the rains and harvest fall short, hunger returns with a particular vengeance, as it did in 2005 during the nation's worst food crisis in a generation. Making matters worse, Niger's population has doubled in the last 20 years. Each woman bears about seven children, giving the country one of the highest growth rates in the world. The regrowth of trees increases the income of rural farmers, cushioning the boom and bust cycle of farming and herding. Ibrahim Idy, a farmer in Dahirou, a village in the Zinder region, has 20 baobab trees in his fields. Selling the leaves and fruit brings him about $300 a year in additional income. He has used that money to buy a motorized pump to draw water from his well to irrigate his cabbage and lettuce fields. His neighbors, who have fewer baobabs, use their children to draw water and dig and direct the mud channels that send water coursing to the beds. While their children work the fields, Mr. Idy's children attend school. In some regions, swaths of land that had fallen out of use are being reclaimed, using labor-intensive but inexpensive techniques. In the village of Koloma Baba, in the Tahoua region just south of the desert's edge, a group of widows have reclaimed fields once thought forever barren. The women dig small pits in plots of land as hard as asphalt. They place a shovelful of manure in the pits, then wait for rain. The pits help the water and manure stay in the soil and regenerate its fertility, said Dr. Larwanou. Over time, with careful tending, the land can regain its ability to produce crops. In this manner, more than 600,000 acres of land have been reclaimed, according to researchers. Still, Koloma Baba also demonstrates the limits of this fragile ecosystem, where disaster is always one missed rainfall away. Most able-bodied young men migrate to Nigeria and beyond in search of work, supporting their families with remittances. The women struggle to eke a modest crop from their fields. ''I produce enough to eat, but nothing more,'' said Hadijatou Moussa, a widow in Koloma Baba. The women have managed to grow trees on their fields as well, but have not seen much profit from them. People come and chop their branches without permission, and a village committee that is supposed to enforce the rights of farmers to their trees does not take action against poachers. Such problems raise the question of whether the success of some of Niger's farmers can be replicated on a larger scale, across the Sahel. While Niger's experience of greening on a vast scale is unique, scientists say, smaller tracts of land have been revived in other countries. ''It really requires the effort of the whole community,'' said Dr. Larwanou. ''If farmers don't take action themselves and the community doesn't support it, farmer-managed regeneration cannot work.'' Moussa Bara, the chief of Dansaga, a village in the Ague region of Niger, where the regeneration has been a huge success, said the village has benefited enormously from the regrowth of trees. He said not a single child died of malnutrition in the hunger crisis that gripped Niger in 2005, largely because of extra income from selling firewood. Still, he said, the village has too many mouths to feed. ''We are many and the land is small,'' he explained, bouncing on his lap a little boy named Ibrahim, the youngest of his 17 children by his three wives. Climate change is another looming threat. Kerry H. Cook, a professor of atmospheric science at Cornell University, said that improved rains in the Sahel are most likely a result of natural climate variability from decade to decade, and that while the trend is positive, the rains have not entirely recovered to what they were in the 1950s. The Sahel, like other parts of Africa, has experienced big swings in rainfall in recent years. Severe droughts in eastern and southern Africa have led to serious hunger crises in the past five years, and a drop in precipitation in Niger in 2005 contributed to the food crisis here that year. Dr. Cook's long-term projections, based on a variety of climate models, point to longer and more frequent dry periods in the Sahel, caused by rising temperatures in the Gulf of Guinea. ''This is the place in the world that just stands out for having vulnerability for drought,'' she said. Still, more trees mean that Niger's people are in a better position to withstand whatever changes the climate might bring. ''This is something the farmers control, and something they do for themselves,'' said Dr. Larwanou. ''It demonstrates that with a little effort and foresight, you can reduce poverty in the Sahel. It is not impossible or hopeless, and does not have to cost a lot of money. It can be done.''"
"High above the desert floor, this little alpine town has long served as a natural air-conditioned retreat for people in Tucson, one of the so-called sky islands of southern Arizona. When it is 105 degrees in the city, it is at least 20 degrees cooler up here near the 9,157-foot summit of Mount Lemmon. But for the past 10 years or so, things have been unraveling. Winter snows melt away earlier, longtime residents say, making for an erratic season at the nearby ski resort, the most southern in the nation. Legions of predatory insects have taken to the forest that mantles the upper mountain, killing trees weakened by record heat. And in 2003, a fire burned for a month, destroying much of the town and scarring more than 87,000 acres. The next year, another fire swept over 32,000 acres. ''Nature is confused,'' said Debbie Fagan, who moved here 25 years ago after crossing the country in pursuit of the perfect place to live. ''We used to have four seasons. Now we have two. I love this place dearly, and this is very hard for me to watch.'' The American Southwest has been warming for nearly 30 years, according to records that date to the late 19th century. And the region is in the midst of an eight-year drought. Both developments could be within the range of natural events. But what has convinced many scientists that the current spate of higher temperatures is not just another swing in the weather has been the near collapse of the sky islands and other high, formerly green havens that poke above the desert. Fire has always been a part of Western ecology, particularly when the land is parched. But since the late 1980s, the size and reach of the fires have far exceeded times of earlier droughts. And the culprit, according to several recent studies, is higher temperatures tearing at a fabric of life that dates to the last ice age. ''A lot of people think climate change and the ecological repercussions are 50 years away,'' said Thomas W. Swetnam, director of the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona in Tucson. ''But it's happening now in the West. The data is telling us that we are in the middle of one of the first big indicators of climate change impacts in the continental United States.'' And it comes at a time when millions of Americans are moving to these places. Since 1990, more than eight million homes have been built in Western areas that foresters call ''the urban-wild land'' interface, also the focus of recent federal firefighting efforts. The fear is that what happened to Summerhaven is a taste of things to come. As heat-stressed ecosystems provide fuel at the edges of new homes, catastrophic fires could become the new normal. Dr. Swetnam compares it to new developments in hurricane-prone areas in the Southeast. Others say the projections are overly alarmist, and note that fuel buildup is a legacy of fire repression, not necessarily higher temperatures. They also say the higher reaches of the West may simply be evolving into less alpine settings, and could resemble life that exists at lower elevations. Still, there is a broad consensus that much of the West is warmer than it has been since record keeping began, and that changes are happening quickly, particularly in places like the sky islands. ''The West has warmed more than any other place in the United States outside Alaska,'' said Jonathan T. Overpeck, a University of Arizona scientist and co-author of the recent draft by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released last month in Paris. A trip up to any one of the 27 sky islands shows the ravages of heat on the land. The forests are splotched with a rusty tinge, as trees die from beetle infestation. Frogs with a 10,000-year-old pedigree have all but disappeared. One of the sky islands is the world's only habitat for the Mount Graham red squirrel, an endangered species down to its last 100 or so animals. For the squirrel, the frog and other species that have retreated ever higher, there may be no place left to go. ''As the climate warms, these species on top of the sky islands are literally getting pushed off into space,'' Dr. Overpeck said. The Coronado National Forest, which includes Mount Lemmon and Mount Graham, lists 28 threatened or endangered species. Heat has greatly diminished the web of life that these creatures depend on, and they ''have not evolved to tolerate these new conditions,'' Forest Service officials wrote in a report on the declining health of the sky islands. For people moving to the breezy pines to escape desert heat, the fires that swept through places like Summerhaven can be terrifying. Fire comes much earlier, and much later, in the season. ''You can tell the weather is changing,'' said Michael Stanley, head of the water district here, which lost two-thirds of its customers after the fire. ''The snow melts earlier. The fires are big. It makes life very interesting.'' On her regular hikes around Mount Lemmon, Ms. Fagan has noticed many changes. She recently saw a type of rattlesnake that usually lives in the lowlands, and -- while hiking over snow -- was surrounded by gnats. ''I'm standing on snow while swatting away gnats,'' she said. ''I said, 'Oh my God, what are these guys doing out in the winter?' '' Last year, wildfires burned nearly 10 million acres in the United States -- a record, surpassing the previous year. The Forest Service has become the fire service, devoting 42 percent of its budget to fire suppression last year -- more than triple what it was in 1991. The current drought is not nearly as bad as the one in the 1950s, or one in the mid-16th century, but it has caused a huge forest die-off. The only difference this time around is higher temperatures, said David D. Breshears, co-author of a study published by the National Academy of Sciences on the subject. The increased heat, Dr. Breshears believes, is the tipping point -- stressing ecosystems in the Southwest so quickly that they are vulnerable to prolonged beetle infestation and catastrophic fires. ''The changes are so big, and happening so fast,'' Dr. Breshears said. ''We saw it happen all the way up the elevation grade and across the region.'' Dr. Swetnam, who said he used to be skeptical about some of the projections on Western landscape changes, came to a different conclusion after studying fires. Since the mid-1980s, about seven times more federal land has burned than in the previous time frame, he found, and the fire season has been extended by more than two months. Dr. Swetnam laments the loss of areas unique to the Southwest. ''The sky islands have existed since the Pleistocene,'' he said, ''and now with these huge fires you stand to lose some unique species.'' All of which should be a caution to people moving to reaches of the desert prone to dramatic change. ''The Chamber of Commerce doesn't like people like me saying things like this, but large parts of the arid Southwest are not going to be very nice places to live,'' Dr. Swetnam said. Here at Summerhaven, Ms. Fagan, who lost her home and gift shop to the fire, is staying put, even though she knows -- firsthand -- about the changes under way on the sky island where she built a business and raised her two boys. She made her last mortgage payment on her house a few months before the fire took it. ''We lost 90 percent of our community and two-thirds of our mountain to fire,'' she said recent one warm morning. ''There maybe nothing left to burn. But I can't ever leave this place. I love it too much.'' Warming Trends This is the second in a series of articles looking at how climate change is affecting American life. A previous article examined the effect on the maple syrup industry in Vermont. Warming Trends Correction: March 31, 2007, Saturday A front-page article on Tuesday about the effects that higher temperatures have had on the so-called sky islands of Southern Arizona misstated the year that fire destroyed 32,000 acres near Mount Lemmon, Ariz. It was 2002, not 2004."
"A Western drought that began in 1999 has continued after the respite of a couple of wet years that now feel like a cruel tease. But this time people in the driest states are not just scanning the skies and hoping for rescue. Some $2.5 billion in water projects are planned or under way in four states, the biggest expansion in the West's quest for water in decades. Among them is a proposed 280-mile pipeline that would direct water to Las Vegas from northern Nevada. A proposed reservoir just north of the California-Mexico border would correct an inefficient water delivery system that allows excess water to pass to Mexico. In Yuma, Ariz., federal officials have restarted an idled desalination plant, long seen as a white elephant from a bygone era, partly in the hope of purifying salty underground water for neighboring towns. The scramble for water is driven by the realities of population growth, political pressure and the hard truth that the Colorado River, a 1,400-mile-long silver thread of snowmelt and a lifeline for more than 20 million people in seven states, is providing much less water than it had. According to some long-term projections, the mountain snows that feed the Colorado River will melt faster and evaporate in greater amounts with rising global temperatures, providing stress to the waterway even without drought. This year, the spring runoff is expected to be about half its long-term average. In only one year of the last seven, 2005, has the runoff been above average. Everywhere in the West, along the Colorado and other rivers, as officials search for water to fill current and future needs, tempers are flaring among competing water users, old rivalries are hardening and some states are waging legal fights. In one of the most acrimonious disputes, Montana filed a suit in February at the United States Supreme Court accusing Wyoming of taking more than its fair share of water from the Tongue and Powder Rivers, north-flowing tributaries of the Yellowstone River that supply water for farms and wells in both states. Preparing for worst-case outcomes, the seven states that draw water from the Colorado River -- Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico in the upper basin and California, Arizona and Nevada in the lower basin -- and the United States Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the river, are considering plans that lay out what to do if the river cannot meet the demand for water, a prospect that some experts predict will occur in about five years. ''What you are hearing about global warming, explosive growth -- combine with a real push to set aside extra water for environmental purpose -- means you got a perfect situation for a major tug-of-war contest,'' said Sid Wilson, the general manager of the Central Arizona Project, which brings Colorado River water to the Phoenix area. New scientific evidence suggests that periodic long, severe droughts have become the norm in the Colorado River basin, undermining calculations of how much water the river can be expected to provide and intensifying pressures to find new solutions or sources. The effects of the drought can be seen at Lake Mead in Nevada, where a drop in the water level left docks hanging from newly formed cliffs, and a marina surrounded by dry land. Upriver at Lake Powell, which is at its lowest level since spring 1973, receding waters have exposed miles of mud in the side canyons leading to the Glen Canyon Dam. In California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has sounded alarm bells by pushing for a ballot measure in 2008 that would allocate $4.5 billion in bonds for new water storage in the state. The water content in the Sierra Nevada snowpack has reached the lowest level in about two decades, state hydrologists have reported, putting additional pressure on the nation's most populous state to find and store more water. ''Scientists say that global warming will eliminate 25 percent of our snowpack by the half of this century,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said recently in Fresno, Calif., ''which will mean less snow stored in the mountains, which will mean more flooding in the winter and less drinking water in the summer.'' In Montana, where about two-thirds of the Missouri River and half of the Columbia River have their headwaters, officials have embarked on a long-term project to validate old water-rights claims in an effort to legally shore up supplies the state now counts on. Under the West's water laws, claims are hierarchal. The oldest, first-filed claims, many dating to pioneer days, get water first, with newer claims at the bottom of the pecking order. Still, some of the sharpest tensions stem more from population growth than cautionary climate science, especially those between Nevada and Utah, states with booming desert economies and clout to fight for what they say is theirs. Las Vegas, the fastest-growing major city in the country, and the driest, developed the pipeline plan several years ago to bring groundwater from the rural, northern reaches of the state. The metropolitan area, which relies on the Colorado River for 90 percent of its water, is awaiting approval from Nevada's chief engineer. Ranchers and farmers in northern Nevada and Utah are opposed to the pipeline plan and have vowed to fight it in court, saying it smacks of the famous water grab by Los Angeles nearly a century ago that caused severe environmental damage in the Owens Valley in California. ''Southern Nevada thinks it can come up here and suck all these springs dry without any problems,'' said Dean Baker, whose family's ranch straddles the Nevada-Utah border, pointing out springs that farmers have run dry with their own wells. ''We did this ourselves. Now imagine what pumping for a whole big city is going to do.'' Meanwhile, Utah has proposed a $500 million, 120-mile pipeline from Lake Powell to serve the fast-growing City of St. George and Washington County in the state's southwestern corner. Nevada officials have said they will seek to block that plan if Utah stands in the way of theirs. ''Utah is being very disingenuous, and we're calling them on it,'' said Patricia Mulroy, the chief executive of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, the agency responsible for finding water for Las Vegas and its suburbs. ''St. George, Utah, is growing as fast as southern Nevada, because the growth is going right up the I-15 corridor.'' Dennis J. Strong, director of the Utah Division of Water Resources, said Nevada was protesting too much and instead should be cheering the Lake Powell project because Colorado River water that Utah does not use would flow in Nevada's direction. Mr. Strong said that Nevada's protests ''may be a bargaining chip.'' He said he hoped for a compromise that would allow both projects to move forward. In Yuma, near the Arizona border with Mexico, officials have pinned hopes on a desalination plant built 15 years ago. The plan then had been to treat salty runoff from farms before it made its way into Colorado River headed to Mexico, thus meeting the terms of an old water treaty. But a series of unusually wet years made it more efficient to meet the treaty obligations with water from Lake Mead, so the plant sat idle. Drought has changed all that. Arizona water managers, who are first in line to have their water cut in a shortage under an agreement with other states, called for the plant to be turned on. Under an agreement with environmentalists, the federal Bureau of Reclamation plans to monitor the environmental effects of using the plant, and study, among other things, using the purified water for purposesother than meeting its treaty obligations, like supplying the growing communities around Yuma. ''It never made sense to me to just dump bottled-water quality water into the river anyway,'' said Jim Cherry, the bureau's Yuma area manager. What unites the Western states is a growing consensus among scientists that future climate change and warmer temperatures, if they continue, could hit harder here than elsewhere in the continental United States. ''The Western mountain states are by far more vulnerable to the kinds of change we've been talking about compared to the rest of the country, with the New England states coming in a relatively distant second,'' said Michael Dettinger, a research hydrologist at the United States Geological Survey who studies the relationships between water and climate. Mr. Dettinger said higher temperatures had pushed the spring snowmelt and runoff to about 10 days earlier on average than in the past. Higher temperatures would mean more rain falling rather than snow, compounding issues of water storage and potentially affecting flooding. In some places, the new tensions and pressures could even push water users toward compromise. Colorado recently hired a mediator to try to settle a long-running dispute over how water from the Rocky Mountains should be shared among users in the Denver area and the western half of the state. Denver gets most of the water and has most of the state's population. But water users in the mountains, notably the ski resort industry, also have clout and want to keep their share. Robert W. Johnson, the Bureau of Reclamation commissioner, said he shared the optimism that the disputes could be worked out, but he said he thought it might take a reconsideration of the West's original conception of what water was for. The great dams and reservoirs that were envisioned beginning in the 1800s were conceived with farmers in mind, and farmers still take about 90 percent of the Colorado River's flow. More and more, Mr. Johnson said, the cities will need that water. An agreement reached a few years ago between farmers and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, the chief supplier of water to that region, is one model. Under the terms of the agreement, farmers would let their fields lie fallow and send water to urban areas in exchange for money to cover the crop losses. ''I definitely see that as the future,'' Mr. Johnson said. Correction: April 9, 2007, Monday A front-page article on Wednesday about the drought in the West referred incorrectly to the level of Lake Powell on the Utah-Arizona border. While the lake is at the same level it was in 1973, it is not the lowest it has been since then. It was briefly lower in early 2005."
"Surely of all God's creations, none is more beautiful than the sunrise on the Masai Mara grassland, Kenya's spectacular nature reserve and a backdrop for the movie ''Out of Africa.'' The sun's ascent here is like a curtain going up on one of Mother Nature's richest ecosystems. Through the day you can be greeted by a bull elephant in hot pursuit of a cow, serenaded by tropical boubou birds, intimidated by two lionesses devouring a warthog, amused by the cattle egrets riding on the backs of African buffalos and impressed by how each small cluster of topi antelope ''assigns'' one topi to stand on a small hill and keep watch for predators while the others graze. Everything seems in perfect balance. Except behind the curtain, deforestation, the poaching of wildlife and now climate change present a trio of threats to the Mara, which have Kenyans, and all those concerned about biodiversity, worried. Over the last 10 years, ''the weather has changed,'' explained our Masai naturalist, Daniel Memusi. ''All of a sudden it is becoming unpredictable. April has always been a rainy month -- every afternoon and all night. You expect rain, but no rain.'' If the few scattered rains this April don't become more intense, he added, the farmers who just planted their crops will have serious problems. ''This should be a very wet month for anyone who knows the Mara, but instead the rains came in January and February,'' he said. One should never extrapolate about climate change from any single ecosystem or brief period. But as The Times's environmental reporter Andrew C. Revkin recently noted, scientists say it's increasingly clear ''that worldwide precipitation is shifting away from the equator and toward the poles.'' ''Rainfall has changed dramatically in the last 30 years -- it is less predictable now,'' said Julius Kipng'etich, director of the Kenya Wildlife Service, which manages Kenya's Noah's ark of endangered species. If climate changes bring more severe droughts and floods, and the animal migrations are disrupted, ''the brand of the Mara dies,'' added Mr. Kipng'etich, referring to Kenya's ''Lion King'' grassland. That would really hurt Kenya's economy. ''When every Kenyan meets a wild animal, they should bow and say thank you.'' Kenya also has to worry about deforestation and poaching, although poaching is now under better control. Kenya's forests have been reduced from 10 percent of the country's landmass at the time of its independence in 1963 to 2 percent today, while in the same period its elephant population went from 170,000 to 30,000 and its rhino population from 20,000 to around 500. ''When you see a rhino today, you are very lucky,'' said Mr. Kipng'etich. ''Your children or grandchildren may never see one.'' Climate change could worsen this. The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change just concluded that two-thirds of the atmospheric buildup of heat-trapping carbon dioxide has come -- in roughly equal parts -- from the U.S. and Western Europe. These countries have the resources to deal with climate change, and may even benefit from some warming. Africa accounts for less than 3 percent of global CO2 emissions since 1900, the report noted, yet its 840 million people could suffer enormously from global-warming-induced droughts and floods and have the fewest resources to deal with them. ''We have a message here to tell these countries, that you are causing aggression to us by causing global warming,'' President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda told an African Union summit in Ethiopia last February. ''Alaska will probably become good for agriculture, Siberia will probably become good for agriculture, but where does that leave Africa?'' A study by Oxfam, entitled ''Africa -- Up in Smoke,'' noted that in line with climate models, droughts in northwest Kenya appear to becoming more frequent. It profiled the impact on the nomadic pastoralists of Kenya's northwest Turkana region, who graze cattle, camels and goats. They've always known droughts, but because they are now more frequent, families and animals have less chance to recover. The Turkana people, said Oxfam, call this more persistent drought '' 'Atiaktiak ng'awiyei' or 'the one that divided homes' because so many families split up to survive, migrating in all directions.'' It really is wrong that those least responsible for climate change should pay the most. ''My recommendation is that the biggest polluter pays,'' said Mr. Kipng'etich. ''We are one planet, one system.'' He has a point. He deserves an answer. Op-Ed Columnist"
"The hills and palm trees have turned sepia, the winds crackle and the skin of many Angelenos, with the texture and appearance of unpeeled onions, needs a slathering of cream. The winter rainy season here has been the driest in well over a century. Much of Southern California and broad swaths of the West are also suffering -- and fearing next a season of virulent fires. Since last July, it has rained a mere 2.4 inches in downtown Los Angeles, far below the 15-inch average for the same period, the driest it has been since 1877. The already arid Antelope Valley just north of the city has had about 10 percent of its normal rainfall -- less than an inch -- and Burbank is barely better off. The state's overall snow pack is about 40 percent of its normal level, the lowest since 1988. Throughout the West, a dry winter has parched places like Phoenix and Reno, Nev., where roughly half the normal amount of rain has fallen. But the situation in Southern California is particularly egregious. Every morning brings another grim march toward the lawn sprinklers and twitchy glances toward the ever-flammable hills. ''Southern California has been really hard hit,'' said Elissa Lynn, a senior meteorologist at the California Department of Water Resources. Thanks to heavy rains last year, particularly in the north, Ms. Lynn said, the state's reservoirs remain in good shape and a serious drought is not in the offing. But the dry weather, compounded by dry vegetation left by an unusually harsh freeze over the winter and a very windy spring have raised the specter of frequent powerful fires throughout Southern California. ''You have very dry, very dead fuel out there,'' said Jamie Meier, a meteorologist with the Los Angeles office of the National Weather Service. ''It has the potential to be a difficult fire season.'' Brush fires, less common in the winter months, have been numerous this year. There have been more than a dozen in Ventura County alone. Last week, three homes burned in Beverly Hills, where flames were whipped by unseasonably high winds. Ventura County never ended the official fire season that began last spring and now is bracing for a tough summer. ''Fire season is a year-round event for us now,'' said Bob Roper, fire chief for Ventura County. ''Right now what we're seeing is that the fuel conditions are already at a critical level and Southern California has had a lot of wind conditions. All I can say is conditions are present to have a really bad season.'' The normal fire season in Southern California tends to begin at the end of May, but many local departments said they will start the official season at the end of this month. Firefighters will respond in greater numbers to calls around the state and monitor weather conditions closely. Near the Hollywood sign, where a brush fire burned nearby this spring, the dried brush and sand have combined to create a landscape more like the high desert's than like the postcard image of palm trees with dabs of green. Now, its hill is a tinderbox looming over the city. A lack of green plant life, which retards fire growth, raises further concerns among fire officials. ''Certainly looking at the numbers and looking at the vegetation, it looks July already out there,'' said John R. Todd, chief of the forestry division of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. ''Another building concern is that we had a huge rain year in 2005 and all that growth is available to become fuel.'' A lack of precipitation has crinkled plants, shortened ski seasons and withered the land in large sections of Arizona, Nevada, eastern regions in Oregon, and parts of northern Utah and southern Idaho, said Kelly T. Redmond, regional climatologist at the Western Regional Climate Center in Reno. Flagstaff, Ariz., for instance, has had almost half its usual 105 inches of snow this season. Only 2.2 inches of rain has fallen in Reno since Oct. 1, about 43 percent of normal levels. Two previous wet winters have kept the reservoirs along the Sierra Nevada amply supplied, enough to offset the effects of this dry season, Mr. Redmond said. ''A lot of the water interests are now looking ahead to next winter,'' Mr. Redmond added. ''If they get a second winter like this, they are going to be in a world of hurt.'' There are beneficiaries of the dry winter. Julia Sandoval, an aesthetician at the Ra Organic Spa in Burbank, has been living it up with creams containing alpha lipoic acid, an antioxidant. ''I have seen the dry season reflected on everyone's skin who comes in,'' Ms. Sandoval said."
"This state seems to seesaw perpetually between crises related to water: either too much or too little. Wednesday was no exception, as the retreating waters of drought-sapped Lake Okeechobee, a vital reservoir for millions of residents in dry times, sank toward a new low. Signaling the intensity of this once-a-century drought, roiling smoke clouds rose from exposed stretches of the saucerlike 730-square-mile basin midway between the crowded coasts. The plumes came from wildfires sweeping a 12,000-acre stretch of lakebed exposed as the waters retreated and sank about half an inch a day, water officials said. The flames fed on weeds and grasses that normally provide hiding places for bass, but are now baked by the sun and dehydrated by relentless winds. Officials at the South Florida Water Management District said the average lake depth on Wednesday matched the record low of 8.97 feet set in a long drought in 2001 and would certainly break the record overnight. ''This year is definitely a larger challenge than 2001,'' said Carol Wehle, executive director of the water district. ''We have drought all the way from Disney to Key West.'' Ms. Wehle said the easterly winds like those blowing over this town on the eastern shore of the lake were accelerating the drop in water by speeding evaporation. ''Add to that warmer temperatures and lots of sunshine and when it gets this dry it doesn't take much for the fire to spread,'' she said. Thunderstorms predicted for this week, even a hurricane or two, are unlikely to end the water woes, Ms. Wehle said. ''We need feet of rain, but coming every day throughout the summer,'' she said. ''When you have one big storm dumping a lot of water, the system can't catch it.''"
"The severe drought in South Florida had an upside for state water management officials who took advantage of the low water levels in Lake Okeechobee and began giving the lake bed a good cleaning. At an almost record low of 9.2 feet, the lake's water level exposed areas where oozy and polluted muck sediment containing decomposed organic matter had accumulated, covering most of the lake bed at depths of more than a foot. Officials from the South Florida Water Management District brought in bulldozers and dump trucks to several sites around the lake on Thursday to scrape the muck and expose the natural bottom in an effort to promote the regrowth of submerged aquatic vegetation and shoreline marshes, which had been suffering since the active 2004 hurricane season. The hurricanes that hit the state in 2004 and 2005 stirred up the muck, keeping sunlight from plants and lowering water clarity in the 730-square-mile lake. In just one site, water management officials expect to take about three months to dredge out 500,000 cubic yards of muck from 800 acres of lake bed. ''This is the silver lining to a drought condition,'' said Susan Gray, Lake Okeechobee program director at the South Florida Water Management District. ''It's a mixed blessing because we have to deal with the drought, but in terms of the lake itself, it's beneficial.'' The removal will also improve fish habitat by exposing the sandy areas that fish need to lay their eggs, Dr. Gray said. Earlier this month, the agency's governing board approved more than $11 million for the project, which is expected to remove a total of 3.8 million cubic yards of muck and 280 tons of phosphorous. The excavated material will be encircled by a berm along a nearby canal before its disposal is coordinated with local landowners who have expressed interest in using it, Dr. Gray said. The agency conducted a similar muck-removal project during the 2001 drought, when the lake's water level dropped below nine feet, the record low. Florida is facing one of its worst droughts ever recorded, with 41 inches of rain having fallen across the southern half of the state over the last year, more than 10 inches below the average."
"Even as a drought and unprecedented water restrictions strip many Florida lawns of their lushness, Mark Harding has few takers for the artificial grass he sells from a showroom here. Inquiries are up, he said, but swapping turf for less thirsty alternatives remains hard for Floridians to get their heads around. ''People are just starting to look at it,'' said Mr. Harding, a transplant from Buffalo who admits to having replaced only a piece of his own lawn with the fake stuff. ''It's right in its infancy stage.'' The same might be said for awareness that Florida's water supply, seemingly endless given the abundance of springs, lakes, canals, aquifers and rainfall, is not. Many regions have all but depleted their groundwater supply, yet they have barely begun planning new water sources or enforcing conservation measures. Meanwhile, residential water bills in Florida's urban areas -- averaging $32 a month in Miami, for example -- have remained much lower than those in many other cities. ''We now face the scarcity, the spending and the spectacle that used to be unique to the arid West,'' said Cynthia Barnett, the author of ''Mirage: Florida and the Vanishing Water of the Eastern U.S.'' But Ms. Barnett and others who study Florida's water use say that unlike out West, a sense of urgency has not taken hold here, nor have government agencies taken the politically thorny steps some scientists say are necessary. The South Florida Water Management District, whose political appointees regulate water use in some of the thirstiest counties, is only now considering permanent, year-round watering restrictions. Many cities and homeowner associations still require grass lawns, blocking alternatives like sturdy ground cover, drought-resistant plants or Mr. Harding's artificial turf. On Marco Island, near Naples, city officials made a homeowner get rid of $15,000 worth of artificial grass in 2005 on the grounds that it was offensive and might pose environmental risks. (He protested by painting his house with polka dots.) In the Villages, a vast retirement community near Orlando, a resident tried replacing sod with plantings that required less water, only to be rebuffed by the developer. (Worth noting: Kentucky bluegrass, the soft, archetypal grass of the Northeast and the Midwest, does not grow here. Instead, Florida's trademark turf is St. Augustine grass, coarse, tough on bare feet and often laid on the ground in strips, not seeded.) Changing the rules on lawns could be significant, since Florida households -- especially those with automatic irrigation systems, which are increasingly common -- use up to 75 percent of their water outdoors. ''The most important incentive we can establish is limiting lawn watering,'' said Amy Vickers, an engineer and consultant who is helping Orange County rewrite its water conservation ordinance. ''It's reasonable and fair, and something I think we've got to learn to live with.'' In Southeast Florida, the restrictions in place since March -- twice-a-week watering in some areas, once a week in others -- have been erratically enforced. Wellington, a wealthy community in Palm Beach County known for its polo grounds, has issued more than 2,200 water violations. But Miami Beach has issued none. To date, only the Tampa Bay region has faced a serious water crisis, after Pinellas County pumped too much groundwater from areas to its north in the 1980s. The region built a $158 million seawater desalination plant, but it has been fraught with problems and had to shut down for almost two years. Other parts of the state are now under pressure to plan similar projects because in 2005, the Legislature required cities and counties to prove they will have enough water for any new development. The law has been a wakeup call for counties like Miami-Dade and Broward, which reuse only a tiny part of their wastewater and flush the rest into the ocean or injection wells deep underground. In 2004, Miami-Dade asked to add 100 million gallons of water a day over the next two decades to the 346 million gallons a day it already uses. The county appeared shocked by the state's response last year: that it could not keep tapping the Biscayne Aquifer, its cheap, longtime water source, and must create alternatives. The county is planning to spend $4.5 billion on projects like a high-tech wastewater disinfection plant over the coming decades. As the prospect of costly water projects looms, so do water wars reminiscent of those that have raged for years in the West. Orange County, home of Disney World, riled neighbors by requesting an additional 14 million gallons of groundwater a day, a 30 percent increase, over the next two decades. And residents of North Florida were outraged in 2003 when a group of developers urged the transfer of water from that region to the more crowded South Florida. For now, the state has pledged $60 million a year to help subsidize water projects from the Panhandle to the Keys. Where the rest will come from remains unclear, as does the wisdom of some of the proposed projects. Ms. Vickers said more studies were needed on the safety of treated wastewater, the main alternative source counties are eyeing. ''What are the long-term impacts on health and the environment?'' she asked. ''I don't think we know.'' Since rain will keep falling in Florida -- even now, after some of the driest months on record, South Florida has started seeing deluges again -- cities here may never press conservation to the extent that many of their Western counterparts do, offering homeowners cash for every square foot of turf they tear up and rebates for water-efficient toilets and appliances. Yet some places are trying. After the 2001 drought, Ms. Barnett said, Sarasota County kept tough water-use rules in place and reduced its per-capita consumption to 90 gallons a day, compared with the state average of 174. Broward County now encourages homeowners to replace grass with native plants that need little water, sending out consultants who have helped remake 1,600 lawns. But it runs into trouble with homeowners' associations that still require grass. ''Until these older communities change their bylaws,'' said Diana Guidry, a Broward County official, ''a lot of people will meet resistance.'' Marilyn Barber, whose yard was a carpet of grass when she moved to Broward County a decade ago, replaced all but 10 percent with plants that need watering only once a week. ''Just like cars get smaller when gas gets high enough,'' Mrs. Barber said, ''if water becomes expensive or there isn't enough of it, people will say, 'Gee, I really can't afford to have grass.' '' For now -- at least in Southeast Florida -- that seems unlikely. More than eight inches of rain have fallen so far this month in Broward and Palm Beach Counties, compared with about three inches throughout May. [On Thursday, the South Florida Water Management District announced it was likely to ease the water restrictions soon.]"
"Few places are more vulnerable to drought than Africa. From the Sahel south of the Sahara to the southern lobe of the turbulent continent, there is a simple calculus, said Dr. Richard Washington, an expert on the region's climate at Oxford: ''When the rains fail, people die.'' So a concerted effort has been made over the last five years to understand what drives dry spells there and what will occur in a future warmed by accumulating heat-trapping emissions in the atmosphere. Most climate experts now say that significant human-caused warming is inevitable. One new study bodes particularly poorly for southern Africa, indicating that a 50-year-long drying trend there is likely to continue and appears tightly linked to substantial warming of the Indian Ocean. The authors of the study say that the heating of that ocean, which lacks the natural variability of the Pacific and Atlantic, is one of the clearest fingerprints pointing to human-caused climate change. ''In our models, the Indian Ocean shows very clear and dramatic warming into the future, which means more and more drought for southern Africa,'' said Dr. James W. Hurrell, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., and an author of the study. ''It is consistent with what we would expect from an increase in greenhouse gases.'' Dr. Hurrell is to present the findings today at a geophysics conference in New Orleans. The study compared the observed 20th-century changes in the oceans and weather patterns with 60 simulations of climate run on five computer models developed by different research centers. The other researchers were Dr. Martin P. Hoerling and Dr. Jon K. Eischeid of the Commerce Department's Climate Diagnostics Center, also in Boulder. Dr. Hurrell said the warming ocean changes the circulation of the atmosphere, causing more air to rise over the water, generating marine storms and rains, while at the same time causing the opposite motion in air masses over the adjacent continent, leading to less rain. By midcentury, he said, there could be a 10 to 20 percent drying in the February-to-April wet season compared with the average for the last half of the 20th century. For the Sahel, beset by drought and famine for generations, the picture is less clear. The new study projects rainier times there as the boundary between warm and cooler portions of the Atlantic Ocean shifts. But other experts on African climate still see evidence that the Sahelian drought pattern could worsen. Dr. Kerry H. Cook, an atmospheric scientist at Cornell, said the frequency of extremely dry years matters more to vulnerable populations than longer-term shifts in average rainfall. She said such extreme dry seasons were directly related to warm temperatures in the Gulf of Guinea, the Atlantic waters beneath the westward bulge of central Africa. Most climate experts agree that this gulf will warm as global temperatures rise, Dr. Cook said. If emissions of greenhouse gases are not curbed, she added, new computer simulations show that there could be twice as many ''really harmful dry years'' in the latter half of this century as there were in the late 20th century. Other experts on African climate said that uncertainties in projections were likely to remain high as long as big gaps persist in collecting basic meteorological data. For the moment, those gaps are not likely to close, largely because of political turmoil in many African countries and a lack of attention by wealthier nations, said Dr. Washington at Oxford. He was the lead author of a British report last year on African climate variability and trends that concluded, ''The African climate-observing system is in a worse state than that on any continent and is deteriorating.''"
"The Amazon River basin, the world's largest rain forest, is grappling with a devastating drought that in some areas is the worst since record keeping began a century ago. It has evaporated whole lagoons and kindled forest fires, killed off fish and crops, stranded boats and the villagers who travel by them, brought disease and wreaked economic havoc. In mid-October, the governor of Amazonas State, Eduardo Braga, decreed a ''state of public calamity,'' which remains in effect as the drought's impact on the economy, public health and food and fuel supplies deepens. But other Brazilian states have also been severely affected, as have Amazon regions in neighboring countries like Peru, Bolivia and Colombia. With hundreds of riverside settlements cut off from the outside world, the Brazilian Armed Forces have for three months mounted what officials describe as the biggest relief operation that they and civil defense agencies have carried out together. Nearly 2,000 tons of food and 30 tons of medicine have already been airlifted by plane and helicopter to affected communities just in Amazonas State, the region's largest. ''There have been years before in which we've had a deficit of rainfall, but we've never experienced drops in the water levels of rivers like those we have seen in 2005,'' said Everaldo Souza, a meteorologist at the Amazon Protection System, a Brazilian government agency in Manaus, the nine-state region's main city. ''It has truly been without precedent, and it looks like it is only going to be December or January, if then, that things return to normal.'' Scientists say the drought is most likely a result of the same rise in water temperatures in the tropical Atlantic Ocean that unleashed Hurricane Katrina. They also worry that if global warming is involved, as some of them suspect, it may be the beginning of a new era of more severe and frequent droughts in the region that accounts for nearly a quarter of the world's fresh water. ''The Amazon is a kind of canary-in-a-coal-mine situation,'' said Daniel C. Nepstad, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts and the Amazon Institute of Ecological Research in Belém. ''We have no idea of the game we have played into by running this worldwide experiment of pumping so much greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,'' Mr. Nepstad said. Even more than in other parts of the world, people who live in the world's largest rain forest depend on water for transportation, food, sewage removal -- in short, just about everything, so the drought has touched nearly every aspect of their lives. ''I am very frightened,'' said Jair Souto, the mayor of a sleepy market town, Manaquiri, that started seeing signs of drought in September. ''One thing goes wrong, and the entire system follows.'' In Acre State in western Brazil, parched trees turned to tinder, and the number of forest fires recorded tripled to nearly 1,500 at its peak in September compared with a year earlier. The resulting smoke, which may itself have intensified the drought by impeding the formation of storm clouds, was so thick on some days that residents took to wearing masks when they went outdoors. On the Madeira River, a main trade artery for products including soybeans and diesel oil, navigation had to be suspended when water levels fell to barely one-tenth of their rainy season level. Peasant farmers have watched their crops rot because they cannot ship them to market, and schools have shut down now that students can no longer get to class even in small boats. ''The water level wasn't but two fingers high, and the channel was choked in the grass that sprang up, so you couldn't even paddle a canoe,'' Rivaldo Castro Serrão, a peasant farmer in a hamlet on the Purus River, São Lázaro, said in late November as an army helicopter was delivering supplies to the 41 families living there. ''With the fish all dead and our watermelon and banana crop all rotted, we'd be starving if it weren't for the food packages the government brings.'' As water levels dropped, areas where the river normally flowed free instead became stagnant pools, the ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes. As a result, malaria, always a problem in the region, has become more prevalent and has further strained limited health care resources. A vast majority of communities rely on the river to carry away human waste. With sewage now accumulating near the settlements, the risk of cholera and other diseases is expected to rise with water levels when the rainy season, which is starting in some parts of the basin, finally arrives in earnest. Around larger towns like Manaquiri, peasants who fled the drought looking for aid and still cannot return home have formed floating slums. Horácio de Almeida Ramos, for example, has been marooned in Manaquiri since September, when river levels began falling as much as 20 inches a day. In October, the teeming schools of fish in the lagoon suddenly died off, and by November, the entire lagoon had dried up, leaving boats here stranded and outlying communities isolated. So Mr. Ramos lives, with his wife and their seven children, ranging in age from 2 to 15, in the canoe that brought them here and is now beached beside the pier. ''We're stuck here until the lagoon fills up again, living off charity and whatever make-work I can find,'' he said resignedly. ''We had to abandon all our crops, so I don't know what it's going to be like when we eventually go back.'' Even as the drought begins to subside, scientists are still debating what caused it. The explanation accepted most widely pins primary responsibility on higher water temperatures in tropical regions of the Atlantic Ocean, the same phenomenon being blamed for the increase in the number of hurricanes forming in the Northern Hemisphere this year. ''A warmer Atlantic not only helps give more energy to hurricanes, it also aids in evaporating air,'' said Luiz Gylvan Meira, a climate specialist at the Institute for Advanced Studies at the University of São Paulo. ''But when that air rises over the oceans in one region, it eventually has to come down somewhere else, thousands of miles away. In this case, it came down in the western Amazon, blocking the formation of clouds that would bring rain to the headwaters of the rivers that feed the Amazon.'' Whether the increases in deforestation registered in the Amazon in recent years have also played a role is less clear. The Brazilian government, often criticized for not doing enough to stop the depredations of loggers and ranchers, argues there is no direct connection, attributing the drought to larger external forces beyond the country's control. ''There are a lot of peculiar things happening on a large scale, like the tsunami, hurricanes and now this drought without precedent,'' Ciro Gomes, the minister of national integration, said in October, during a tour of the affected region. ''We should all be concerned and launch an alert to the world that irresponsible management of natural resources needs to cease, the sooner the better.'' In fact, some of the areas hardest hit by the drought are those that have done the most to limit or control deforestation. Here in Amazonas, which is larger than France, Germany, Britain and Italy combined, officials say that 98 percent of their forest remains intact but that they are suffering more than neighboring states where deforestation has been rampant. But river-dwellers old enough to remember the era before deforestation began on a large scale say that the cutting down of trees along rivers and lakes has aided in the accumulation of silt. As a result, they say, navigation channels that remained open even in the most severe of previous dry seasons are now blocked and choked. Research also suggests that the forest itself, and consequently the entire ecosystem, has been made more vulnerable by the drought. When deprived of an adequate ration of rainfall, trees instead drain water from the soil and curb the growth of their trunks, which are vital to their role in pulling immense quantities of carbon dioxide out of the air. ''Because droughts remain registered in the soil for up to four years, the situation is still very critical and precarious, and will remain so,'' Mr. Nepstad said. Where there are ''forests already teetering on the edge,'' he added, the prospect of ''massive tree mortality and greater susceptibility to fire'' must be considered. While scientists largely agree that higher temperatures in the Atlantic are responsible for the severity of this year's drought, they are still searching for an explanation for that phenomenon. It could be just a one-time disturbance, or it could be more permanent, perhaps brought on by greenhouse gas emissions. ''Yes, a global warming effect would explain increases in ocean temperatures, but no one is saying that yet, because it is still very early, and we don't yet have enough data,'' said Carlos Nobre, director of Brazil's National Institute of Space Research, which monitors climatic patterns in the Amazon. ''Droughts like this one are very rare, but one consequence of a warmer planet would be that they occur with more frequency, which is something we are going to have to be watching for.'' Local governments in the Amazon do not have the luxury of awaiting the results of that research, and they fear that the drought this year may not be an aberration. So they have already begun taking as many steps as their limited budgets will permit to prepare for a recurrence. In a region where water has always been abundant and taken for granted, programs are under way to build wells and cisterns. Warehouses to stock food, medicine and fuel are being built, in anticipation that communities may again be left isolated in the near future. ''We have become the victims of a phenomenon we did not provoke,'' said Mr. Braga, the governor of Amazonas. ''What is happening is not our fault. We didn't heat up the atmosphere or chop down our trees. But we are paying the price with the suffering of our people.''"
"Rick and Rhonda Richards drove two and a half hours last Monday from Nashville to Metropolis, Ill., to hit the slot machines there, only to find that Harrah's riverboat casino had closed two nights before for the most unexpected of reasons: low water levels on the Ohio River. A drought ravaging parts of the Midwest this summer had left the boat nearly on the river bottom, making it difficult to board and disembark. The couple had planned the two-day trip a month before to celebrate their 33rd wedding anniversary. But they never got word that Harrah's had closed because of low water -- the first time that has happened since the casino opened in 1993. ''We didn't know what was going on,'' Mr. Richards said. ''The parking lot was empty, the town was empty.'' As the worst drought since 1988 has deepened across parts of the Midwest, low-water levels are doing more than just inconveniencing gamblers. They are turning parts of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers into virtual sandbars, causing towboats and barges to run aground and delaying shipments of petroleum products, coal, chemicals, agricultural goods and road-paving materials. The delays are threatening construction projects throughout the region, and the higher transportation costs could ultimately make this year's harvest of corn and other crops too expensive for some international markets, commodity analysts and barge-shipping officials said. ''There is high anxiety that we are close to shutting down the river,'' said Lynn Muench, vice president for the midcontinent region of the American Waterways Operators, a trade group representing tugboat, towboat and barge operators. ''This is looking as bad or worse than 1988.'' Her fear was realized on Friday, when the Coast Guard ordered a seven-mile stretch of the Ohio River closed, north of its intersection with the Mississippi River. The drought, which has mostly affected parts of Illinois, Missouri and Wisconsin, has also dried up wells, caused insect infestations and wreaked havoc on corn and soybean fields. A government report on Friday confirmed that corn in Illinois, the second-biggest producer after Iowa, had suffered irreversible harm, with production down 12 percent from last year's record harvest. While showers have been falling across parts of the Midwest, including Chicago, in recent days, meteorologists from the National Weather Service are predicting more hot, dry weather in the eastern Corn Belt. As the parched-earth conditions continue in southern Illinois, barge operators and the Coast Guard are becoming increasingly concerned about how long they can keep the river traffic moving if the water levels continue to dip. Despite efforts by the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge trouble spots, barges continue to struggle to make their way through the river system. A towboat plying the Mississippi on Friday near Memphis struck the river bottom, causing its rudder to break off, Ms. Muench said. And near Cairo, Ill., where the Ohio and Mississippi rivers cross, a towboat pushing 13 barges carrying stone materials ran aground early Friday, finally freeing itself eight hours later. The Coast Guard restricted barge traffic through one seven-mile stretch of the Ohio River where it meets the Mississippi on Aug. 7 after the water level dropped to nine feet. A day later, the water dropped another foot and a half. Over the next three days the Guard worked with the shipping industry to lighten the loads of more than 40 vessels that were eventually eased through the trouble spot. The Coast Guard opened up traffic after a brief surge of water on Wednesday. But after consulting with the industry on Friday morning, it closed the river again, except for extreme need on a case-by-case basis. As of Sunday night, 43 towboats with an average of 15 barges each were immobilized in the area. ''We got a good bump of water, but it wasn't long lasting,'' said Commander Denise L. Matthews, who heads the Coast Guard unit in Paducah, Ky. ''Everything is going badly from a Mother Nature perspective.'' The Paducah office has been getting calls lately from construction firms in Indiana concerned about delayed asphalt shipments, and even from a British grain futures-trading firm wanting to know how long the low water levels would last. (Agricultural exports are typically shipped downriver between August and November.) Coast Guard officials are holding daily telephone conferences with industry representatives and the Army Corps of Engineers to develop strategies for finding at least a 180-foot-wide path for towboats to navigate through. Officers use a dry-erase board in the command center's main conference room to chart the size and draft of various barges trying to make it through the Ohio. Commander Matthews said she was hoping an Army Corps of Engineers boat that began dredging more of the area on Sunday would make a difference. The operation could take up to two weeks, she said. Lightening the barge loads is costly. The barge operators have been forced to load at 9 to 10 feet of draft, the depth of a boat's hull under the surface, down from a typical loading of about 12 feet. Losing one inch of draft typically means losing 17 tons of cargo on a single barge, and 255 tons on a typical 15-barge tow. A typical tractor-trailer truck rig carries about 26 tons. Idle towboats cost shipping companies $5,000 to $10,000 a day. ''Eventually the cost gets passed on to consumers,'' Ms. Muench said. Meanwhile, some companies are stockpiling coal, salt and sand ahead of winter, anticipating that the drought will continue to worsen over the next month, making the rivers impassable, Ms. Muench said. Meanwhile, crops have suffered in the relentless sun. In its report on Friday, the Agriculture Department said it expected corn yields to be lower this year in 29 of 33 corn states, with the largest decreases in Missouri, Illinois and Kansas. Soybean yields are also lower than last year, especially in Illinois and Missouri. ''These rains right now will help the soybean crop,'' said Dave Lehman, managing director of commodities at the Chicago Board of Trade. ''It is too late for corn.'' This year's drought is more localized than the severe ones in 1988 and 1997. With farmers in Iowa, Minnesota and Nebraska having a good year for corn, prices should remain relatively stable at the supermarket, said Dennis Vercler, a spokesman for the Illinois Farm Bureau. As the drought has deepened, farmers in Illinois have seen more damage from weeds and insects like aphids and Japanese beetles this year. Plants are under stress and cannot fight off the pests as well, and there has not been enough water to activate chemicals that would have warded them off, Mr. Vercler said. In general, however, farmers are not likely to suffer as much as in previous droughts, which led to widespread consolidation of farms and the thinning of rural populations. Farmers today have more federal crop insurance and generally less debt than they did in the mid-1980's. Still, Mr. Vercler said, ''It's just been no fun to be a farmer in Illinois this year.'' Nor has it been fun to be a riverboat casino operator. Late Wednesday the Harrah's casino reopened after workers made adjustments to the emergency stairs and an entrance. The riverboat is connected to land by a floating barge, and as the water level dropped, the barge came to rest on the river bottom. The boat, which is moored further out, continued to drop with the falling waters. As a result, the entrance to the riverboat had dropped more than a foot further than the barge, forcing any customer taller than 5-foot-8 to duck on the way in. The three days Harrah's was closed cost the casino an estimated $975,000 in lost revenues, said Robin Ryan, a Harrah's spokeswoman. Harrah's also paid for the Richards's hotel room for two days. ''We were sad at first, but it worked out,'' Mrs. Richards said from just outside the casino floor on Thursday night. ''I couldn't believe they closed because of low water. That was the strangest thing I ever heard.'' The casino has closed before after flooding on the river, most recently in January."
"The worsening drought in northern New Jersey has led to a rare squabble between two utilities over sharing dwindling supplies of water from three rivers in Passaic County. Routinely in past water shortages, the two utilities, which help provide water for about two million people, have amicably worked out arrangements for pumping water from the Passaic River and two of its tributaries, the Pompton and Ramapo. But that spirit of cooperation has faded as the current drought threatens to become as serious as those in 1964-65 and 1980-81, and officials scramble to pump as much river water as possible into North Jersey's reservoirs. Amid the growing anxieties about severe shortages this summer, one of the utilities, the Passaic Valley Water Commission, has complained to the state that the other is overpumping the Pompton and Ramapo Rivers, in violation of a state permit, and not leaving enough water to flow downstream toward its treatment plant in Totowa. The other utility, the North Jersey District Water Supply Commission, denied Passaic Valley's charge today and said it was complying with state regulations. New Jersey's water supply administrator, Shing-Fu Hsueh, and his aides in the Department of Environmental Protection stepped into the fray today in hopes of calming the utilities and resolving the dispute. The state officials talked with officials from both sides in meetings and conference calls. Afterward, they would not comment but said the discussions would continue on Monday. The quarrel is surprising because the two utilities are sister governmental agencies that have long cooperated in providing water to residents of Paterson, Clifton and Passaic. But a yearlong shortage of precipitation has depleted streams, rivers and reservoirs throughout New Jersey, and 20 of its 21 counties are now under a state-imposed drought warning. Residents statewide have been asked to conserve water. State water supply officials have focused on transferring as much water as possible from streams and rivers to reservoirs before demand increases this spring and summer. The reservoir systems that serve Newark, Paterson, Jersey City and scores of suburban communities in Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Passaic Counties are about 42 percent full now, or about half their average level for early February. New York City's reservoirs are in a similar state, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg issued a drought warning, with appeals for voluntary conservation, in late January. The dispute between the New Jersey utilities stems in part from a state water preservation edict issued on Jan. 24. The order lowered a state mandate requiring certain flow rates in streams and rivers throughout New Jersey. The order allowed the North Jersey commission to pump more water from the Pompton and Ramapo Rivers to its Wanaque Reservoir in West Milford, the biggest reservoir in northern New Jersey. The reservoir is only about 30 percent full now. The Passaic Valley commission contends that the increased pumping in the two rivers has removed too much of the water that normally would flow from them into the Passaic. The Passaic Valley utility is permitted to draw 75 million gallons of water a day from the Passaic River at its treatment plant in Totowa. In nondrought times, the state requires a flow rate of 17.6 million gallons a day at the Totowa plant after the withdrawal of the 75 million gallons. The state's water preservation order of Jan. 24 reduced the required flow rate to 13.6 million gallons a day. Joseph A. Bella, executive director of the Passaic Valley Water Commission, said today that the increased upstream pumping had left a flow rate at Totowa of only two to five million gallons a day in the last two weeks. Because of those flow rates, Mr. Bella said, the Passaic Valley commission is now treating lower-quality water than normal and facing higher water purification costs. He also said the low rates jeopardized his utility's legal right to take 75 million gallons a day from the river. ''This is the first time we've had this problem,'' he said. ''We've had low flows before but we've always been able to manage it between ourselves.'' After today's conferences with state officials, Phil White, a spokesman for the North Jersey commission, disputed Mr. Bella's contentions about overpumping and violations of state regulations. ''The water going their way is enough for their 75 million gallons, plus the 13.6 million gallon flow rate,'' he said. ''We're saying that's being done.''"
"Under a cloudy sky that seemed to mock the drying lake bed he used as a backdrop, the Bergen County executive, William P. Schuber, declared a drought emergency today, authorizing what officials said was the New York region's first mandatory restrictions on water use this year. Hours later, the acting Hudson County executive, Bernard M. Hartnett Jr., also declared a drought emergency, with some of the same restrictions, banning homeowners from washing cars and hosing down sidewalks, driveways and patios, and prohibiting restaurants from serving water unless requested. Mr. Hartnett also ordered the shutdown of decorative fountains that do not recycle their water. The declarations were made as the region and much of the Eastern Seaboard face one of the worst droughts in decades, with prospects for a particularly parched spring heightened by the lack of snow and ice this winter. The bans ratchet up the official responses of state and local officials to the drought. Until now they have issued only warnings or requests for voluntary conservation. In declaring today's emergencies, officials said the two counties' reservoirs were at roughly 50 percent of capacity, as opposed to the normal 80 percent for this time of year. Mr. Schuber issued his declaration on the banks of Woodcliff Lake, one of the reservoirs that supply Bergen County. ''Obviously, the lack of rain and snow are cause for concern as we move in to the spring, when water use normally increases,'' he said. Rachel Hamilton, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, said warnings had been issued in five of the state's six regions, and a less serious drought watch, mainly to raise public awareness, had been issued in the sixth. Under a warning, residents are asked to conserve through such steps as taking short showers, watering plants with leftover water and turning off the tap while brushing their teeth. Gov. James E. McGreevey has the option of declaring a statewide emergency, which would allow him to order coordination of water supplies among the state's water suppliers. But, Ms. Hamilton said, even a statewide drought emergency would not necessarily mean restrictions. Violators of the Bergen and Hudson County restrictions face fines of up to $5,000 and six months in jail, but warnings are far more likely, said Thomas Ammirato, a spokesman for Mr. Schuber. If the drought persists, Mr. Ammirato said, Bergen County could ban lawn watering and order commercial car washes to close."
"The mayor of New York City tends to be a person who likes to be in control, but that desire usually does not extend to aircraft. But Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has a pilot's license and an airplane or two at his disposal, took the controls of a New York City police helicopter last month to go to the inauguration of Adolfo Carrión Jr., the Bronx borough president. It was nice, he said, but really no big deal, given that he owns a better one. ''I fly helicopters more sophisticated than that all the time that I happen to own,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''And it was a good experience to show the men and women of that part of the Police Department that I know what they're doing and I care about it.'' ''And it was on official business of the city, where the only ways I would perform the duties'' was by getting around by helicopter, he added. In his autobiography, Mr. Bloomberg recounts an incident in 1976 in which he was forced to crash-land a rented Enstrom F-28 helicopter on a small island off Connecticut after losing power. The mayor's helicopter flight last month -- first reported by Newsday -- was in a Bell 412. Police officials said that Mr. Bloomberg flew the helicopter for less than a half-hour, during which he controlled neither the takeoff nor the landing. The officials said that the mayor's request to fly the police helicopter, while unusual, was not untoward. Nothing in the police patrol guide prevents it, said Michael P. O'Looney, deputy police commissioner for public information. ''Qualified civilians are occasionally allowed to test or operate police equipment,'' he said. Mayors and other officials over the years have from time to time operated official trains -- not planes -- and automobiles, with decidedly mixed results. In 1904, Mayor George B. McClellan took control of the first IRT subway train for its maiden trip and refused to give up the controls to a motorman, even after coming to a lurching stop that sent riders flying. In 1991, Peter E. Stangl's appointment as head of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was endangered when it was disclosed that he, his wife and two friends had ridden in the cab of a commuter train, with one of the friends at the controls for part of the ride. Mr. Bloomberg, who as in previous weeks deflected questions about where he spent his weekend, was visibly annoyed yesterday by his exchange with reporters during a news conference at the temporary headquarters of the Office of Emergency Management in Brooklyn. When a reporter from Newsday began to ask a question about his helicopter ride, Mr. Bloomberg cut her off, saying that there was ''always a theme with these questions'' and denouncing them as ''not substantive,'' before adding, ''but go ahead.'' Soon after, another reporter inquired about costly problems in the city's garbage collection program. The mayor snapped, ''You've identified the problem, and as soon as you come up with a solution I'd be happy to hear it.'' But he said that he would not reopen the Fresh Kills landfill. Another reporter, attempting to change the topic, inquired about the city's water supply; officials said yesterday that a drought emergency would be declared in New York City in the next four to 10 weeks if the dry weather continued. Rather than reiterate his earlier calls for New Yorkers to conserve water, Mr. Bloomberg said, ''Last time I looked out the window there's not a cloud in the sky,'' and concluded that the dry weather had made the drought situation ''worse, not better.'' The Office of Emergency Management has moved temporarily into a warehouse in Brooklyn near the Brooklyn Bridge until it is able to construct a new site deeper in Brooklyn. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's bunker for the agency was destroyed in the World Trade Center attack. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will reimburse the city for roughly $3.8 million of the costs of constructing the temporary center. It replaces Pier 92 on Manhattan's West Side, which the city agency began using shortly after Sept. 11."
"With soil parched, reservoirs depleted and streams trickling at rates typical of a record summer heat wave, water managers for New York City and surrounding communities are scurrying to find new ways to increase supplies and cut demand. It is not that they are worried about getting through the East Coast's current dry spell, which technically began in 1998 and -- like all droughts -- will end eventually. In fact, many water officials and experts say the tough droughts in the 1960's and 1980's prompted conservation measures that have cut profligate water use. The new effort is aimed at a point down the line -- no one knows how far in the future -- when spreading development reduces the soil's storage capacity, and the growing population and economy boost demand so much that some places run dry. For some communities, chronic water shortages could lead to a politician's ultimate nightmare -- an immovable cap on economic growth. ''It's going to be a tough, dry season,'' said Bradley M. Campbell, the acting commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. But more important than getting through this year, he said, is changing practices so the metropolitan region can handle future, potentially larger, climate shifts comfortably. ''We need to change the way we do business in managing water resources,'' he said. Government hydrologists say a prolonged lack of precipitation and warm temperatures this winter are setting the metropolitan region up for a summer drought that could rival what is called the ''drought of record,'' which drained reservoirs and wells from 1963 to 1965. New York City and most New Jersey counties have been under a drought warning since late January. The Delaware River Basin Commission, which controls Delaware River water used by 20 million people, issued a drought emergency in December that reduces allotments for New York City and the four states sharing the supply. In New Jersey, some private water suppliers have begun offering steep discounts to large users when water is plentiful, to encourage those that have storage capacity to fill up when water is abundant and cut water use. But much more must be done, said Mr. Campbell, whose agency is trying to get developers to change their approach to some projects -- to create parking lots with permeable material instead of asphalt, for example, allowing rain to percolate into the soil. The state also needs to clean up its galaxy of toxic waste sites, which continue to taint groundwater and keep that resource off limits for drinking, he said. Eventually, fundamental shifts in development patterns will probably be necessary, water policy experts in the region say. ''What comes first, the water supply or the housing?'' said Gary N. Paulachok, the deputy Delaware River master, who is charged with making sure the users of of the river's water are honoring binding agreements to share it. ''In a lot of cases,'' he said, ''we see housing developments go in and then the search is on for a water supply.'' To stave off trouble, New York City is taking a fresh look at a range of ideas even as its engineers inspect equipment it last used in the drought emergency of 1989 to pump and treat water from the Hudson River 60 miles north of the city -- the source of last resort. It is considering buying small private water supplies south of its Delaware River reservoirs in the Catskills, which could help it meet its obligations under an interstate water compact. The city has to keep some water flowing in dry times to other users of the Delaware River in New Jersey and elsewhere downstream. By gaining control of other water sources feeding into the Delaware, the city could satisfy its water-sharing requirement without taking as much from reservoirs holding the city's supply. City officials have also started asking big commercial users of water to consider switching, where possible, to recycled wastewater for nondrinking purposes instead of using high-quality drinking water. ''Ninety percent of the water we use does not go to human needs,'' said Charles G. Sturcken, chief of staff of New York City's Department of Environmental Protection. The city is interested in pursuing anything that cuts the use of drinking water for other purposes, he said. The goal, city officials said, would be to install systems for reusing water for such purposes, the way car washes and laundries capture, filter and reuse water that would otherwise go down the drain. One large consumer cited by Mr. Sturcken is the airports. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey guzzles tens of thousand of gallons of water a day to wash planes at the regional airports it operates. To keep jobs and businesses coming to Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island without straining drinking water supplies, Mr. Sturcken said, the city is considering drawing undrinkable groundwater from wells in Brooklyn and Queens to supply, at a discount rate, to businesses needing water for manufacturing. And in a layer of porous rock deep beneath the boroughs, the city is also considering creating a reservoir, a giant underground bubble of water stored in the porous earth. In times of surplus, water would be pumped into this layer of porous rock, then pumped out when supplies are low, city officials said. New Jersey already has nine such reservoirs, called aquifer storage and recovery systems, and five more are planned or are being built, said R. David G. Pyne, a water engineer in Gainesville, Fla., who keeps track of water storage projects around the world and maintains a Web site on the technology, www.asrforum.com. Subterranean banking of water is most established in dry regions. Las Vegas has the largest aquifer storage system in the United States, pumping up to 100 million gallons a day into the ground. New York City's would equal that, if tests bear out its merits, Mr. Sturcken said. Another result of the region's steadily lengthening drought, which water experts say almost guarantees strict limits on use this summer in the New York metropolitan area, is intensifying tugs of war over shared supplies. Most notable is the growing grumbling over how best to share the Delaware River, which provides about half of New York City's water through aqueducts leading from the Catskills and also serves 12 million people downstream, some as far as Philadelphia and parts of Delaware. City environmental officials say they have been pressing the Delaware River Basin Commission to fulfill commitments to build new reservoirs downstream. Under the existing sharing scheme among New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware, established after two battles before the United States Supreme Court, the city is obliged to dump water from its reservoirs to sustain a certain flow in the Delaware. Robert Tudor, the deputy executive director of the river basin commission, said that every option for averting shortages was being considered by communities sharing the water. In Pennsylvania, experts are assessing using old gravel pits and mines to bank excess water, he said. The Pennsylvania Legislature is also considering a bill that would create the first statewide system for conserving water and tracking all water use. The bill cites projections that parts of the state will run out of water in a few decades. Some private water experts say New York City would benefit greatly from adjusting prices for water to encourage conservation in dry times -- the same way transportation officials are now increasing tolls during periods of peak traffic to encourage people to shift driving patterns. James T. B. Tripp, a member of the New York City Water Board and general counsel for Environmental Defense, a private conservation group, said that raising rates a certain amount for each level of a drought warning or emergency would encourage landlords, homeowners and businesses to conserve. ''People respond to prices,'' he said. ''It's a great way to deliver a message.'' Even as water disputes intensify and conservation projects move ahead, no one is certain whether the future will be drier or wetter. Ever since the city, in the 1830's, put 4,000 laborers to work building distant dams and aquifers for its upstate supply, most decisions and investments made by the people who manage the water system and others nearby have been aimed at preventing problems a generation or more ahead. But now there are many indications that the climatic future will not resemble the past, that a global warming trend and other regional shifts measured in recent years hint of bigger, unpredictable, changes to come. Most climate experts expect global warming to have big impacts on water supplies around the world, altering storm and drought patterns, spawning more sudden downpours, and shrinking mountain snowpacks that provide long-term water storage for places like California and Afghanistan. But when the focus closes in on specific regions, the computer models render only a blurry vision. A recent study of the impact of climate change on water supplies in and around New York City by scientists at Columbia University said there would doubtless be changes. For example, the study said, warmer temperatures will result in more water loss through evaporation and will likely require the city to release more water into upstate streams in the summer to sustain native trout populations. But in a warmer world, would there generally be more or less water in the reservoirs? The scientists answered with a blunt maybe. ''Current global climate change models cannot forecast rainfall patterns with sufficient accuracy to indicate what will happen to precipitation in the New York City system watersheds,'' the report said. And that leaves the water managers for the city, New Jersey and communities small and large along the East Coast expressing growing concern as they log onto the Internet every day to check government maps of stream and river currents, where colored dots denote the strength of flows. For months, the region -- in fact the entire East Coast -- has been peppered with red dots, each indicating a new record low. The managers know chances are that spring rains will return, or a hurricane will sweep up the coast, or El Niño's slow awakening in the Pacific this year will nudge the jet stream and shake off the dry pattern. But even so, they say, the array of glowing red dots adds to the urgency of their search for ways to store, conserve or secure more water, because there is the chance that nature will not cooperate. ''Is it good water management policy to depend on tropical storms to get us out of trouble?'' said Mr. Paulachok, the Delaware River water official. Last year, such a storm never came, setting up the situation that is intensifying now. In the meantime, all around the region, the ground is growing drier and streams are continuing to shrivel, according to federal officials. ''In southeastern Pennsylvania, well drillers are working 24-7 to either drill new wells or deepen existing ones,'' Mr. Paulachok said. ''It could be a very, very difficult summer.''"
"Fearing an extended drought that could perilously lower water levels in New York's reservoirs this summer, the city is beginning to reopen and install filters in 10 to 25 closed wells in southeastern Queens. The well water would provide an additional 40 million gallons a day, Geoffrey C. Ryan, a spokesman for the city's Department of Environmental Protection, said yesterday. The water in each well will be tested before charcoal filters are installed, he said. The installation is expected to cost $6 million and take two to three months. The wells were bought by the city in 1996 from Jamaica Water Supply, a private company. Their levels were low at the time, Mr. Ryan said, and they were closed to let them recharge. Ten wells now operate in southeastern Queens, he said. The city plans to reopen 10 other wells that are thought to have water safe enough to drink without filtering, he said. Fifteen additional wells currently closed may contain contaminants that charcoal filters would remove, he said. But James F. Gennaro, chairman of the City Council's Committee on Environmental Protection, said some of the wells in question were contaminated. He said he was concerned that filters might not remove ''100 percent'' of any contaminants. Mr. Ryan said some of the wells being considered had ''aesthetic problems'' and might contain contaminants from dry-cleaning chemicals. But charcoal filters would remove all the contaminants, he said. The city's plans were announced as officials debated the proper response to a drought that has lasted for months throughout the East Coast, from Georgia to Maine. The drought, scientists agree, is one of the most severe and lengthy in decades. The city is now under a drought warning, which means that water levels are very low. Last month, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg urged New Yorkers to conserve water, and they responded by using 30 million fewer gallons per day compared with the average usage of 1.9 billion gallons, according to the Department of Environmental Protection. But a drought warning carries no mandatory curbs on water use. Joel A. Miele Sr., the environmental protection commissioner, told the City Council on Monday that he did not want to impose restrictions on New York for four to six more weeks. His spokesman said there was a good chance of heavy rain in the spring. ''There tends to be a lot of precipitation in the spring,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''If we have a rainy March and wet April and May, we won't need to declare a drought emergency.'' But Mr. Gennaro said he wanted the agency to impose emergency restrictions within two weeks unless there was significant rainfall. A drought emergency declaration, he said, would force New Yorkers to conserve more water. ''We're talking about opening contaminated wells,'' he said. ''If that's not an emergency move, I don't know what is. I want them to say publicly what they're already doing privately.'' Mr. Ryan acknowledged that the drought was serious but said that it had not reached the level of an emergency, defined as the likelihood that reservoirs will be drained without stringent curbs. ''People say, 'Oh, it's dry. Why aren't we in a drought emergency?' '' he said. ''Dryness occurs often. You start talking drought emergency before you need to and you're crying wolf.'' March, April and May, he said, are historically the wettest months of the year. Scientists say there is almost no chance of getting enough rain to fill the city's upstate reservoirs by June. But a rainy spring could mean the difference between a summer of careful water consumption and one of tightly enforced restrictions, brown lawns and wilted flowers. The well water will go to several neighborhoods in southeastern Queens, including Kew Gardens, Richmond Hill, Jamaica, Rosedale, Laurelton, Springfield Gardens and Cambria Heights."
"Through the dry, cold nights and almost balmy winter days, across snowless mountains and under desert-blue skies, a record-setting drought has settled over the New York region and much of the East Coast, raising fears of a spring and summer of water rationing, dying plants and mud flats where water and life once ran. Water experts who have pored over records for precedents for the current situation are using words like ''wild'' and ''scary.'' Not only is the Eastern Seaboard feeling the effects of a dry fall and winter, but those are just the latest dry seasons in a dry spell that began in 1998. Unlike most droughts, the current one stretches in an almost unbroken line from Georgia to Maine. In some Northeastern communities, officials are comparing the current drought with the ones that parched the area in the early 1980's and the mid-1960's, and others are going back to the Depression and the end of the 19th century for comparisons. Yet even those benchmarks are different: the droughts of the last several decades were summer droughts, while this time, the dry months have stretched into the heart of winter, when the groundwater supply, which begins to subside in the spring, would normally be replenished by snow and rain. ''Historically, when it was so bad, at least we had snow and ice in the wintertime,'' said Shing-Fu Hsueh, director of water resources for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. ''But this year winter came and nothing happened. It's like the dry years simply continued nonstop.'' Even above ground, the evidence of drought is everywhere. Last week, the water utility of Stamford, Conn., urged residents to reduce consumption by 15 percent. The Potomac River, around Washington, has been setting daily records for low water flow. A water emergency has been declared for the 15 eastern Pennsylvania counties along the Delaware River. Officials in Orange County, N.Y., say the drought is the worst there in 30 years, while New Jersey is reporting its driest January and February since 1895. ''I would characterize our current situation as something I don't believe we have ever experienced before, and apparently it is not getting any better,'' Dr. Hsueh said. ''It is scary.'' The East Coast is not the only part of the country watching the skies for rain or snow. The lingering effects of a multiyear drought are still affecting the Mountain States and Southern California. The Northwest and the Mississippi Valley, however, have received plenty of water. In the East, the drought so far has mostly meant inconveniences, like longer hikes to fishing holes. Here in western New Jersey today, Andy Henthorn and his son and daughter had to hike 200 yards over a crazed lake bottom to cast their fishing lines into what was left of Spruce Run Reservoir. Mr. Henthorn figured that the drought would have penned a whole reservoir's worth of fish into a pond nearly one-third the lake's normal size. But they still weren't biting. ''I guess the water's too cold,'' he said. Hydrologists know that the full effect of the drought will not be felt for five more weeks, when lawns, trees and crops begin to search for moisture in the dry earth. But botanists, wildlife experts and farmers are already taking sharp notice. ''Winter droughts are still droughts,'' said Douglas LeComte, a senior meteorologist at the Climate Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ''I tell people, you look out the window and you don't notice anything unusual, but if there is low soil moisture out there and we don't get any in the next few months, we'll be going into a planting season with a problem.'' That agency's Drought Severity Index shows conditions of moderate to severe drought up the Atlantic Coast, from the Florida line to the northern tip of Maine. Eastern Pennsylvania, the Hudson River Valley, all of Long Island and most of New England are in the severe drought category, meaning that one would be expected once in 10 years. New Jersey south of the Raritan River and a wide band covering most of inland and northern Maine are listed on the index as suffering extreme drought, expected only once in 20 years. And experts are concerned that the abundant bright, dry days of this winter, which seemed like such gifts to Northeastern residents, have already locked the region into a water deficit that cannot be made up. Kim Tripp, vice president for horticulture at the New York Botanical Garden, calculated that drought-stricken areas would have to get 15 inches of rain over the next six weeks to bring the levels of reservoirs and groundwater up to average. But 15 inches is a third of a normal year's entire rainfall, about 44 inches, meaning that a complete recovery is all but impossible. ''The timing is a problem,'' Ms. Tripp said. ''Spring growth is the time when there's a huge demand for water. It would take a miracle to make up the water deficit in six weeks.'' It is not just farmers who have grounds for worry. Drought has already been blamed for pine beetle infestations along the Atlantic Coast, and inadequate water in the soil will stunt the growth of shrubs and bushes. Mature trees can survive two or three years of drought without serious damage, said Stuart Findlay, an aquatic ecologist at the Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y. But smaller plantings will need substantial watering to thrive just as restrictions on watering lawns and washing cars are being introduced. Wildlife also suffers, said Michael Principe, deputy commissioner of the New York City Bureau of Water Supply. Lowered water levels in ponds and streams expose aquatic plants to freezing, and the loss of those plants, in turn, affects insect larvae and dragonfly nymphs that depend on them. ''Small fish feed on them, and larger fish on the smaller fish,'' Dr. Principe said. ''That's the whole food chain.'' Ralph Hoffman, vice president of the Ashokan-Pepacton chapter of Trout Unlimited, a nonprofit ecology group, said the fishing in New York State would probably be poor for several years. Even last spring, he said, streams were too shallow for rainbow trout to spawn. The situation was worse when the brown trout spawned last fall. ''This spring,'' he said, ''the water tables on the streams are very, very low. There'll be less trout for years to come.'' Wide swings in weather conditions, from drought to flooding, are part of the decades-long climate patterns linked to pollution from greenhouse gases, a contributor to global warming, said Janine Bloomfield, a senior scientist at Environmental Defense, a nonprofit group. But, she added, no single drought can be attributed to global warming. The absence of precedent for the current dry spell leaves water experts scratching their heads. ''We really don't have the kind of historical understanding, the historical record to predict what might happen,'' said Robert Lent, the Maine district chief for the water resources division of the United States Geological Survey. ''These are very unusual conditions.'' Last year was Maine's driest in the state's 107 years of record-keeping. A report last month from the state's drought task force, formed last summer, estimated that Maine needed 150 percent of its normal precipitation in the coming months to bring the state out of the drought. ''The chances of this happening are minimal,'' the report said."
"Pool owners up and down New Jersey's drought-stricken suburbs can relax. They can still fill their pools during a drought emergency, despite a widespread misapprehension that the state's new water rules prohibit that. It's just going to cost them a little more. All right, a lot more. The water restrictions imposed on Monday ban the use of garden hoses or the local volunteer fire department to fill existing public and private pools. But the regulations allow nonmunicipal water to be trucked in, and the state's pool builders' trade association is busy lining up companies in Pennsylvania and upstate New York who have good wells and clean tankers to put the blue shimmer back in their customers' yards. Still, Joel Caesar, director of the Northeast Spa and Pool Association here, said that at about $350 for an 8,000 gallon truckload, it would cost more than $1,000 to fill even a small, 24,000-gallon swimming pool. ''The cost of the water is not high,'' Mr. Caesar said, ''but transporting it is.'' Whatever the cost, the scramble is on to find haulers, he said. ''New Jersey is in a drought emergency, Rockland County is in a drought emergency, all 24 counties of eastern Pennsylvania are in emergencies, too, so trucking water in is not an easy thing,'' Mr. Caesar said. ''I just got a call from a member in Staten Island, which is not in a drought emergency, and his message was, 'Do you have anybody over there in New Jersey I can buy water from?' '' The Department of Environmental Protection has received ''many disgruntled calls'' from people confused by articles in local papers about pool owners worried that there will be no swimming this summer, said Elaine Makatura, a department spokeswoman. She said that using water other than municipal and drinking water was not prohibited. The department plans to issue clarifications of the restrictions. Pool owners now have a wide leeway to pour water into their pools. They may fill a newly built pool with trucked-in water before May 1, and with their municipal water after that date. They may drain and refill a pool from the municipal supply for repairs required ''to preserve the structural integrity of the pool.'' They may also top off a pool that has been partly drained for the winter, which is usually done to protect tile work around the waterline, and they may add water to keep the filtration system running correctly."
"Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg declared a drought emergency in New York City yesterday and ordered mandatory restrictions on water use by businesses and residents. It is the first drought emergency in the city since 1989. The lack of rainstorms during the hurricane season last fall and the unusually warm and dry winter have taken a severe toll on the water supply: the city's reservoirs, which are usually 92 percent full at this time of year, are at 50 percent levels. And officials said that the cold rain that sent many New Yorkers digging out their trench coats and galoshes yesterday was not enough to make a difference. Mr. Bloomberg ordered a series of water-saving measures to take effect on Monday. Businesses will be forced to cut their water consumption by 15 percent. Car washing will be prohibited, unless well water is used; so will hosing down sidewalks, driveways and streets. Ornamental fountains will be kept dry. And lawn watering will be allowed only a few hours every other day. ''The city's water supply is something that we absolutely have to protect,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''We will get through this period. We hope that nature is kind, and we get a lot of storms. The next 45 days are typically a rainy period, and that will help. But the reason for the declaration of a Stage 1 emergency is that the likelihood, even if we have a lot of rain, is that we will still have our reservoirs at a dangerously low level.'' New York City is hardly alone in its drought woes. The federal government has warned of severe to extreme drought conditions along the East Coast from Maine to Georgia. New Jersey ordered statewide restrictions on water use two weeks ago. New York State has declared drought warnings, which call for voluntary conservation measures, in 21 counties. And the city's drought emergency extends to Putnam, Westchester, Ulster and Orange Counties, because they use the city's water system. A severe dry spell has gripped the metropolitan region since the fall. The months from October to February were the driest on record in southeastern New York State and northern New Jersey, said Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Penn State University. The area received an average of 8.21 inches, he said, half of what it usually gets in that period. City officials said that as parched as the reservoirs were, they still held enough water to keep the city supplied for another 9 or 10 months. Mr. Bloomberg said that ''we're a long ways from ever turning the spout and not having something come out.'' But he said the city had to take steps now to conserve water. City officials said that they would step up enforcement of water regulations, which are punishable by fines of $100 to $1,000, with even higher penalties for repeat offenders. The mayor announced the drought emergency from a metal catwalk in a cavernous chamber some 25 stories below ground in the Bronx. He was in the city's valve chamber, one of the main distribution points in the water system, where millions of gallons of water from the city's upstate reservoirs flow through 34 eight-foot-wide valves each day and are routed into a labyrinth of tunnels and water mains and pipes that eventually carry the water to hot and cold faucets in all five boroughs. Mr. Bloomberg, trying to be heard above the rumble of the water passing through the pipes, praised the public, saying that people had been using less water since January, when he issued a drought warning. ''The public actually has done a very good job when we have publicized this, and there is no reason to think that they won't understand that this is a resource that has limitations and they'll just have to use less,'' the mayor said in the chamber. But even with consumption down from 30 million to 50 million gallons a day, officials said, the city still uses about 1.2 billion gallons a day. They said they hoped the mandatory restrictions would drive water use to below a billion gallons a day, further stretching out the city's supply. In addition to the restrictions on car and street washing, the drought emergency curtails lawn watering, which will be restricted to four hours a day, every other day. People who live at even-number addresses will be allowed to water their lawns on even-number dates, and people at odd-number addresses on odd-number dates, between 7:00 and 9:00 a.m. and 7:00 and 9:00 p.m. Other restrictions, some of which have been only sporadically enforced in recent years, will be in full effect. Waiters will be allowed to serve tap water in restaurants only if it is requested. Unrepaired leaks will be subject to fines. Officials will crack down on people who open fire hydrants without a permit. Joel A. Miele, the commissioner of the city's Department of Environmental Protection, said that people would be given warnings before they were fined. ''This is a kind and gentle administration,'' he said. ''People will get a warning the first time. And then the second time they will get a summons.'' Some environmentalists have said the city should have been quicker to impose water restrictions. Mr. Miele -- who is stepping down from his post next week to make room for Mr. Bloomberg's appointee, Christopher O. Ward -- said he was satisfied the city had declared an emergency at the proper time. If it does not rain, and the current restrictions do not save enough water, the city will move to more severe stages of a drought emergency, which would require businesses to cut their consumption by 20 percent, and then 25 percent. In the most severe situation, a Stage 3 emergency, the city could seek permission to pump some water from the Hudson River, purify it and use it in the water system."
"The bill came due today for New Jersey's warm, dry winter in the form of the nation's first statewide restrictions on water use, including a ban on watering lawns and washing cars. Warning that some areas are down to a 100 days' supply of water, the commissioner of environmental protection, Bradley M. Campbell, issued the ban for most of the state, as well as other restrictions on the commercial use of water. Gov. James E. McGreevey asked Mr. Campbell to draft the new rules as he declared a drought emergency last week. The rules are relatively mild, considering the dire warnings from state officials in recent weeks about the severity of the drought, and contain many exceptions to protect businesses and agriculture. Mr. Campbell acknowledged today that his powers to curb consumption were limited and said he might ask for legislation to broaden them. He also said that today's restrictions were needed to avoid more dire cutbacks. ''We have had the driest December, January and February on record, and we are headed toward the driest March on record,'' Mr. Campbell told a State Senate committee hearing at which he outlined the new rules. ''Reservoirs that at this time of year are typically at more than 80 percent are now at less than half that. In certain segments of our state -- certain of our drought regions -- if usage doesn't change and rainfall patterns don't change, we have 100 days' supply of water.'' Mr. Campbell said the state would need to get 10 inches of rain in the next five weeks to reach a ''comfort level'' in supply. In all of February, New Jersey got less than one inch. Normal statewide rainfall for February is three inches. Butch Kinerney, a spokesman for the United States Geological Survey, said that while most of the Eastern Seaboard was in a drought, no other state had resorted to statewide water-use restrictions. New York has placed several Hudson Valley counties on water diets, and cities and counties in the New York region have imposed their own water rules. Here in New Jersey, the restrictions will be felt most immediately by homeowners, but only in the form of brown lawns and shrubs, and perhaps dusty cars. Commercial users, like landscapers, golf course operators and farmers, will still be able to use water, though at restricted volumes or times. But the ban on watering residential lawns does not apply to a huge swath of the state, including all or parts of Monmouth, Ocean, Union, Middlesex and Somerset Counties. There, lawn watering will continue to be allowed on alternate days, with odd-numbered houses watering on odd days and even-numbered houses on the even. Today's rules very closely follow the last statewide restrictions in New Jersey, imposed in August 1999, when the state was a year into what proved to be an extended dry spell. As they did then, the restrictions start out being broad, but are narrowed by many exemptions. Indeed, the only blanket prohibition in the new rules is a ban on unasked-for glasses of water in restaurants. So car washing outside commercial car washes is not allowed, except for fire trucks, trucks that carry hazardous materials, or cars in dealers' lots that are going to the showroom or to buyers. Road, sidewalk and patio washing is generally prohibited, except by road builders and outdoor restaurants. Lawn watering is still allowed for new sod or newly seeded ground, and by commercial fertilizer applicators. Past restrictions have reduced water use by as much as 30 percent, Mr. Campbell said. But he said he did not have a specific goal for this year. Bergen County, in the dry and populous northeast, imposed its own water regulations, including a ban on unsolicited glasses of water in restaurants, on Feb. 12. County Executive William P. Schuber said through a spokesman that action by the state's new Democratic administration was overdue. ''We were ahead of the curve on this,'' said Thom Ammirato, Mr. Schuber's spokesman, ''and all we can say is, thank God the state has chosen to act.'' Jeff Tittel, executive director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, praised the action but said more needed to be done. ''All in all, I think they're moving in the right direction,'' he said, ''but it's more important to do long-range planning. One day the rain will come, but the failures of the past are still with us, and we need to change the way we manage water in New Jersey.'' Mr. Tittel wants the state to restrict sprawl, reducing the way paving and development block rainfall from seeping into aquifers. Mr. Campbell made the same point to the Senate Environment Committee, saying, ''We need to ensure that water resources are taken into account when making decisions that affect new growth and development.'' And Mr. Campbell urged the legislators to start weighing solutions to inadequate pumping and pipeline capacity for shifting water from places with an ample supply -- like Round Valley Reservoir in Hunterdon County -- to drier areas in the northeast. He noted that a badly needed pump beneath the George Washington Bridge, used to draw water from the Hudson, was vandalized some time ago and never repaired. And the pump and pipeline system at Round Valley can deliver only half the amount it should to the northeast. The state's drought-region boundaries and restrictions are explained at www.njdrought.org. A state question line has also been set up at 1-800-448-7379."
"All along the East Coast, drought has shriveled streams as never before. But tucked in the woods 70 miles north of New York City, a deep pool of clear water spills into a sparkling brook that runs downhill to the Hudson River. No matter how dry the weather, gauges measure a flow of four million to six million gallons a day. No one is thrilled, however. The sinkhole and half a dozen other springs and wet spots nearby are fed by leaks 600 feet underground in one of the most important water tunnels in the world, the 85-mile Delaware Aqueduct. This 57-year-old tunnel carries, on average, half of New York City's daily supply of a billion-plus gallons of water from reservoirs along the Delaware River where it rises in the Catskill Mountains. It also supplies this town and many others along its route to the city. At certain times of the year, the tunnel carries 90 percent of the water for the nine million people served by the sprawling 19-reservoir water system, which has long been considered an engineering marvel of the industrial era. When the tunnel is at full capacity, about 36 million gallons a day escape through uncharted breaks in the concrete and steel lining, engineers for the city say. That might not seem much in a billion-gallon-a-day system, but the leak equals the total daily water usage of Rochester. And with New York City and surrounding communities preparing to enact drought emergencies in coming weeks requiring strict water conservation, fixing the leak has taken on new urgency, even though city officials say that inspections and repairs could take several years. ''It's particularly true in a drought, but you hate to see that kind of water lost at any time, given what went into building that aqueduct and the reservoirs,'' said Diane Galusha, who chronicles the deaths of 79 workers during construction of the Delaware tunnel in her book ''Liquid Assets: A History of New York City's Water System'' (Purple Mountain Press, 1999). The leaks were first noted by city engineers and consultants in 1991. In 1995 and 1996, the leakage rate when the tunnel was running full bore was estimated at 25 million gallons to 34 million gallons a day, engineers reported. After 10 years of analysis and preparations -- a period environmental groups and some city elected officials say was far too long -- preparations for the repair effort are under way. The operation is is risky and elaborate, involving novel applications of technologies from deep-sea explorations and oil prospecting. There are roles for deep-sea divers, robots and pilots flying with heat-sensing cameras that can detect cold tunnel waters as they seep to the surface. This fall, a pilotless submarine will ply 45 miles of the tunnel looking for cracks. If the submarine works, it may be used by other cities, including Chicago, to inspect aging aqueducts. The effort to investigate the deeply buried leaks got under way in 1998, but gathered momentum in 2000, when officials agreed there was at least some risk of losing the tunnel entirely. The city began developing a contingency plan ''in case of tunnel failure,'' according to one city memo -- on the theory that the leakage might be weakening overlying rock sufficiently to collapse the 13-foot-diameter tunnel. This plan would include requiring upstate communities that tap 125 million gallons a day from the city system to shift to local sources; imposing sharp restrictions in the city; and temporarily using other supplies that are not as clean as the water from the distant Catskills. But recent engineering studies show no signs that such a calamity looms, said John M. McCarthy, a senior engineer at Malcolm Pirnie Inc., the engineering company hired by the city to conduct the investigation and supervise repairs. ''There is no evidence in all the investigative work we've done that the tunnel is in any imminent danger,'' Mr. McCarthy said. The first stages of the project are costing more than $27 million, not including fixing the leaks. The potential for problems was evident even in the years before World War II, as armies of ''sand hogs,'' the underground workers who specialize in tunnel digging, cut their way deep into the bedrock lying between New York's forested mountains and its concrete canyons. The Delaware branch of the three-pronged city water supply captures the water from the upper reaches of the Delaware River and stores it in four reservoirs west of the Hudson. At the Rondout Reservoir, the water plunges 1,000 feet and enters the 45-mile stretch of the tunnel that cuts east beneath scrubby ridges, fast-spreading exurbs and hillside apple orchards before it crosses far below the Hudson. On the east side of the river, the water rises through shafts and fills another reservoir before it flows south through more tunnels and basins to city taps. The system is a hydrological triumph, allowing most of the city -- even buildings up to 12 stories high -- to be supplied by gravity alone. But right from the start, geologists noted two spots where the landscape dipped along the initial 45-mile route, identifying weakened areas of faults and cracks deep below. One was in Wawarsing, a rural community east of the mountains, and the other on the northern edge of Newburgh, an old industrial town on the west bank of the Hudson. The most worrisome spot, by far, was the one on the riverbank. Two faults intersect there precisely where the tunnel diggers drove under the river. In the understated argot of engineering, reports cited the area's ''unfavorable geology.'' As the diggers proceeded, they had to inject cementlike grout into the rock ahead of them, trying to glue the fractured spots together before moving ahead with the excavation. To prevent leaks, engineers added heavy steel liners, nests of reinforcing steel bars and extra layers of concrete. The Delaware water began to flow in 1945 and all was well. In 1958, the last time the aqueduct was drained, inspectors drove the length of the tunnel in a modified jeep and found small leaks, but nothing significant. They did, however, notice some problems in the long stretch far beneath the Hudson. ''The concrete lining in this area which is directly under the Hudson River has numerous cracks in addition to those that are contributing to the inward leakage,'' the inspection report noted. By the 1990's, concerns were growing rapidly, but quietly. The city never publicly discussed the problem until the fall of 2000, when lawyers for Riverkeeper, a private environmental group, released documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. In the file were reports by Victor Feigelman, a longtime engineer for the city and later a consultant, who noted starting in 1991 that significant leakage had developed. The city ran tests introducing harmless dye into the tunnel and timing how long it took to surface in the Newburgh sinkhole. Consistently, it took the dye less than an hour to migrate from the tunnel up through 600 feet of rock to the pool. Even as the extent of the leaks became clear, the city identified a new problem. A shaft east of the Hudson, which is used in the rare instances when the tunnel is drained, had a leak somewhere in the bronze valve separating it from the tunnel deep underground. In December 2000, deep-sea divers began a repair operation that was as dangerous and hair-raising as a spacewalk. Far out of their usual element, they descended 70 stories into the 13-foot-wide shaft in a 12-foot-wide diving bell. Alternating teams spent nearly a week inspecting and finally repairing a half-inch hole where a metal plug had popped out of a fitting. More analysis led to a plan to use a self-propelled craft to inspect all 45 miles of the tunnel where the leaks are suspected. Oceanographic engineers are building a 400-pound mini-submersible, which they plan this fall to lower 1,000 feet into the vertical shaft leading to the tunnel's upstream end. The torpedo-shaped device, 9 feet long and 16 inches across, will be programmed to stay dead center in the tunnel and will use five digital cameras to record every foot of the lining as it heads downstream. After traversing the 45 miles, it will be plucked out through another shaft by a tethered submersible robot. It will also record subtle changes in sounds, in hopes that it may pick up the gushing, gurgling or trickling turbulence of escaping water, said Ben G. Allen, a senior engineer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Mass., which is building the $500,000 device. While the submersible inspects the tunnel from the inside, the city is preparing to inspect the rock around it from the outside, drilling a series of holes with the same precision equipment being employed in the Arctic to look for oil. The holes will be drilled to the depth of the tunnel, then turn horizontally in the spots where leaks are thought to occur, Mr. McCarthy said. ''They will parallel the tunnel for approximately 1,500 feet,'' he said, ''gathering hydrogeological data on how the water is moving, the rock quality and fractures.'' Along with the area near the sinkhole, water engineers are particularly concerned about the tunnel section that lies directly under the Hudson, where the solid rock above thins to about 300 feet and is overlaid by 200 feet of gravel and crumbled rock in the bottom of the culvert-shaped riverbed -- material left behind by the last ice age glacier. In a 1999 report for the city, Mr. Feigelman, the engineering consultant who first identified the Delaware leak a decade ago, wrote, ''The most severe scenario, of course, would be a significant leak under the river.'' It was statements like this that raised the concerns of Riverkeeper and other private groups. Marc A. Yaggi, a lawyer for Riverkeeper whose job is to monitor the city water supply for problems, still decries the pace of the repair effort. ''It's been 12 years they've been aware of it, and they've done virtually nothing except find out how much it's leaking,'' he said. ''They need to get started fixing it immediately. The downside is just too great to let this go on much longer without taking really aggressive measures.'' But city officials say they remain confident that the 8- to 14-foot-thick concrete walls and extra steel reinforcement in the tunnel's weak spots will hold firm until a repair plan can be drawn up. Joel A. Miele Sr., the commissioner of the city's Department of Environmental Protection, said it was important for New Yorkers to understand that the repairs were never intended as a short-term fix to help relieve current shortages. Given the extraordinary challenges posed by fixing something deep underground in a tube filled with high-pressure water, it pays to proceed cautiously, he said. When a deep tunnel is emptied of water, Mr. McCarthy noted, the change in pressure can create more risks of collapse than are posed by even a leak as large as that in the Delaware tunnel. Even so, officials are considering slowly emptying the tunnel and sending in work crews. Another option is building a specialized programmed submersible that could repair cracks autonomously without draining the tunnel, he said. Yet another would be to drill down from the surface around the leaking spots, again using the precision equipment, and to inject grout from the outside, Mr. McCarthy said. But this approach raises risks of blowouts similar to those that sometimes cripple oil rigs. A final possibility, he and city officials said, is that they will conclude that the risks of other repair strategies are too great and that the best choice may be to do nothing at all -- except perhaps eventually build a new tunnel to replace the old one. Mr. Miele, who leaves his position next month after six years, said he was confident that the city would come up with a repair and that the existing Delaware tunnel would last many more decades. ''As an engineer, it never cases to amaze me,'' he said of the tunnel and the water supply. ''It's the best expression of man's capability.'' But he did add that fixing the leaks could create new problems and said he had forewarned state environmental officials and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg about one, concerning the sinkhole in Newburgh. ''When we fix this leak, we're going to shut down that stream,'' Mr. Miele said. ''Those wetlands are going to dry up and that's probably against the law.''"
"Before long, a drought emergency will be declared for New Jersey. There is a good chance one will be declared later this year for parts of southern New York. What happens then, however, is still very much up in the air. Water emergencies were declared in New Jersey in August 1999, September 1995 and April 1985, each one lasting about six weeks. Water regulators confined themselves to fairly low-impact rules with the goal of reducing water use by 15 percent or so: golf courses could only water at night; private lawns could be watered only if the sod was new; fire departments could not open hydrants for training purposes; and so on. Facing a winter drought, and an onset of an emergency earlier in the year than at any time in modern memory, regulators are starting to worry that past experience may not be a good guide for what lies ahead. ''That's the big question,'' said Dr. Shing-Fu Hsueh, director of water resources at the state's Department of Environmental Protection. ''Will past practices be enough?'' Dr. Hsueh said the long-expected announcement of a drought emergency had been delayed as Gov. James E. McGreevey and the new environmental protection commissioner, Bradley M. Campbell, discussed toughening the largely piecemeal and voluntary restrictions of past droughts. In New York, Gov. George E. Pataki has created his first drought management task force to draw up the state's response to any water emergency. Connecticut, while not having any supply problems yet, has begun urging residents to conserve. Officials say they have one thing going for them: perhaps because letting lawns go brown and the car unwashed are fairly painless sacrifices, the public seems to embrace conservation fairly quickly once the word is spread, said Gerald R. Iwan, water supply chief for the Connecticut Department of Public Health. ''Our experience with droughts has been that when people are called upon to make sacrifices, they respond,'' Dr. Iwan said. New Jersey is in the worst shape of states in the region. It has only one major river, the Delaware. And because it consists mostly of coastal uplands and plains, it does not have the big snow reserves that New York has in its western counties and in the Adirondacks, or share in the water that flows from northern New England to Connecticut. So far, New Jersey officials have declared water warnings, the second level of alert, in five of the state's six regions. Only the central region -- with parts of Middlesex, Union, Somerset and Hunterdon Counties -- is in a less-serious drought watch. In New York, Governor Pataki has declared a drought watch, the first alert level, in 20 counties, and drought warnings in 26, covering all of New York City. At some point, New Jersey will reach the third stage: water emergency. ''There will be one, yes,'' Dr. Hsueh said. ''But I have no idea when.'' Without new guidelines from Mr. Campbell, New Jersey would have only the notes from past actions, which lean toward measures unlikely to inconvenience the public very much. In the past, for example, the state imposed a ban on filling swimming pools unless they were new, or had to be filled to maintain structural integrity, a claim state officials acknowledge is easy for almost any pool owner to make. There could be no spraying of sidewalks and patios, except at restaurants, where it could still be done for sanitary reasons. Golf courses and athletic fields could be watered only in the early morning or at night. While private lawns were off limits to sprinklers, trees, shrubs, vegetables and flower gardens could be watered if the hose was fitted with a nozzle. Richard G. Caton, executive director of the New Jersey Turfgrass Association, said severe water restrictions could put the smaller operations among his trade association's 700 lawn-care operators, nursery growers and commercial gardeners out of business. The organization's water supply arm, the Alliance for Water Conservation, has a lobbyist and an appointment with state officials next week to see that the growers' interests are represented in any discussion of water restrictions. Water rationing, done by adding a penalty on water bills for use over a specified volume of water, was tried in New Jersey in the 1960's, but such a step would be ''draconian,'' Dr. Iwan said. Instead, water regulators hope that public pressure will work as it has in the past. For example, United Water Resources, one of the biggest water utilities in New Jersey, reported that in the 1999 drought, mild restrictions and publicity about the emergency prompted customers to reduce water use from 143.5 million gallons a day on Aug. 1 to 98.2 million gallons by Aug. 8. However, that summer, New Jersey's major reservoirs were only 11.4 percent below full in August. As of Feb. 21, the reservoirs in New Jersey stood at 59.3 percent below full capacity."
"Gov. James E. McGreevey today issued his long-expected declaration of a drought emergency, intensifying the state's exhortations that the public save water and opening the door to mandatory water restrictions for a state that has been sliding into drought since 1998. Today's executive order authorized the environmental protection commissioner, Bradley M. Campbell, to develop mandatory water conservation measures, probably involving bans on watering lawns and plants or washing cars with garden hoses. The measures will be tailored to the needs of each of the state's six hydrologic regions. ''Water is a shared blessing and a shared resource,'' Governor McGreevey said in issuing the order, ''but it is also a shared responsibility.'' He directed Mr. Campbell to ''identify and impose'' water use restrictions according to conditions in each of the regions, and authorize penalties for water users who ignore the restrictions. Rainfall in New Jersey is at least 25 percent below normal for the last year in most counties, and as much as 50 percent below normal in the far northern and far southern counties. Statistics over the last 90 days, moreover, show how the drought is tightening its grip: rainfall is 25 to 50 percent below normal in all 21 counties. It is the evidence of a deepening drought in winter, a time when water supplies are normally replenished, that worries state water officials most. Mr. Campbell has not disclosed what mandatory measures he is considering. In the last water emergency, in the summer of 1999, the state banned the watering of residential lawns and private car washing, and restricted the watering of golf courses and athletic fields. The new emergency declaration is the earliest in the year in memory, however, and water officials have expressed the concern that the state's goal of achieving a 15 percent reduction in water use may require more drastic measures, like water rationing. That was last tried in 1966, by setting a volume limit on household use and imposing a price penalty for exceeding the limits."
"As the Northeastern drought intensifies -- warm dry days followed by cold dry days -- jurisdictions around the region have begun to make plans for an official drought emergency, with mandatory restrictions in water use, even as they fervently hope for wet weather. Except for the cold and the leafless trees, the region's streams and reservoirs have the look of a hot, dry summer about them, and it is still only the beginning of March. Even if rain appears this weekend, meteorologists believe that we will pull out of this drought slowly, too slowly to refill the reservoirs by early summer. Everyone hopes that spring, usually a very wet season, will bring normal rainfall. But nothing has been normal, weather-wise, in quite some time. A prolonged drought is a little like hard economic times, if only because it makes bad decisions and wasted opportunities so noticeable. Suddenly, the sources of water that are no longer available thanks to groundwater pollution or ill-considered development loom large in the overall water-supply picture. In a severe drought, they might have made a difference. The same is true for patterns of water use that wouldn't seem profligate in years of normal moisture but that suddenly seem extravagant now. These days, every drought is read against the background of global warming. There is as yet no incontrovertible evidence of a connection between the two; what we do know is that, as with global warming, we are not without answers if we are willing to face the problem. One, obviously, is conservation. After a drought warning was issued last month, New Yorkers cut the city's water consumption by 30 million gallons a day. Meanwhile, a sustained spring dousing, a few weeks of the soaking weather that makes everyone complain, would go a long way toward taking our minds off these worrying matters. It would certainly ease, for the moment, the worries of city planners, who have reopened wells in Queens and have been making contingency plans in the event of severe drought. But even if spring is wet and summer wetter, the long-range betting is on more dry times to come. Conservation should become a habit with us, conservation and a far more longsighted and imaginative use of an increasingly precious resource."
"Pointing to the current drought, a coalition of environmental and civic groups called on the federal government today to take a broader role in planning and financing land preservation in the New York-New Jersey Highlands, a swath of the Appalachians that provides drinking water for 11 million people in the metropolitan region. The group, the Highlands Coalition, made its appeal at the same time the United States Forest Service is finishing a new study of development and conservation tactics in the 1.5 million acres of forests, valleys and farmlands that stretch from the Delaware River in Hunterdon County to the New York-Connecticut border in northern Westchester County. In a 1992 study, the Forest Service had called the Highlands ''a landscape of national significance'' and outlined some conservation steps state and local governments could take to protect it. The coalition's chairman, Tom Gilbert, and other speakers at a news conference in the dining hall of an old Boy Scout camp here contended that the earlier study did little to discourage development and said they hoped the new report would be tougher. They said the region's drought underscored the need to protect the drinking water provided by the reservoirs, rivers and streams of the Highlands from overdevelopment. Mr. Gilbert said the coalition -- which includes the Sierra Club, the Audubon Society and the League of Women Voters -- has proposed saving 180,000 acres in the two states at a cost of $750 million, while Congress has provided only $7 million this year to save 25,000 acres. ''We need a broader federal-state partnership,'' Mr. Gilbert said. ''The Federal government must come to the table as a full partner. Not enough has been done by the federal government since the last report. We can't just have another report here and have business as usual continue.'' The Bergen County executive, William Schuber, called for a curb on development in the Highlands and for the creation of a master plan for the entire tract. ''We need federal help,'' said Mr. Schuber, a Republican who oversaw the county's recent purchase of the Scout camp's 750 acres for $5.1 million from county and private sources. ''We need a plan that treats this last great expanse of forested land as the vitally important water basket it is.'' In response, Marcus G. Phelps, the Forest Service coordinator for the Highlands, said that Congress is the only federal body that can provide preservation money for the Highlands. The new study, Mr. Phelps said, will identify tens of thousands of Highlands acreage that is valuable as a regional watershed, wildlife habitat and recreational sites and will propose management techniques that local government can use to protect that land."
"IN early spring, the 17 greenhouses at Matterhorn Nursery are always crammed with plants. In a good year, Matterhorn will sell as many as 1.5 million trees, shrubs, annuals and perennials. But this year, even though winter-weary gardeners are itching to get their fingers into the earth, sales of impatiens and waterlilies may be a little slower than usual. Rockland County is experiencing the worst water shortage in recorded history, according to Daniel Miller, a county geologist. The county has received 16 fewer inches of rain than is normal for this time of year. Its reservoir is less than half full. And earlier this month, the Rockland County Health Department barred residents from watering lawns and using sprinklers. Gardeners can now water only with a hand-held hose, a drip hose or a drip irrigation system. Nurseries like the Matterhorn can water only between 4 and 6 a.m. and between 7 and 9 p.m. That may sound like a lot to someone with a vegetable patch and a few flower beds, but to Matt and Ronnie Horn, who started Matterhorn 22 years ago, the restrictions could spell disaster. ''First of all, those aren't the times we water,'' Mr. Horn said. ''And when I have all my plants out -- mostly containers that dry out quickly -- we water 24 hours a day. By the time we finish watering all the zones, we start up again, because the first ones are dry already.'' And this is only what Rockland County calls a ''Stage 3 Drought Warning.'' If it doesn't rain substantially this spring, the county could declare its first Stage 4 Drought Emergency. This would impose severe restrictions on residents and the plant industry alike. Under Stage 4, flower and vegetable gardens, trees and shrubs cannot be watered at all. Golf courses cannot be watered. Private pools cannot be filled or even used. Water for plants cannot be taken from any source, not even a stream, not even a private well. Car washes, which can use recycled water now, would not be able to operate. And nurseries would not be allowed to water plants, period. ''We will review the situation again in May,'' said Scott McKane, an engineer with the Health Department. ''We are very aware of the economic impact of calling Stage 4.'' A nurseryman like Mr. Horn is not about to counsel customers not to plant. But it is a grim spring when he cannot turn on the 20 fountains in his 38 acres of demonstration gardens or fill the water gardens that display $300 koi, Perry's Sunburst lotus and waterlilies. Customers will certainly pause before buying a $3,000 beech tree that they may not be able to water. ''All my plant orders are on hold,'' Mr. Horn said. ''I still have 100,000 plants in stock, but we are ordering in dribs and drabs on an as-needed basis.'' Meanwhile, gardeners all over the state are asking whether to plant anything this year. Bob and Carol McKenna of Tappan, who have been buying plants from Matterhorn for more than a decade, are playing it safe. ''We are at a period of watchful waiting, but it sure doesn't look good,'' Mr. McKenna said. ''We lost some holly last year, because the roots hadn't gotten established,'' Mrs. McKenna said. ''I usually put in 100 impatiens, but you need a sprinkler to keep them going. So maybe I'll just do some planters this year, to get that splash of color.'' Some horticulturalists are suggesting moderation. ''Home gardeners might want to limit their purchase of new trees and shrubs to only a few individuals, and if planning the installation of a whole landscape, to hold off until more normal precipitation occurs,'' said Donald Rakow, the director of Cornell Plantations, Cornell University's arboretum and extensive gardens in Ithaca. Nina Bassuk, the director of the Urban Horticulture Institute at Cornell, was more optimistic. ''The fact that the reservoirs are down doesn't mean that we don't have enough soil moisture for early leafing out,'' she said. ''If we get rain in May and June, when trees are really putting on growth, they should be fine.'' The specter of an all-out ban kindles rage in some horticultural quarters. ''How do you tell a homeowner who has invested $10,000 to $100,000 in a landscape that they can't water their plants?'' Mr. Horn asked. Mr. Horn, who is providing all 30,000 plants for Macy's Flower Show, which gets under way on March 24, led the way through demonstration gardens, including beds of ornamental grasses that never need watering, and something that does, his latest, most ambitious project -- a three-acre rose garden built with David Austin Roses of Albrighton, England, to showcase 3,000 roses and perennials. If no rain falls, and drought emergency restrictions are put in place, the roses could die. ''We try to put a positive spin on things, like encourage drip irrigation, mulching and drought-tolerant plants, but I can't believe these laws,'' said Mr. Horn, who translates the restrictions as ''Let's kill all the plants and let everyone else use the water.'' By everyone else he means industries other than nurseries that use water, as well as malls and restaurants, car washes and hair salons. ''At least the water we use goes back to the aquifer,'' he said. Mr. Horn has never tried to measure the nursery's use of water, which is drawn from nine wells that he has dug over the years. Under a drought emergency, he would be prohibited from using them. The Horns intend to travel to Albany in the next two weeks with their lawyer to plead their case before legislators. Drought-emergency restrictions could harm the nursery industry, which is worth $6 billion a year in New York State, according to the New York State Nursery/Landscape Association, and $38 billion nationwide, according to the National Gardening Association. (The Matterhorn nursery employs 60 to 80 people in its busy season.) Mr. Horn, 43, grew up in nearby New City when Rockland County had 17,360 acres of farmland. Now it has 250 acres. ''But you can't keep adding people and think water conservation is the answer,'' he said. The answer, he said, lies in long-range plans: setting limits on development; legalizing the use of gray water from bathtubs, laundries and showers for nurseries and gardens; diverting storm water runoff; and building desalination plants. ''I'd like to see a five-year water plan,'' he said. Right now, conservation measures like diverting gray water in plumbing systems are illegal in New York and most other states. ''New York City uses 1.2 billion gallons of water a day, and four-fifths of that becomes gray water,'' said Paul Mankiewicz, a biologist at the Gaia Institute, an environmental consulting group in the Bronx. ''That is equivalent to nearly a quarter of an inch of rain a day,'' he said. ''If we used it, the city could look like the Gardens of Babylon.'' Meanwhile, expect to see a lot of container gardens this year, and brown lawns. Impatiens? Cactus Might Be Better SHORT of doing a rain dance, there are a number of ways to save your landscape this summer. STRATEGIES: Allow the grass to grow high, about three inches. If there are drought restrictions, be tactical with the water you have. Let the lawn go brown. Water valuable trees and shrubs first, then perennials, and annuals last. If you can't live without a vegetable garden, reduce its size. Add compost to increase the soil's water-holding capacity, and mulch the beds two to three inches deep to reduce evaporation. Or plant tomatoes and herbs in pots, and share your bath water with them. The excellent ''WaterSaver's Guide to Landscaping and Gardening'' by the Water-Wise Council of New York ($18) is available from Cornell Cooperative Extension of Rockland County, P.O. Box 1000, Thiells, N.Y. 10984. EQUIPMENT: Try tree-hugging bags from Treegator. The 20-gallon bags ($24.95 apiece), which zip around the tree, are filled from the top and trickle water to the root ball. They are available in garden shops or from www.treegator .com. Polymer crystals, like Soil Moist, will make soil 10 times more absorbent. But don't use too much, advised Matt Horn of Matterhorn Nursery, or the crystals ''will float the plant right out of its hole.'' One pound is about $15 at garden stores. Consider an underground drip irrigation system, like Netafim, a highly efficient system designed in Israel for desert gardening (www.netafim.com). PLANTS: Buy drought-tolerant trees like Japanese pagoda, Kentucky coffee, honey locust and Eastern red cedar; ornamental grasses like broom sedge, fountain grass, little bluestem and blue oat grass; ground covers like sedum, thyme, juniper, epimedium or bearberry; deciduous shrubs like sumac and Rosa rugosa; and perennials like coneflower, butterfly weed and goldenrod.

"Mike Sterling, an accountant from Staten Island, very much enjoyed his lunchtime stroll through Midtown Manhattan on a late winter's day last week when the temperature was drifting languidly past 60 degrees. Lovely, he said. Beautiful. ''But I'm sure we'll have to pay for it somewhere down the line,'' he said. Mr. Sterling's sentiment captures some of civilization's -- not to mention the accounting trade's -- oldest and biggest discontents: there is no free lunch; anything that feels good will have its comeuppance; beware of easy credit. Winter never really came to New York this year. So was that good, or bad? The lack of rain and snow made the living easy, but it delivered the region onto the threshold of a severe drought. Climate scientists say that the cumulative strangeness of the season -- the warmest and second-driest winter ever recorded in New York City through March 1 -- advanced their case that climate change, caused by the buildup of industrial-era gases in the atmosphere, is real and is happening now. But they fret that people might in fact grow to like the idea of climate change, having breezed through a winter like this one. Even some people who have dedicated their professional lives to the reduction of these so-called greenhouse gases quietly admit that they enjoyed the winter. ''It's very seductive,'' said Dr. Eric Chivian, a psychiatrist and director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School. ''I feel it in myself, especially as I get older. I love a balmy early-spring day in February.'' For most of human history, it didn't much matter what people felt about the weather -- they simply had to deal with what it brought them. But now it does matter, scientists say. How people relate to climatic events and unusual seasons has become part of the global dynamic of environmentalism, because perception and feeling can translate into politics. And by those lights, much of the Eastern United States has become a giant psychology experiment. For people like Dr. Chivian, enjoying the winter became almost a guilty pleasure. For many others, it was a complicated one. Psychiatrists say, for example, that the number of cases of wintertime depression -- known as seasonal affective disorder -- caused by light deprivation from short, gloomy days spent indoors -- was down sharply this year because of the abundance of sun and fine weather in which to enjoy it. But in the aftermath of September's terrorist attack, they say, new depression cases more than made up the difference. Climate researchers like Dr. Chivian say that the unusual weather and drought gave them added credibility. Politicians and business leaders returned their phone calls. But the cost of that was the feeling, to their immense dread, that they'd actually been proven right. Dr. Cynthia Rosenzweig, a senior research scientist at Columbia University's Earth Institute and co-leader of a multiyear study into the effects of climate change on the New York City region, stepped out into the yard of her home in Tarrytown, N.Y., last month, for example, and found that her quince tree had blossomed two months early. She loves her quince tree and its dark-pink blossoms. But the time was wrong. The quince tree was out of sync. ''We didn't really want this to be coming true,'' she said. What complicates the winter-that-never-was, making it more than simply nice or not, is that it was both a startling weather event in its own right and a cause of future disruption at the same time. The very hot summer of 1999, by contrast, also broke weather records, but it was, in a way, self-contained in that it did not leave lasting imprints on the seasons that followed. This winter was not like that. By its very dry balmy beauty it altered the future by not adequately filling the reservoirs that supply the region's water. It forced people, or at least politicians, to think beyond the immediate season. And that, in turn, scientists say, is what starts to connect the dots between day-to-day weather and the broader question of climate, and then beyond that to things like changing habitats and endangered species. A recent report by Dr. Rosenzweig's group at Columbia said, for example, that New York's climate in the middle of the 21st century might be drier, with more frequent droughts, or that it might be wetter, with more rainfall, but that in any case traditional seasonal cues and rhythms would likely be the first casualty. William Solecki, a professor of geography at Montclair State University in New Jersey and co-leader of the regional climate-assessment project with Dr. Rosenzweig, said that an absence of winter heightened for him the strangeness of life after the terrorist attack. ''Sept. 11, if you remember, was a crystal-clear-blue, dry day, and now the whole season has been like that over and over again. It's like being stuck in a time warp -- time isn't moving forward the way it normally does.'' For other people, it's that very sense of altered time since the attacks that made a beautiful winter even more precious. Mr. Sterling, the accountant who works in Midtown, said the heightened sense of uncertainty about life and the future made it imperative to him to seize each day as it comes. ''You have to enjoy life wherever you can,'' he said. Climate scientists see a dark cloud behind that kind of reaction to the weather, too. Dr. Chivian at Harvard said that on one level, he thinks the reassessments that people like Mr. Sterling have made about priorities and values are generally positive. But in thinking about human responsibility for future generations and ecosystems, the spirit of living for today can lead to a sense of acceptance and passivity, Dr. Chivian said, and that could have disastrous consequences. ''It illustrates a kind of helplessness, that there's nothing we can do about this, the best we can do is count our blessings and enjoy life as it comes,'' he said. ''Yes, it's nice to enjoy every day, but these are things we can control, and that we've got to control, or people coming after us will say we squandered an opportunity.'' Other researchers say that the ethos of American life, hammered into people's heads by credit card companies, carmakers and fast-food sellers, is to buy now, consume now, live now, and whatever you do don't put off the gratification. Asking people to think beyond the current season, indeed to generations beyond the current season, runs counter to those very powerful forces. Even asking people whether a pleasant winter alters their thinking about climate makes some scientists uncomfortable. A changed climate will in fact have winners and losers, those scientists say, and New York, in some ways, might well benefit. But to think only of the parochial consequences is exactly the sort of self-centered short-term thinking, they say, that created the problem, especially from the burning of fossil fuels in cars and electric power generators. ''As we're enjoying consumer society, most of us don't think about the negative consequences of having too much enjoyment in life,'' said Dr. Dan A. Oren, an associate professor of psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine. ''I suspect that the average citizen, including you and me most of the time,'' he said, does not feel ''the guilt that ought to be there.'' Somewhere in the middle of all that, real life went on in New York this winter, and people like Cynthia Ruiz were able to hold two very conflicting ideas in their heads. ''It's beautiful. It's scary,'' said Ms. Ruiz, a member-services representative for a labor union, who was taking her lunch hour in Bryant Park on Thursday, when the temperature reached 65. ''I worry about the global warming thing. The drought, yeah, too. Other than that, it's great.''"
"Up and down the East Coast, scientific evidence is revealing the extent and severity of what could be the deepest drought of the past 100 years. Forest fires in Maine, usually snuffed by snow, burn to the ground. The Potomac River has dipped to historic lows. New England is experiencing one of its driest winters since records started being kept. The United States Drought Monitor, a joint project of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and various academic partners, has classified the entire coast from Georgia to Maine as in ''severe'' or ''extreme'' drought conditions. A good spring rain will not solve this problem. Hints that the East would be unusually dry began appearing many months ago in rainfall and streamflow reports. Yet water managers and policymakers failed to move quickly enough to conserve water and improve water efficiency. Even now, efforts to prepare the public for the drought have mostly been limited to warnings and calls for voluntary restraint. And the East Coast is not alone -- central North America, from Mexico across the Great Plains and into the Canadian prairies, is experiencing droughts. Tensions have been growing since 1998 between Texas and Mexico over low flows in the Rio Grande. Farmers in southern Oregon went to battle with the government and the environmental community last summer over water shortages in the Klamath River basin. Droughts are a natural part of our climate system. They occur in different regions every year in the United States, costing us an average of $6 billion, principally from lost agricultural production, reduced hydropower generation and the effects of forest fires. California suffered a six-year drought from 1987 to 1992, causing widespread harm to ecosystems. The Dust Bowl in the 1930's eventually affected three-quarters of the nation and led to mass movements of refugees. We know how to reduce the effect of droughts. But we rarely act before conditions deteriorate to a crisis. As John Steinbeck wrote in ''East of Eden'': ''And it never failed that during the dry years the people forgot about the rich years, and during the wet years they lost all memory of the dry years. It was always that way.'' We can no longer afford to forget about the dry years. We must begin to reduce our wasteful use of water. There are two choices: become more efficient and productive in our water use or cut back on things we want to do. We know how to use water more productively. Water-efficiency efforts in California, Israel and New York City have shown that a combination of education programs and voluntary limits can quickly reduce short-term needs for water by 10 percent or even 20 percent. But experience also shows that responding to severe droughts with voluntary efforts alone is not enough. In the longer term, there must be actions at both the local and federal levels. Permanent reductions in demand will have to come from local pricing policies that encourage more productive use of limited water resources, new federal standards for more efficient technologies and the elimination of subsidies that promote waste. For example, new types of washing machines, toilets and garden irrigation systems can permanently reduce the amount of water we use in our homes by 30 percent or more. Reducing federal subsidies for low-valued, high-water-using crops can encourage farmers to shift to more water-efficient crops and irrigation methods. There is more bad news. The evidence is growing that this year's drought could be merely a taste of the future. Last week, the NOAA released evidence showing that the past three months were the warmest on record for the entire United States. For the planet as a whole, January 2002 was warmer than any January in 123 years. A report prepared for President Bush and Congress last year found that extremes of weather created by global warming could have severe consequences for the nation's water resources. We are already seeing strong evidence that humans are influencing the climate. In addition to rising temperatures, rainfall and snowmelt patterns are changing, glaciers are receding, and the flows of our rivers and streams are being altered. Is the current drought also a result of climate change? We don't know for sure. But we do know that unless effective policies are put in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which now seems unlikely, climate change will be unavoidable. We have no choice now but to try to anticipate and minimize the consequences. Let's treat the current drought as a dry run for what may become an even drier one. Peter H. Gleick, author of ''The World's Water,'' directs the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment and Security."
"HERE'S the way most people landscape: They plant a locust tree in the front yard when they move in, they put in a bed of roses at some point, and if they are really ambitious, they add a vegetable garden, foundation plantings or a grape arbor. Over the years they may waste money on cute shrubs that grow into giants that block the window, or on planting a privet hedge where the driveway should be. Winter is a natural time to reflect on such disasters of years past -- especially when freakishly warm temperatures like the ones we've been having turn thoughts so soon to springtime planting -- and to start planning a garden that matures according to a long-range plan. This year, it might be wise to consider employing the supporting cast that can make all the time and effort worthwhile. For gardeners who order exotic plants, only to have them turn to brittle sticks in a hard freeze, it's a good idea to ''gawk globally, shop locally.'' Going to a local nursery can improve the chances of getting plants that do well in your area. Instead of buying something propagated in California, for example, customers at Cristina Spindler's Peconic River Herb Farm and Specialty Plant Nursery in Calverton, N.Y., can see things that have been tested on the East End of Long Island. Homeowners can benefit from an army of helpers. Instead of soldiering on alone, or even with the help of a good local nursery, a smart gardener will enlist experts who can, in the end, help save money. ''Had my mother and father known they were going to throw away a couple thousand dollars every year for 20 years and have nothing to show for it, they might have hired a landscape architect,'' said Douglas Reed, a Boston-based landscape architect. Beyond landscape architects, homeowners can rely on arborists to remove that scraggly, half-dead maple, irrigation specialists to end the need to drag garden hoses back and forth across the lawn and masons to turn a muddy piece of lawn into their own little corner of the Piazza San Marco. Landscape Architecture The landscape architect is the general of your army of helpers, a professional who will examine things like drainage, soil types, light conditions, access and the way people move about the property. This helper is an engineer, an architect, a plant expert, a sociologist and an artist rolled into one. A landscape architect will consider where you walk, the routes you take in leaving the house, where you park the car. A serene corner with a well-framed view is important, as is a terrace where you can sip coffee and watch the birds. If you have children, a play area is important, too, but that doesn't have to mean a swing set and a jungle gym. Mr. Reed, whose designs range from little roof gardens and terraces up to 100-acre estates, is a principal of Reed Hilderbrand Associates in Watertown, Mass. ''All of us can think back to some nook or cranny of the backyard where we learned the most,'' he said. ''It's about stimulating the imagination of the child.'' That can mean a rock garden, a goldfish pond or a small grove. And, he said, ''more people are asking for a little kitchen garden for herbs and a few vegetables.'' Moreover, ''the more sterile character of the suburban lot is being challenged and reconfigured,'' he said. Travel has made people more sophisticated. They see naturalistic pools that flow into canals, cistern fountains that collect rainwater, fiber-optic lighting that alters the colors of a pool at night. Or they see tennis courts that can accommodate in-line skating and basketball. Or prairie grasses instead of a mowed lawn. Then they want to try them at home. The shape of the ground determines everything. ''Human activity requires level ground, and you rarely get a level site handed to you,'' Mr. Reed said. That means a budget for the ancient arts of earthmoving, terracing and wall building. Landscape architects generally charge $75 to $150 an hour. The American Society of Landscape Architects suggests investing 10 percent of your property's value in the landscape. The right improvements can return up to twice their cost when a house is sold. A word about nomenclature. Anyone with a lawn mower and a pickup truck can claim to be a garden designer. A landscape architect, registered or not, should be trained to look comprehensively at the site. Do some homework before hiring. The landscape architects' society can provide a list of people specializing in residential design at (202) 898-2444 or www.asla.org. Tree Care A large tree is like a magnificent horse in the front yard: you can't always tend it by yourself. And it might be illegal to prune a street tree without permission. ''Very often, the parks department says, 'Yes, if the work is done by a professional,' '' said Bruce McInnes, whose one-man company, Tree Care Consultancy of New York, in Brooklyn, concentrates on the city's five boroughs. Mr. McInnes works as a consultant, charging $160 to $180 a visit. He suggests people to do the work he considers necessary. If you are planning construction, a tree consultant can help avoid damage to tree roots or canopies. Mr. McInnes also says that living with a bit of insect damage is far better for the tree than dosing it with pesticides, which can leave wounds. What kind of job requires an arborist? ''Any job that requires anybody to get off the ground,'' Mr. McInnes said. It's all right to stand on a stepladder and prune a branch off the dogwood, but ''climbing around a tree with a chain saw is asking for trouble,'' he said. And don't assume that the person who mows the lawn and lops off your hedge can prune or plant your trees. That is best left to an arborist or the nursery that sold the tree. The International Society of Arboriculture in Champaign, Ill., (217) 355-9411, has a voluntary certification process for arborists, and the New York State Arborists' Association, in Latham, N.Y., (518) 453-6461, has a list of arborists. Irrigation Though some people find watering by hand relaxing, it is next to impossible to cover an extensive garden this way -- unless you don't have to go to work every day. With the current drought conditions, watering is even more important, though it can be restricted by the authorities. That makes it especially wise to hire an irrigation specialist. Large landscapes require separate zones, with sprinklers or drip lines. Zones may be necessary even in small gardens. Declan Keane's company, Estelle Irrigation in Manhattan, installs systems for private houses, apartment buildings and small parks. More plants die from overwatering than under, he said, so it's crucial to set up the zones correctly. And it's wise to call in an irrigation expert before you begin construction, so water and electrical lines won't interfere with each other. ''Even if someone is just building a patio,'' he said, ''it can help a lot to run the pipes underneath.'' Installing an irrigation system can cost as little as $1,000, or far more. Mr. Keane, who has an agricultural science degree from University College Dublin, sometimes finds that he has to do little more than assess water pressure. In New York, he said, ''it varies quite a bit,'' and can require correction with a booster pump. Ground-moisture sensors, which cut down on water waste, are constantly improving. During droughts, county and municipal water regulatory boards should be asked what water restrictions they have issued. One way to find a reliable irrigation installer is through a reputable nursery or botanical garden, or a horticultural society like Metro Hort, an association of horticulture professionals in the New York City area, at (212) 799-1276. The Irrigation Association, a trade group in Falls Church, Va., with 2,000 members, can provide a list of practitioners who have completed its certification program; (703) 536-7080. Masonry It takes a skilled mason to build a stone or brick wall, terrace or steps. ''We might do a free-standing dry-stone wall in an old potato field in Sagaponack, to give a sense of depth and perception to that nice, flat plain,'' said Tom Ciccariello, who started Seven Sons in East Hampton, N.Y., 20 years ago. ''A hilly area like Sag Harbor might require a lot of terracing and retaining walls.'' Stone can connect parts of the landscape, but an improperly constructed patio (one with the wrong grade, or one that cracks) can cause water damage to the house. A trained mason will also have a sense of aesthetics -- ''a nice flow to the stone, a sense of orderliness to the wall,'' as Mr. Ciccariello put it. Such masons can often be found through landscape architects or contractors. It's best to ask for a few names, interview the masons, see their work and talk to their clients. A registry of dry-stone masons is kept by the Dry Stone Conservancy, 1065 Dove Run Road, Suite 6, Lexington, Ky. 40502; www.drystoneusa.org or (859) 266-4807. HUMAN NATURE"
"The warm, dry winter has left the reservoirs that supply water to New York City only half as full as they usually are at this time of year, prompting Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to call yesterday for a series of voluntary measures to cut water consumption. The upstate reservoirs that supply the city are at only 41.5 percent of their capacity, city officials said. The normal level for this time of year is 80.5 percent. Mr. Bloomberg said the city would soon issue its first drought warning since 1995, an indication that its reservoirs may not fill up by June, when they are supposed to. ''There are not a lot of storms on their way, as far as we can tell, so this is a problem that is going to get worse,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference on the lawn of Gracie Mansion, on the banks of the East River. ''The question is, what can we do about it? And conservation is the answer.'' The mayor ticked off a host of recommendations for saving water, from fixing leaky faucets to running dishwashers only when they are full to cutting shower times in half. (''Get in, turn it on, get it to the right temperature, lather up, get rid of the soap and get out,'' was his prescription for ablutions.) New York City is hardly alone in its water woes. Twenty of New Jersey's 21 counties are under drought warnings. Drought warnings are also in effect in 21 counties in New York State, including Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan and Dutchess. The city's watershed area got about 11 inches less rain in 2001 than it usually gets, officials said. ''Basically, what we have here is a failure of nature to cooperate,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. The unusually warm weather has compounded the problem, said Joel A. Miele Sr., the commissioner of the city's Department of Environmental Protection. Mr. Miele explained that winter rains usually fall onto frozen ground and quickly run off into the reservoirs, but the ground has been so warm this winter that much of the rain that falls is absorbed before it reaches the reservoirs. The city's reservoirs were further drained last summer when the reservoirs in its Delaware system -- which, along with the Catskill and Croton systems, provide the city's drinking water -- were required to keep the Delaware River at levels mandated by law. The city released a record-setting 110 billion gallons into the Delaware River. And Mr. Bloomberg said that a leak in one of the city's supply tunnels pours out 20 million to 38 million gallons of water each day. But he said that fixing the leak, which has existed for decades, would prove difficult and would drain a number of ponds and streams that have formed above it. The city declared a drought watch on Dec. 23, meaning that officials calculated that there was only a 50 percent chance that city reservoirs would be full by June. Mr. Bloomberg said that the city would upgrade the watch to a drought warning within days, which would signal that the chances the reservoirs would fill up by June had dropped to 33 percent. New Yorkers use an average of 1.2 billion gallons of water each day, officials said. Water consumption has fallen in the past few years; as recently as 1991, the city went through an average of 1.45 billion gallons a day. Officials attributed the decline to conservation efforts, especially the installation of 1.7 million water-saving toilets and other plumbing fixtures. Under a drought warning, the city would call for voluntary conservation measures, restrict water use for Parks Department fountains and golf courses, ask the Sanitation Department to suspend street flushing activities and would call on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to reduce its fleet-washing activities. If things continue to worsen, and late winter and spring showers fail to materialize, the city would declare a drought emergency. That would happen only if officials decided that there was a reasonable probability that the city's reservoirs could be drained unless stringent mandatory measures were taken to reduce water consumption. The city's last drought emergency was in 1989. To forestall the need for a drought emergency, officials are urging people to begin saving water. Mr. Bloomberg asked New Yorkers to report open or leaking fire hydrants to the Department of Environmental Protection's 24-hour phone line, (718) DEP-HELP, or (718) 337-4357. He also called on residents to save water by turning off the taps while brushing teeth or shaving, running only full washing machines and dishwashers and sweeping driveways and sidewalks rather than hosing them down. ''We're all in this together,'' he said."
"PICTURE 60 one-gallon water jugs lined up outside your door. Now multiply those 60 jugs by the number of people in your household. The result, conservation experts say, is the amount of water your family will use on an average day. Now imagine there is a drought in your area. Wouldn't it be a good idea to save some of those jugs for tomorrow? ''Residential water consumption accounts for a huge chunk of total water consumption,'' said Alex Wilson, editor of Environmental Building News, a newsletter published in Brattleboro, Vt. ''And measures that homeowners take to conserve water are extremely important right now.'' Last month, officials in New York and New Jersey declared drought emergencies in those states; officials in Connecticut have declared drought warnings in New Haven, Middlesex and Fairfield Counties. And while the water use restrictions vary from state to state (instructions for obtaining state-specific details are provided at the end of this column), there are a number of things that homeowners can do to conserve water both inside and outside the home. For example, Mr. Wilson said, one inexpensive and effective way for homeowners to cut down on their water use is to install low-flow faucet aerators and shower heads on their plumbing fixtures. ''It may not seem like a big deal, but these devices can significantly reduce water usage,'' he said, explaining that while an older shower head can deliver water at 5 gallons per minute or more, appliances fitted with water-conserving devices can reduce the flow to as little as 1.5 gallons per minute. (That means that someone who takes a 10 minute shower could save 35 gallons of water a day just by replacing the shower head.) While some older water-saving devices used on sinks and showers did little more than reduce the amount of water coming out of the spigot -- an annoying result for many homeowners -- some state-of-the-art water-saving devices available today produce the feeling of lots of water and pressure while cutting the actual amount of water used by as much as 70 percent. For example, Mr. Wilson said, a water-saving shower head manufactured by Energy Technology Laboratories in Modesto, Calif., ''supercharges'' the water by injecting air as the water passes through the shower head. ''You end up with a forceful shower that uses only 1.5 to 2.5 gallons of water per minute,'' he said. (The shower head, the Oxygenics Skin Care Shower, which costs $29.95, is not sold in home centers or hardware stores, but it can be purchased on the Internet at the manufacturer's Web site at www.energytechlabs.com.) A device that can be used on kitchen and bathroom faucets to cut down significantly on the water being used while still retaining the feel of high pressure and volume is known as a ''laminar flow control'' adapter. ''When you turn on an old-fashioned faucet, you have a solid column of water coming out of the faucet and going down the drain,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''But with a laminar flow faucet, you basically have a hollow cylinder of water coming out, and that fools you into thinking there's a lot more water flowing than there actually is.'' (The laminar flow adapter -- which sells for about $10 -- is available from Omni Products in Harbor City, Calif. The company's Web site is www.omnidealers.com. Another gadget that can save significant amounts of water in the kitchen or bathroom, Mr. Wilson said, is a pedal controller, which is basically a secondary on- and off- control that is installed on the floor in front of the sink. ''You set the water temperature by opening the valves on the main faucet, and then you turn the water on and off by stepping on the pedal,'' Mr. Wilson said. Information about the pedal controller, which costs about $300, can be obtained from Pedal Valves, Inc., in Luling, La. (www.pedalvalve.com.) Yet another way to save water at the sink, Mr. Wilson said, is to install a Metlund Hot Water D'MAND System. ''Normally, when you turn on your hot water, you have to wait for the hot water to get to the sink,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''And while you're waiting, water is running down the drain.'' With the Metlund system, he said, a small pump and valve assembly is installed in the plumbing system. When hot water is desired, the homeowner presses a button on the D'MAND controller, which then pumps hot water to the point of use. Since the faucet is opened only after the hot water has reached the point of use, no cold water is wasted. The system -- which can be installed by a plumber or a relatively handy homeowner -- costs about $330 and is available on the company's Web site (www.metlund.com.) By far, though, Mr. Wilson said, one of the most notorious water-guzzlers in a home is an old-fashioned toilet. ''The toilet is typically the biggest water consumer in the house,'' he said. ''And I would strongly encourage every homeowner to replace their old inefficient toilets with new low-flow models.'' Robert Bellini, president of Varsity Plumbing and Heating in Flushing, agreed. ''Low-flow toilets have come a long way in the last five years,'' Mr. Bellini said. He noted that while early versions of the water-saving 1.6 gallon-per-flush toilets were less than a hit with consumers -- owners of some first-generation low-flow toilets often had to ''double-flush'' to get the job done -- toilets on the market today flush as well as the water-guzzling models they replace. Mr. Bellini, a contractor who participated in a New York City toilet rebate program that ended several years ago -- which provided property owners with a rebate for replacing old 5- or 6-gallons-per-flush toilets with new low-flow appliances -- said 1.6 gallon-per-flush toilets can be purchased at home centers or plumbing supply stores for under $100. (The cost of installation, he said, can run $200 to $250 in the New York City area.) A less expensive but less effective way to save water with an older toilet is to install a displacement device in the water tank. A sealed half-gallon water container installed in the tank, for example, will save a half gallon of water per flush. While that might not seem like much, Mr. Bellini said, a family of five that flushes five times a day each -- the national average -- will save 350 gallons of water each month. Another way to conserve water in a home is to make sure that existing faucets and toilets are not leaking. Geoffrey C. Ryan, a spokesman for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, said a steadily dripping faucet can send 180 gallons of water down the drain each day while a leaking toilet can waste 250 gallons. And while the waste of water alone should be enough to inspire a homeowner to ferret out such leaks and fix them, the actual cost of those leaks over a one-year period -- about $307 and $426 respectively, including New York City sewage charges -- provides an even more compelling incentive. (Mr. Bellini, the plumber, said that one way to find out if a toilet is leaking is to put some food coloring in the tank. If the color ends up appearing in the bowl without the toilet being flushed, the tank is leaking and either the flushing mechanism or the seal between the tank and the bowl will have to be replaced.) Outside the home, one of the biggest consumers of water, of course, is the front lawn. And while areas with declared drought emergencies typically have restrictions in place for the watering of lawns, it is not unusual for homeowners to overdo it during the times they are permitted to use their sprinklers. ''Most people tend to overwater their lawns,'' said Tom Kimmel, executive director of the Irrigation Association, a trade association based in Falls Church, Va. For most lawns, Mr. Kimmel said, one inch of water per week -- spread out over two or three days -- is probably sufficient. ''The trick is knowing how long you have to water to put down an inch,'' he said, adding that one way to determine that is to place ''catch cans'' at various places on the lawn to determine how long a sprinkler system must run to deliver a desired amount of water for a given watering period. And for sprinkler systems on an automatic timer, Mr. Kimmel said, water can be conserved with the installation of a rain sensor. ''If it's raining when the sprinkler system is supposed to turn on, the sensor overrides the controller and prevents the system from activating,'' he said, adding that such sensors are relatively inexpensive -- $25 to $50 in most home centers.

"THERE was a time New Yorkers could handle a blizzard or anything else nature threw at us. We were tough. We were New Yorkers. In the 1960's, when massive snowstorms brought the city to a standstill, my dad was a city bus driver. and the overtime he earned during those storms allowed him to put a down payment on the house in Queens I grew up in. Even though some parts of the city didn't see a plow for a week, most New Yorkers took the storms in stride. But today, as we face a water shortage and, since March 26, a drought emergency, it is clear that we are not cut from the same hearty stock as our forebears. We are weather whiners. Maybe we've been spoiled by a string of relatively mild winters. Or maybe we're just never satisfied. In the heart of winter I hear: ''Al, when is it going to warm up?'' ''When will we see the sun?'' During the summer these same people ask, ''When is it going to cool off?'' ''How about a break in the heat?'' We've become a nation of complainers and New York is no exception. We had a virtually snow-free winter, and now we're paying for it with drought conditions. The last couple of weeks have brought needed showers. But people still come up to me and ask, ''When is it going to stop raining?'' Even though we know it's politically incorrect, the complaints are registered anyway. Luckily, nature pays no attention to our ranting and whining. Once a New York snowstorm meant at least a foot. Today, a few inches throw us into a panic. ''Oh, no! It's going to snow!'' ''Quick, stock up on groceries!'' What happened to us? Television is part of the problem. To boost ratings, local news management wants us weather people to play up the storm. ''Big Storm Coming. How Much? New Ice Age? End of the World as We Know It? Details at 11!'' When I was a local TV weatherman, I was as guilty as my brethren at the other New York stations. Every news director in town drools with anticipation if a big storm is headed this way in a ratings sweeps month. In the summer of 1985 the city faced a a drought emergency. Reservoirs were dry, lawns brown and swimming pools empty. I remember saying on the air at WNBC that we would need a hurricane bringing 10 or 15 inches of rain to alleviate the situation. Hurricane Gloria obliged us that September with close to 15 inches. End of drought, end of story. That could happen this year. But we shouldn't count on it, and we shouldn't whine either.

"The potent drought that has parched much of the East since last fall has communities from Maryland to Maine facing limits on new construction, higher water charges, restrictions on water use, and the prospect of many more dry months without relief. If the drought drags on, possible delays in linking new housing or businesses to overburdened water systems could cause economic setbacks, water experts said. For the moment, no one has tallied the impacts, which are usually felt community by community, well by well. Many water systems, including those in Frederick, Md.; Greensboro, N.C.; and many towns near Boston and around New Jersey, were straining to meet demand even before the dry spell settled in. Increasingly, state and local rules require that developers show there is adequate water before new housing is built. In many places where growth has outstripped supplies, that is becoming a significant hurdle. It is unlikely that relief will come soon. Federal meteorologists say there is less than an 8 percent chance that rainfall from now through July will end the drought in coastal Maine and Connecticut, Long Island, New York City, New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, northern Maryland, South Carolina and Georgia. In many other dry regions, the chance that the drought will end this summer is only slightly higher, according to the predictions by the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C. But those predictions presume that conditions over the next few months will be typical for the time of year. Lately, nothing about the weather has been typical. Flow gauges in streams up and down the East Coast show record lows day after day. Even scattered downpours like the ones that drenched parts of the East on Friday offer little relief. The potential for damage to the economy is considerable. Vegetable and milk prices will rise as produce dwindles from farms in the Northeast. Restrictions on water use could hurt small businesses, forcing car washes, for example, to cut back their hours, or machine tool shops, which are often big users of water as a coolant, to reduce production, or causing well drillers to dig deeper for water, at higher cost. Some tourists might alter their vacations, avoiding the Northeast and its hotels. So far, the economic damage has only been spotty and minor. Mike Saulle, owner of the Centre Ridge Nursery in Nutley, N.J., said yesterday that fewer landscapers were placing large orders for shrubs and trees. The New York State Restaurant Association said some restaurants were offering bottled water at half price and not serving tap water unless customers asked for it. The Philadelphia Suburban Corporation, a water company, reported that restrictions on water use had contributed to a slight decline in earnings. Because of water restrictions, marinas on the Rockland County banks of the Hudson River have stopped offering boat-washing services to yacht owners, losing a significant source of revenue, employees said. The drought in the Northeast, if it endures, would show up first in the national economic statistics as a rise in the Consumer Price Index, economists say. The increase in this inflation gauge would not be significant because most of the nation's food is grown elsewhere, they contend, but any increase in inflation just as the economy is recovering from recession could make Wall Street investors extra jittery about interest rates. ''Think of the drought as a supply shock,'' said Richard Berner, an economist and forecaster at Morgan Stanley. He said the shock from this drought has not yet been sufficient to be noticeable in food prices or food quality. Early summer corn could be the first test of the drought's impact on prices. Like other economists, Mr. Berner has not yet included the drought or its potential for damage in his forecasts, which currently predict a steady and healthy recovery from recession. If anything, the dry and unseasonably warm weather in the first quarter encouraged more than normal home construction, helping to lift the economy. ''I am factoring in the drought as a potential risk,'' Mr. Berner said, ''but not a problem yet.'' The last year eastern states were poised to enter summer with such a deficit of rain was 1966, said Jay Lawrimore, the director of climate monitoring at the data center in Asheville. Many areas are more than a foot below their normal precipitation totals, including New York City and much of New Jersey. ''Things are not looking good,'' Mr. Lawrimore said. In 1966, the northeastern drought became so bad that the mayor of York, Pa., John L. Snyder, offered $350 of his own savings to a professional rainmaker, according to local newspaper archives. Now York County is in its fifth severe drought in the last seven years. But the effects, should the current drought persist, are likely to be far greater than they were 36 years ago because population, the economy and water use have grown sharply since then, particularly in the suburbs. The increased demand is putting ever more strain on water systems, be they a municipal reservoir serving expanding suburbs or a private well serving an enlarged house with more bathrooms and lawn sprinklers. Add a prolonged drought to the effects of prosperity and rising populations, and problems are inevitable, including higher costs. ''Usually, a utility will institute a reverse price structure so the more water you use, the more you pay per unit, to accomplish some measure of conservation,'' said Bill Lauer, a water engineer at the American Water Works Association, a Denver trade group representing 57,000 private and public water suppliers. He said the West was used to chronic water limits. ''We've had these restrictions so often it's become a way of life,'' Mr. Lauer said. But for the East, he said, this is something new. The prospect of serious, costly shortages is what led New Jersey, Maryland, New York City and other places to institute the first water restrictions long before largely unused snow shovels were stashed away. Now, central Maryland, New Jersey, New York City, eastern Pennsylvania and many other communities have moved to drought emergencies, with mandatory restrictions and fines for infractions in most of these places. The abrupt, record-setting heat wave that last week had the Middle West and the East feeling like August in April made matters worse, not only by evaporating precious groundwater, but also by stirring trees, shrubs and grass into early explosive growth, pulling yet more water from the soil. Meteorologists define a heat wave as three consecutive days with temperatures reaching 90 degrees or higher, and that is exactly what struck New York City and the surrounding region Tuesday until Thursday, only the second time in a century that a heat wave occurred in April. The last one was in 1976. ''Everything leafed out quickly because of the heat,'' said David Reynolds, a senior meteorologist for the National Weather Service. With the ground already bereft of moisture after a largely snowless winter and a dry fall, the demand from fast-growing vegetation creates further drying just as the hottest months approach, he said. ''All those trees are sucking up whatever moisture is available, so whatever rain falls has much less effect,'' Mr. Reynolds said. ''It'd have to rain a quarter-inch a day just to counterbalance what's going back up into space through evaporation.'' In many places affected by the drought, there is a sense of disquiet, linked to the idea that humans are witnessing not only natural vagaries, but deeper shifts in longstanding climate patterns. It remains far too soon to conclude with statistical certainty that the regional perturbations in weather patterns are the result of a global warming trend that scientists say is being influenced by humans. But whatever is causing the changes, many people seem to have lost their faith in the seasons. In the Hudson Valley north of New York City, the drought has been less severe than in some places. Enough showers have fallen to swell lilac buds and burst forsythia into yellow floral fireworks. But even there, water problems are growing, and the storms are never quite enough. Last Wednesday, on the stifling night after the temperature in Central Park reached 96 degrees, restless residents up and down the valley stirred to the sound of approaching thunder. For most, though, the rumbling rolled closer, distant lightning flashed, trees rustled in a rising breeze -- and then nothing. Nary a raindrop. Thunderstorms did spottily soak places Friday night, and cooler, more typical temperatures returned to the region yesterday. But no one was counting on the return of the rains. In Hopewell Junction, N.Y., on the receding rural fringe 56 miles north of Manhattan, William G. Jordan, 50, saw the well in his backyard run dry last week and had to call in a drilling crew. The wells for three other houses on his road failed recently, he said. His house and the others had been built on farmland 25 years ago, with shallow wells drawing on plentiful water stored in gravel beds just 40 or 50 feet down. But more and more developments were built, with wells sucking more water. With no rain to replenish the supply, his pump whirred but pulled nothing. Off and on, ''there was barely enough to flush the toilets and brush your teeth,'' Mr. Jordan said. On Friday afternoon, Dan Boyd's 45-foot-tall drilling rig was parked behind Mr. Jordan's white split-level, cutting slowly into the bedrock below, going 200 feet or more, until it hit flowing water. Mr. Boyd said he was very busy these days, like many other drillers, facing a backlog of weeks of work from Lake Placid to Brooklyn. Mr. Jordan said the new well would cost $5,000 to $10,000, depending on how deep the driller had to dig. The harsh reality of dry times, for him, was no longer just a brown lawn. He said he would never take water for granted again. ''If you got it, you're lucky,'' he said. ''If you can, conserve it, because when you don't have it, it's trouble.'' As Mr. Boyd and his assistant monitored the slow descent of the spinning drill, more anvil clouds rolled in from the west, ushering in the weekend cool front. The pewter clouds rumbled to the south and north, flecked by lightning, but the dusty grass around the chattering drill remained dry."
"Pity the Angel of the Waters, waterless for the first time in years, and the thoroughly modern F. Scotts and Zeldas: their splashing ground is dry. The Angel, the winged crown of the Bethesda Fountain in Central Park, and the fountain where the Fitzgeralds had their celebrated Jazz Age walk-through (the Pulitzer, in front of the Plaza Hotel), are not being turned on this year to save water. The same with more than 50 other fountains in parks around the city, and with fountains in plazas like the ones at Lincoln Center and Rockefeller Center or the waterfalls in small parks in Midtown. And fountains are not the only outdoor landmarks going dry this year. Anything that uses water for ''ornamental purposes'' was covered by the drought emergency that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg declared last month. So the pool beneath the stainless steel Unisphere in Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens is empty, too. ''It's not a happy thing to do,'' the parks commissioner, Adrian Benepe, said. ''It's almost like wartime rationing. It has to be done for the greater good.'' The regulation has left newer fountains looking like something out of a plumbing-supply store, all pipes and valves, dry and rusty, suddenly in full view. The older ones, built with their inner workings hidden, stand like unexpectedly silent statues. If not, said Geoffrey C. Ryan, a spokesman for the city's Department of Environmental Protection, there would be ''a perception issue.'' ''The reasoning behind the regulation is it drives home the notion of a drought to people when they see a fountain that isn't running,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''When they see one running, they say, 'Look at all the water being wasted.' '' Mr. Benepe may be able to walk across the dry basin of the Bethesda Fountain, as he did one morning last week, but he is swimming in numbers. Filling the fountains his agency runs would take 1.3 million gallons initially. Mr. Benepe likes to compare the initial fill-up to loading a giant water gun -- a 66,000-gallon squirter in the case of the Bethesda Fountain, for example. Topping the fountains off once they went into operation would use another 41,000 gallons a day. Those figures reflect a basic fact of fountains: most of the 55 on city-owned parkland recirculate water, so fairly little is wasted. ''What they have in common with fire hydrants and irrigation systems is they all draw on the same system that provides drinking water,'' Mr. Benepe said. ''This was all built in the 19th century when there was no sense that water would ever become scarce. The city of the future will have some kind of gray-water system, with one kind you need to drink and cook with and another to flush toilets with and run fountains and do things that don't require such a level of purity.'' The Bethesda Fountain loses only about 200 gallons a day to evaporation, leakage and the wind, which blows some water away even on calm days. Still, that adds up to 5,600 gallons a month. By contrast, the Washington Square Fountain ''practically has to be replenished every day,'' he said, because its older pumping equipment is far less efficient. Then there is the Heinrich Heine Fountain in Joyce Kilmer Park in the Bronx. It does not have a recirculating system, Mr. Benepe said, and would use 100,000 gallons a day if it were turned on -- far more than, say, the recirculating fountain outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Fifth Avenue. ''It's sad looking, isn't it?'' said Harold Holzer, a spokesman for the museum. ''I don't think we're making an impact on the reservoir level, but we're doing our bit for a parched city.''"
"WHAT'S a civic-minded apartment dweller to do in this drought emergency? Since Monday, New Yorkers have been forbidden to hose down driveways, to operate ornamental fountains, to water lawns except under tight restrictions, or to wash cars, unless they do so with well water. (When did you last fill your ewer at the neighborhood well?) Obviously, shutting off spigots makes sense in a crisis. But here's this poor sap, a Manhattan resident living six floors up. He has no lawn to not water. He has no driveway. He doesn't even own a car that he can leave outside gathering dirt in the name of civic virtue. As for an ornamental fountain, it is no more a part of apartment life than a pink flamingo or lantern-holding jockey. There is this pent-up yearning for personal sacrifice, but almost no municipally sanctioned way to act on it. Long before Monday, the house plants were being watered with hand-held containers, as the city's Department of Environmental Protection now advises. Showers were already shortened. The water was not left running during a shave or teeth-brushing. What we really have is a crisis of self-abnegation, a concern that has become increasingly apparent, on many levels, since Sept. 11. Americans have clearly shown their readiness, even eagerness, to make sacrifices in the war on terrorism, if only not to feel bad about leaving the entire burden to a few soldiers in Afghanistan. But about the only thing urged upon them by their political leaders is to go forth and shop. Otherwise, they are told, the terrorists will have won. For many, patriotism means flying an American flag from an imported S.U.V. burning up lots of Saudi oil. In New York City, sacrifice has been a central political theme since the first signs that the municipal budget would run billions of dollars in the red. But the pain has been far from evenly divided. When you get down to it, wealthier New Yorkers have not been asked to give up very much. They have never depended on many of the services that City Hall proposes to cut. Their children tend not to go to public schools. They usually live in safe neighborhoods. They are most unlikely to turn to homeless shelters, public housing, municipal centers for the elderly and other programs facing imminent budget reductions. They could sacrifice, and at the same time feel better about themselves on the war's home front, by giving the city a bit more money. One suggestion some have made is a temporary income-tax surcharge, similar to the ''safe streets'' levy that went to hire more police officers a decade ago. When times turned good and crime went down, that surcharge was repealed. Some have proposed a new surtax to improve schools, a subject dear to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. IN the spirit of shared sacrifice, nonresidents who make their living here could be asked to accept a reimposition of the commuter tax, eliminated by Albany in 1999 at a cost to the city of roughly $500 million a year. The average commuter barely noticed that tax. Typically, it came to 86 cents a day. Albany's leaders repealed it in a frenzy of sectarian politics. Why could it not be restored, even in this state election year, as a relatively painless show of solidarity with the city hurt the most by the terrorists? One reason is that Mr. Bloomberg takes an extremely dim view of taxes. Understood. Nonetheless, the result is that those with the deepest pockets are not sharing the burden in the one way they can contribute best. A similar point could be made about the drought emergency. For some reason, people who own private swimming pools are being allowed to fill them, for now anyway. Golfers are still able to enjoy watered tees and greens. If a fairly expensive restaurant visited on Monday night is a guide, the H2 O police will have to be called out to enforce the new requirement that water be served only when the customer requests it. The city's own statistics show that New Yorkers are prepared to give more of themselves. Daily water consumption, a little over 1.1 billion gallons, has dropped during the last two months by about 40 million gallons, the Department of Environmental Protection says. Some days, the decline has reached 50 million gallons. ''People sort of take it as a civic responsibility to cut back,'' said Charles G. Sturcken, the department's chief of staff. ''That's good.'' Yes, it is. And it is why City Hall could probably ask for even deeper sacrifices of us all, including those who are lawnless in Manhattan. NYC"
"As New York's drought emergency continues unabated, and the prospect of a long, hot summer continues to morph into that of an infernal, bone-dry one, trout anglers are facing a variation on that most famous of Shakespearean, existential questions: to fish or not to fish. With the upstate reservoirs that supply New York City only about half full (customarily, the large impoundments on the East and West branches of the Delaware River are so full at this time of year that water is spilling over their dams), city officials loathe as ever to release any more cold water than they must, and no state regulations in place to protect trout at times when they are thermally stressed, the stage is set for an ecological catastrophe. As disaster scenarios go, this one is pretty simple. When New York City planners had the foresight -- and imperial moxie -- to buy up vast tracts of water-rich Catskill land and create a reservoir system for the growing metropolis, they conquered and radically transformed the ecology of large river systems like those of the two waterways that meet at Hancock, N.Y., to create the Delaware River -- the East and West branches. Now those watersheds, which have become premier flyfishing destinations and significant contributors to the struggling upstate economy, are utterly dependent on cold-water releases from the large dams that block the rivers. The less water the rivers get, the more quickly and severely they become thermally inhospitable to the creatures that have flourished there since the dams were built. This past week, the West Branch at Hale Eddy a few miles below Cannonsville Reservoir was flowing at 142 cubic feet a second, when the 80-year mean for this time of year is about 1,210 c.f.s. As of last week, water managers were releasing just 23 c.f.s. from Cannonsville, the minimum required during drought emergency. The irony is that the unseasonably dry weather and unusually low and warm water have created excellent early-season flyfishing, with fly hatches well ahead of schedule. But only a myopic angler would fail to recognize the alarming signals in those unusual conditions. ''If the city continues to release the minimum amount of water and forecasts for a hot and dry summer prove out, there's a real threat of a severe fish kill as early as May,'' said Nat Gillespie, Catskills coordinator for Trout Unlimited. ''That big kill-off could be avoidable if New York City and and the D.R.B.C.'' -- the Delaware River Basin Commission, representing the interests of the four Delaware-river user states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware -- ''can be convinced to release more cold water.'' The battle between conservationists and other user groups and the Delaware water managers, principally those for New York City, has been lengthy, acrimonious and perhaps needless. After all, the city even has the vast reserves of the upper Hudson river right on its doorstep. That New Yorkers are profligate with water is clear: according to statistics compiled by Trout Unlimited, the per capita consumption in New York City is 160 gallons a person per day -- almost three times that of a resident of Boston, and about five times that of a European. As Jim Serio, executive director of the Delaware River Foundation, said: ''Normally, upstate New York gets about 45 inches of rain per year. The bottom line is that there's plenty of water for everyone, including trout.'' In fact, the shortcomings and the conflicts bred by the current water management system are such that the Delaware commission has been ordered to create a new, comprehensive management plan. But that does not help the Delaware River trout in the projected drought-plagued short term. In order to survive this summer, the fish will need cold water, and they may need compassion not just of water managers but anglers too -- particularly catch-and-release flyfishers. For there is little point in releasing a fish that is going to die because it has been caught. Trout are cold-blooded creatures that function most efficiently in water temperatures in the high 50's to upper 60's. When the temperature hits 70 degrees, rainbow and brown trout begin to suffer the effects of thermal stress, and as it rises above that critical number, their bodily functions begin to shut down. Gillespie said that studies have shown that brown trout simply cannot eat enough to sustain their body weight once the water temperature reaches 72 degrees. Left to their own devices, trout might be able to survive such high temperatures by conserving their energy and seeking refuge in deep, shaded pools or riverbed spring seepages. But the additional stress they experience by being caught can be, and often is, lethal. This, incidentally, is why many Canadian Atlantic salmon rivers routinely are shut down when the water becomes dangerously low and warm. Although state trout managers in the United States avoid such closures, an increasing number of flyfishers voluntarily desist from fishing when the water temperature reaches 70. You may see them next month, standing in the river holding up thermometers like Hamlet once held the skull of poor Yoric, asking themselves the question that all flyfishers now more than ever before should address.

"New Yorkers wilted yesterday, the second day of a hot spell that seemed to have wandered out of deep summer. The temperature hit 96 degrees yesterday afternoon in Central Park -- making this the hottest place in the country except for parts of Virginia. Many, no doubt, thought of escaping to someplace cooler. Miami, maybe -- where it was a pleasant 84. Or Phoenix, a brisk 77. They could not have done much worse. The unseasonable heat stretched from the Midwest and Ohio Valley throughout the entire Northeast, said Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. In the New York metropolitan area, cities from Newark and Hartford to White Plains reported temperatures in the low 90's. But New York City -- with temperatures tying a record set in 1976 -- was the hottest of all of them. The heat is not expected to dissipate until tomorrow evening or Saturday, Mr. Miner said. Over the weekend, more normal April temperatures of 60 degrees are predicted, he said, adding that thunderstorms will probably occur late tomorrow. In a season of drought, the abrupt rise in temperatures is making a serious water shortage worse, said Geoffrey C. Ryan, a spokesman for the city's Department of Environmental Protection. Water consumption began to rise along with the hot weather last weekend, and has increased since. Yesterday, 1.13 billion gallons were used, the most since drought emergency restrictions went into effect more than two weeks ago, Mr. Ryan said, and one of the highest since Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg issued a drought warning in January. Yesterday, the Department of Environmental Protection closed off 88 illegally opened fire hydrants, Mr. Ryan said. The fine for prying off a hydrant cap is $750, he said. He expects many more caps will be opened through tomorrow, he said, before the weather turns cool again. Mr. Miner said that the heat had been been caused by a hot air mass that began moving east from the Midwest days ago. At the same time, the jet stream -- which acts as a divider between the warm air currents from the South and the cooler ones from the North -- has moved much higher than usual, ranging up to northern Ontario. As a result, the hot air mass has spread over a vast northern region, Mr. Miner said. Along the southern coast of Long Island, however, cool ocean breezes lowered temperatures yesterday afternoon to 77 degrees."
"Tracing a Common Name Q. Since the million daffodils given to New York by the Dutch in remembrance of Sept. 11, I find myself at odds with a neighbor from the South who calls them jonquils. Isn't a jonquil something else? A. Daffodils, nature's apology for winter, belong to the genus Narcissus. All daffodils can be called narcissus, and vice versa. But jonquils are a special case. Colonists brought Narcissus jonquilla and similar species and selections when they came. These daffodils took a liking to the Southeast because, as natives of Spain, they do particularly well in areas with warm winters and hot summers. Many other daffodils won't grow well in the South. Narcissus jonquilla not only grew, it prospered, naturalizing widely in the region. I doubt that any of the narcissus in the wonderful gift to New York City from the people and the bulb growers of the Netherlands are those classic jonquils, which bloom later. Jonquils have characteristic small, flat-petaled, sweetly fragrant flowers, usually two or three to a stem, and dark green, narrow, rushlike foliage. Over the years, usage in the South has extended the common name jonquil to include other daffodils. This is language in motion. Common names start regionally and gradually spread. Given enough time, maybe we'll all end up calling narcissus jonquils. It does have a nice ring to it. To Plant or Not Q. Our block association holds an annual spring event where we clean out and plant the tree pits, typically with ivy and impatiens. In view of the current drought we are considering xeriscaping. Can you recommend any drought-resistant plants that would survive the summer in tree pits? A. The ideal would be that this summer, just for a change, you practice zeroscaping -- not planting anything that would compete with the tree for water. Any new plants, even those that are drought resistant, need regular watering to become established. Whether they need a lot or a little, they take their water from the limited supply that would otherwise go to the tree. Which is more important to you, the tree or the pit? City trees have a tough enough time finding water -- why make it that much more difficult? Clean up by all means, but then lay down three to four inches of an organic mulch like shredded bark instead of planting the pit full of competitors. Mulch solves the problem of looking at bare soil while it cools and holds moisture. Instead of the water being taken by the annuals, the more valuable tree is enjoying it all. Time to Check the Garden For every tender new leaf heralding spring's arrival, there's a pest lurking. Many overwintering insect populations boom following a mild winter, so gardeners should be especially vigilant right now, when many pests are out and in a stage of their life cycle that is vulnerable to the smothering effects of refined horticultural oil. Scale insects, for example, have a crawler stage where horticultural oil can easily kill them. But once inside their protective shells, some simply laugh off any attempt to deal with them. From the end of April into early May, a number of common pests are vulnerable, and scouting will show you if populations are large enough to warrant treatment. Follow directions carefully. Different dilutions of horticultural oil are used depending on whether leaf buds have broken. Scale insects are common on hemlock, privet, juniper, euonymus, and Prunus species. Mealybugs, mites, and adelgids are also susceptible to spraying with horticultural oil. Watch for mealybugs on yew and occasionally on dogwoods and crab apples. Adelgids are out on Douglas fir, Norway and white spruce, pine, and especially hemlock, and mites can be found on spruce, pine, hemlock, arborvitae, hawthorn, apple, Prunus species, holly, azalea and other broad-leaved evergreens. Garden Q & A"
"A steady 12-hour rain that began late Saturday night, followed by a burst of wind-whipped showers last night, brought a much needed respite to the drought-weary New York metropolitan region, with rainfall accumulations exceeding an inch from Trenton to Montauk and suddenly verdant hues adorning lawns, trees and spring vegetation. But , experts said the weekend soaking would be far from enough to replenish reservoirs or ease drought restrictions. ''This has been very helpful, a good, soaking rain,'' said Al Cope, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, N.J. ''But no single event is going to end the drought, and nobody will drop their drought restrictions tomorrow.'' By early this morning, the weather service recorded rainfall accumulations of 1.6 inches in Central Park in Manhattan, over 2 inches in Brookhaven, N.Y., and over an inch s in Bridgeport, Conn., Teterboro, N.J., and n Newark. The second line of showers spread across the region about 9 p.m. bringing dozens of reports of lightning and strong gusts. Weather service officials in New Jersey said early today that they had received several reports of lightning and wind damage, but the extent of the damage remained unclear. Tim Morrin, a meteorologist with the weather service's Brookhaven office, said two to three more hours of rain was expected, with some heavy downpours, adding as much as a half-inch to accumulations. The soaking came weeks after several government agencies, responding to drought conditions that have plagued the region since last year, imposed several restrictions on water use. In New York City, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg declared the first drought emergency since 1989, and ordered a series of water-saving measures, including restrictions on washing cars, hosing down sidewalks and watering lawns. Mr. Morrin said the weekend rain would relieve the drought conditions only if it signaled a new weather pattern that brings an extended period of heavier-than-normal rain. ''The significance is not in an event, but a trend,'' Mr. Morrin said. ''To really make an impact on a drought that has taken several months to create, we would need several months of above-average rainfall.'' Rainfall accumulation remains far below normal for the year, with shortfalls from 7 to 13 inches across the region, he said. Brief periods of heavy rain do little to replenish low levels in the region's reservoirs, he said. Still, Mr. Morrin said, the weekend rain should lift spirits, even if it does not fill reservoirs. ''We are not horticultural experts, but we are observant,'' he said. ''It is nice how a rainfall like this can perk things up.''"
"The weekend rainstorms may not have made much of a dent in the region's drought, but New Jersey has at least agreed to soften its water restrictions for some South Jersey residents for the second time this year. Yielding once again to the imperatives of suburban living, the State Department of Environmental Protection is preparing to permit limited lawn watering in southern counties where it had been banned. Last month, shortly after imposing the country's first statewide water use restrictions, the agency calmed the cries of pool owners and pool companies by ending the ban on refilling pools that had been drained for the winter. The relaxation of the lawn-watering rule, which is expected to be announced this week, came after a meeting on April 18 between D.E.P. officials and representatives from water utilities and lawn care companies in South Jersey, who complained that their region had plenty of water and that their businesses were suffering because of the restrictions. According to participants in a later meeting between state water regulators, utilities and lawn business operators last week, the new rules will allow homeowners in the southern coastal counties, who are now not allowed to water at all, to turn on the sprinklers two days a week. Commissioner Bradley M. Campbell of the D.E.P. said last week that the agency would ''modify restrictions for a trial period if the communities agree to meet specific and aggressive conservation targets.'' He acknowledged he had been under pressure to relent, and sounded as if he had some misgivings. ''One of the difficulties you have in a drought emergency is getting the public to understand that we face a serious problem and that they need to continue conservation,'' he said. Recent rains have brought rainfall levels for April to near-normal levels in New Jersey, but they have done little to compensate for the dry winter -- the driest in the state since record-keeping began in the late 19th century. New Jersey and New York City have declared drought emergencies and ordered water-saving measures, and other parts of the region remain on drought warnings. Commissioner Campbell said New Jersey would need 18 to 26 inches of rain -- roughly half a normal year's rainfall -- to bring the state out of a drought emergency. ''And the meteorologists tell us that we have a less than 5 percent chance of getting rains of that magnitude,'' he added, ''so we have to plan and manage for a tough dry season ahead.'' John Ferrie, an owner with his wife, Shawn, of Fresh Cut Lawn Care in Egg Harbor Township in Atlantic County, said that Mr. Campbell had agreed at a meeting last week to allow lawn watering twice a week in the Coastal South Drought Region on an odd-even basis by house number, provided that water supplies did not decline too far. ''He told us that if water levels drop down below 80 percent of where they should be normally at this time of the year, he is going to rescind it,'' Mr. Ferrie said. ''And obviously we agreed to that.'' Lawn watering makes up 30 percent to 50 percent of the average household's total water use during the summer months, according to the D.E.P. Currently, all lawn watering is forbidden except in the Central or Coastal North Drought Regions. Residents of those regions may water every other day, but Mr. Ferrie said to be consistent officials might limit those areas to the same twice-a-week schedule they plan to announce for the Coastal South. Statewide, the drought rules also forbid the washing of cars, boats, sidewalks and driveways at homes and the use of home power washers. Commercial car washing is allowed. Restaurants are allowed to serve tap water only if a customer asks. Mr. Ferrie's conciliatory tone was a far cry from the anger he and other South Jersey lawn care operators and water utilities officials directed at Mr. Campbell at the April 18 public meeting in Pomona. They claimed that water in the utilities' deep wells was at normal levels, that the local reservoir was overflowing and that the restrictions were hurting business and forcing layoffs. Mr. Ferrie, president of the South Jersey Landscape Association, said his company was down to 11 employees, from 25 in a normal spring, because homeowners were refusing to spend money on lawns that were likely to turn brown under the drought rules. He maintained that his region should not be put on the same strict water diet as the state's northeastern suburbs, where the water shortages are most severe. At that meeting, Mr. Campbell said it would be impossible to make drought restrictions stick if water utilities with deep wells and plentiful supplies were allowed to pump all they wanted, while many nearby residents had shallow, barely adequate private wells. ''From a communications perspective,'' he said, ''it's not a responsible message to ease restrictions on particularly well-situated water companies when those who you need to protect most are not so well served.''"
"New York City lifted its emergency drought declaration yesterday, suspending restrictions on water use that were imposed in April, when falling reservoir levels presented the likelihood of yet another crisis in a city already facing more than enough of them. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the frequent drenching rains that swept across the region in recent months, particularly in September and October, nudged the city's reservoirs back to about 68 percent of capacity, almost precisely normal for this time of year. When the restrictions end on Friday, New Yorkers will be able to wash their cars again, and the city's fountains will resume their old effervescence. The mayor stressed that the city would remain under a drought watch, with residents and businesses urged to conserve voluntarily. But the broader implication was just as clear: the worst is over. New York State now has no mandatory use restrictions anywhere, and neither does Connecticut. New Jersey eased restrictions last week on car washing and lawn watering, but remains in a drought emergency, largely because of depleted groundwater levels in areas dependent on wells. The real story, meteorologists said, is that once again the city and the region got lucky. Since 1998, they said, the Eastern Seaboard has been locked in a drought cycle of drier than normal weather, punctuated by periods of far greater than normal precipitation that served, again and again, to bring the system back from the brink. Hurricane Floyd did the trick in 1999. The last two months of ruined weekends and soggy commuting did it again this year. ''Just when we seem to be on the precipice of having an extremely threatening situation, we'll have a Floyd, or a wet spring,'' said Dave Robinson, a professor of geology at Rutgers University who serves as the New Jersey state meteorologist. Whether that bumpy pattern is really over -- in other words, whether the region has reached the official end of the drought or just another wet interlude -- remains an open question. The commissioner of the city's Department of Environmental Protection, Christopher O. Ward, who is responsible for the water supply, said he fully expected the wet-dry cycle to continue. Mr. Ward said he believed that more frequent droughts were likely in coming years, and that his department would rewrite water rules over the next nine months to incorporate permanent conservation incentives. ''Are we out of the woods?'' Mr. Ward said. ''The woods are now different, in a way. I think this weather cycle is going to require an ongoing awareness of conservation.'' Other weather experts said the four-year drought pattern was at least partly caused by a cold-water condition in the Pacific Ocean called La Niña (which also tends to stimulate more drenching Atlantic hurricanes like Floyd -- and thus the wet-dry pattern). But La Niña is now giving way to its warmer-water counterpart, El Niño, which tends to create wetter weather for the Eastern United States. Perhaps by coincidence, perhaps not, the El Niño pattern began to emerge this spring and summer, just as the region's weather turned wetter after a dry winter that deepened the drought and drained reservoirs to record low levels, especially in New Jersey. But there are also cycles within cycles, weather experts said. The last 30 years, for example, since about 1970, have been much wetter than normal in the Northeast -- by far the wettest 30-year stretch in the last century. In New Jersey, the 1970's were the wettest decade of the century, followed by the 1980's. The 1990's ranked fourth. The New York region, in making decisions about growth and water use, has come to count on that wetter weather as normal, climate experts and planners said. Conservation efforts through programs like reduced-flow plumbing fixture rules have been able to save hundreds of millions of gallons, and greater rainfall has added another cushion, allowing the region to continue growing without serious water worries. The city currently uses about 1.3 billion gallons a day, down from 1.6 billion in the early 1980's. The question going forward, especially if the off-again-on-again pattern resumes, is whether the limit of conservation, or at least the easy part, has already been achieved. ''How much more can you wring out -- that's the issue,'' said Charles G. Sturcken, the special counsel to the city's Department of Environmental Protection. And there is another wrinkle as well that meteorologists have yet to figure out, but which figures prominently in the city's rescue. The months of September and October are getting wetter. According to records compiled by the United States Geological Survey, wettest times of the year in North America, in the spring, have stayed about the same over the last 100 years, but the historically driest months -- September and October, in particular -- are becoming a bit wetter. Harry F. Lins, the drought science coordinator for the Geological Survey, said he did not have the faintest idea why that has happened. ''The more data we collect, the more we begin to appreciate how complex this system is and how little we understand it,'' he said."
"The drought is not officially over in New Jersey, but the state said yesterday that it was relaxing its restrictions on water use so that most residents could once again water their lawns and wash their cars at home. Bradley M. Campbell, the commissioner of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection, said October rainfall had eased the severity of the statewide drought, which has plagued the state for most of the year. The state first imposed water-use restrictions last March, after a dry winter, and has been tinkering with them ever since as reservoir levels have risen and fallen. Under the relaxed restrictions announced yesterday, residents may water their lawns every other day; those with an odd-numbered street address may water on odd-numbered days, and those with even house numbers may water on even-numbered days. Under the earlier restrictions, car washing was allowed only at commercial car washes. Residents will now be allowed to wash cars in their driveways on weekends but not during the week. Some municipalities may, however, impose their own standards, Mr. Campbell said. ''By no means should this action mislead people to think that the drought emergency is over,'' the commissioner said at a news conference yesterday. ''Instead, we must remain prudent. Water conservation continues to be of the utmost importance to ensure sufficient water supplies are available throughout the upcoming months.'' The relaxed restrictions come as lawns and gardens are going dormant. But other drought-related restrictions, including those allowing golf courses to use only 80 percent of their monthly water allocation, remain in effect. Officials also said these changes to the restrictions would not affect an executive order signed by Gov. James E. McGreevey last month banning the distribution of water to most new construction in the South Jersey communities of Egg Harbor Township, Galloway Township and Hamilton Township. Mr. Campbell said that rainfall in October reduced the immediate drought problems. That, combined with cooler temperatures in the last month, brought water levels up in some parts of the state, but the effect is spotty. The state's northeast reservoir systems show an increase of just over 2 percent from their historic average for this time of year, Mr. Campbell said, and groundwater supplies in North Jersey have also been rising. But, he said, the state's coastal plain continues to lag, with groundwater levels there remaining below normal. He said that is why the state is allowing townships to set their own restrictions. ''We need to err on the side of caution,'' Mr. Campbell said. ''We must remember that just as quickly as water levels rise with rain, they will drop immediately without it.'' Officials in New York City said they would wait a few weeks before considering doing away with drought emergency restrictions, put into place in April, that limit residents to lawn watering only on alternate days. Regardless, said Charles G. Sturcken, a spokesman for the city's Department of Environmental Protection, annual restrictions will go into effect on Nov. 1 that prohibit any lawn watering until March 31."
"Two Democratic senators accused the Bush administration today of spending money needed for school lunch and child nutrition programs on emergency drought assistance for ranchers. The senators. Tom Harkin of Iowa, chairman of the agriculture committee, and Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, chairman of the subcommittee on research and nutrition, said the drought relief could deprive the lunch and nutrition programs of at least $66 million. A spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department, Alisa Harrison, said the complaints, in a letter to Secretary Ann M. Veneman, were unfounded. Ms. Harrison said there was enough money to pay for drought aid without affecting any nutrition programs. ''That allegation is not true,'' she said. ''But we will look at their concerns and respond accordingly.'' The drought program, announced last month, could help several Republican Senate candidates in close Midwestern races, as well as their drought-stricken livestock producers. In what is becoming a major campaign issue, Democrats and Republicans have been jockeying to portray themselves as the saviors of thousands of rural families who face hardship because of the drought. The senators wrote in their letter that a better approach was a measure that the Senate passed on Sept. 10 to provide $6 billion in emergency disaster assistance for ranchers and farmers. The administration rejected that measure, saying it would drive up the deficit. On Sept. 19, Ms. Veneman announced the smaller relief package, with the money from a discretionary fund that largely pays for nutrition programs. She said the idea was from Representative John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who is in one of the closest Senate races. But a coalition of food and school groups, as well as advocates for the hungry, wrote to Senate leaders, warning that the drought program could jeopardize their work at shelters and schools in the winter. While agreeing that farmers and ranchers were in need after a year of drought, the groups wrote that federal help should not be given ''in a manner that compromises federal nutrition programs.'' In a letter on Oct. 1 to Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, and Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the minority leader, groups including the American Association of School Administrators, Bread for the World, the Food Research and Action Center and the National Education Association said there was not enough money in the program, known as Section 32, to pay for the new emergency aid for ranchers without hurting the poor and children. ''The federal budget may be tight, but many state, and local budgets are even tighter,'' the letter said. ''Schools, food banks and other charitable institutions rely heavily on the availability of bonus commodities, and this action will directly undermine their programs.'' After researching the $5.9 billion available under Section 32, Mr. Harkin and Mr. Leahy calculated that the fund would be $66 million in debt after the ranchers had been paid. Ranchers began applying on Oct. 1 for the money, at $18 a head of beef cattle as a baseline. Buffalo, goat and sheep owners are also eligible. An aide to Mr. Leahy, John Winski, said, ''The bottom line is the administration is using Enron-type accounting to pay for this election year program.''"
"Against the backdrop of the snowcapped Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the building lots stand ready, platforms for more new homes on the way to this steadily growing mecca in New Mexico's high desert. But before a single nail is pounded, builders like Mike Gibbs now face an additional, unusual hurdle. For every new home they build in Santa Fe, they must first install, free of charge, 8 to 12 new high-efficiency toilets in existing homes, hotels and shops. The purpose is to save water in a community with no more room for waste. Overtapped by drought and development, Santa Fe's current water supply can barely keep up with demand. The margins are so narrow that a bitterly divided City Council ruled in September that new construction could proceed only if its effects were offset by builders' swapping out old water-wasting toilets. The bigger the new home, the more new toilets must go in somewhere else. Builders like Mr. Gibbs, a thickly built man of 41, are grudgingly going along with the new rules, since the alternative could be more severe: some Council members have sought a moratorium on construction. But that does not make the builders any happier about what they see as a growing tendency to use water as a cudgel against growth. ''I got into this business to build new homes,'' Mr. Gibbs said. ''In order to keep building, I'm in the toilet business.'' In one sense, the new rules are just the latest tactic by Santa Fe's leaders to protect a city whose distinctive style, dictated by strict building codes, has attracted a growing influx of people. But more broadly, the rules speak to the kinds of hard choices and questions surfacing in communities across the West, where water supplies are being stretched to the limit by population growth and years of drought. Among the questions is whether there can be more growth without more water, how to acquire new water supplies, and what to do if such efforts fail. ''Obviously you can't do anything about the drought, and until you start issuing passports out of City Hall, you're not going to stop people from moving here,'' said Karl H. Sommer, who represents the Santa Fe Area Homebuilders Association, a fierce opponent of any building moratorium. ''So it's time that someone began talking about supply.'' Karen Heldmeyer, a city councilwoman who favors an all-out building moratorium, said the realistic approach would be for Santa Fe to begin to live within its limits. ''I'm not in favor of slowing down growth just to slow down growth,'' she said. ''But I think everyone in town understands that there's a relationship between growth and water use. And I don't want people who already live here to be in a perpetual stage of water shortage.'' Toilets are second only to outdoor sprinklers and garden hoses in consumption of domestic water supplies in the United States. Since 1994, federal law has required that all toilets in new homes be low-flow models, which use about 1.6 gallons per flush. But that law does not affect existing homes' many millions of older toilets, which tend to use more than twice that amount. Only now are communities trying to find ways to speed their replacement. Some, like Los Angeles, have used subsidies to encourage homeowners to make the switch. But other than Santa Fe, only one American city, San Luis Obispo, Calif., has experimented with a mandatory swap-out. Santa Fe's replacement program has the potential to be the largest yet, with permit-hungry builders installing about 4,000 toilets a year, at a cost of $250 to $300 each, in the homes and businesses of civic-minded residents and merchants. Santa Fe's population, now about 66,000, is increasing about 1.5 percent a year; Santa Fe County, of which it is the seat, is growing at 3.5 percent. For decades, almost nothing has been done to ensure that water supplies keep pace with that growth. Santa Fe's main water sources -- the Santa Fe River and city-owned wells -- have been depleted in recent years by overuse and periodic drought, including the current one, among the worst on record. To cope, Santa Fe has already cut domestic water consumption. Its average total water use -- 145 gallons per person per day for homes and businesses -- has fallen 20 percent since 1995 and is one of the lowest in the West. Even so, by this summer the level at its main reservoir had fallen to just 22 percent of capacity, with only a tiny faction of that considered usable. Since April, the city has enforced its strictest water-use limitations in years, including a ban on filling residential swimming pools and a rule that hotels change sheets and towels only every four days. Still, there were days this summer, said Dale Marie Doremus, environmental projects coordinator for Santa Fe's water department, when ''we were teetering on the brink,'' with water supplies barely keeping up with demand. At the same time, the demand for building permits had surged. By mid-July, the city had issued 473 permits this year for new single-family homes -- more in seven months than in any full year since 1990. At one point, the City Council did pass a building moratorium, only to rescind it later under pressure from the home builders and their supporters. The builders argued that such a move would amount to a closing of Santa Fe's borders and could have a severe economic effect. On average, city officials say, the toilet rules that were adopted last month are expected to add $3,000 to $4,000 to the cost of a new home, in a market where the median price is now about $265,000. But that additional cost does not include what builders like Mr. Gibbs say is considerable time spent contacting hotels, businesses and homeowners, looking for places to put new toilets. The toilet rules are to be reviewed in March, when studies aimed at clarifying Santa Fe's water picture are to be completed. At that time, the City Council is supposed to come up with a formal water budget specifying how much water, if any, can be spared for new development, and whether savings are needed elsewhere. The builders and their allies, including City Councilman Matthew Ortiz, say a long-term solution must include new water supplies for Santa Fe, partly entailing the spending of millions of dollars on infrastructure to take advantage of the city's rights to divert large quantities from the Colorado portion of the San Juan River. But experts like Ms. Doremus, the city water official, say that even in the long term, increasing competition for water in the state and across the West will make it hard for Santa Fe to acquire substantial new sources. ''There's a finite amount of water,'' she said. ''There are no hidden reserves. And what we're saying is that we don't have a lot of water to set aside for growth.''"
"New Jersey lifted the last restrictions on water use in the northern and central regions of the state today, but the state Commissioner of Environmental Protection said South Jersey ''might take years to recover'' from the prolonged drought. The commissioner, Bradley M. Campbell, said the statewide drought emergency would remain in effect. The emergency declaration, made in March, gives the commissioner the authority to reimpose restrictions quickly -- as he said he might need to do, given the longstanding pattern of below-normal precipitation and the depletion of aquifers. New York State also eased restrictions today, lifting a drought watch in the Catskills region. Water-use restrictions in New York City ended Nov. 1, although a drought watch, in which voluntary conservation is encouraged, remains in place for the city and for Rockland, Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk Counties. In New Jersey, the Department of Environmental Protection had banned car-washing, except in commercial car washes, along with outdoor fountains and watering lawns and gardens. Those rules were relaxed on Oct. 25 to allow car-washing on weekends and lawn-watering on an odd-even system. The restrictions remain in place in the southern counties and in Monmouth County and the southwestern half of Mercer County, including Trenton. New York and New Jersey have had an unusually rainy fall. New Jersey had the seventh-wettest October on record, and November rainfall is about half an inch above normal, said Dave Robinson, the state climatologist at Rutgers. In addition, said Mr. Campbell, the environmental commissioner, conservation has cut water use by about 30 percent. But Mr. Robinson said that the state had a rainfall deficit of 6 to 6 1/2 inches over the last 12 months, and that 37 of the last 52 months had been below normal. ''It's something unlike anything we've seen in the last 30 years,'' he said. Restrictions are continuing in South Jersey because the region is heavily dependent on groundwater. Aquifers, unlike reservoirs and rivers, take months to recharge, and Mr. Campbell said wells in South Jersey were still drying up at a much faster rate than normal. He said rapid development had compounded the drought effects. ''One of the lessons of this drought is that we can't continue to pave over areas that recharge groundwater,'' he said. ''We can't continue to fill in wetlands.'' Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, said the damage was worst in shore areas and the Philadelphia suburbs."
"Bill Hagarty once beat a drought by sending his 5,000 sheep on a six-month walkabout, feeding them on the grassy outcroppings along public roads, or what ranchers here call ''the long paddock.'' That was 20 years ago. Now Mr. Hagarty's 32,000-acre Rocks Station, 500 miles northwest of Sydney, is scorched again, but this time the drought has the entire country in its grip. Government officials are calling it Australia's worst drought in a century. While waiting for rains that would revive his prairie, Mr. Hagarty, 68, has been forced to sell most of his sheep. There has been no rain for the last seven months, and only five inches -- one-third the usual -- for the entire year. ''I'm down to 300 sheep and about 3,000 'roos,'' Mr. Hagarty said, talking of an invasion by kangaroos fleeing even drier land. He said the drought was the worst he could recall in his 43 years working in the Brewarrina district, a vast sheep run noted for thoroughbred Merino herds that produce premium wool for export. Sixty miles to the west, Wayne O'Malley and his wife, Patty, have 68,000 acres along the Darling River at Marion Downs, which in good years can support 8,000 sheep and 900 beef cattle. Now, after the longest dry spell recorded there in 60 years, they have sold their herds down to core breeding stock, which they are feeding with trucked-in grain and hay at a cost of about $1,000 a week. ''We can manage a 12-month drought but this is much worse,'' Mr. O'Malley said. ''We've had about 10 inches of rain in two years, one-third of the average. The river is almost dry, the dams are almost empty, nothing is growing and the kangaroos are digging up the grass roots.'' Local cotton growers are even worse off than ranchers. With no river water for irrigation, they did not plant this year. Irrigation of citrus fruits and table grapes has also stopped. ''The whole economy has taken a big hit,'' Mr. O'Malley said. The federal government's chief scientific adviser, Dr. Geoff Garrett, said the low rainfall over the last 18 months -- 50 to 70 percent below average -- amounted to ''the most severe national drought in Australia in 100 years.'' He and other officials warn that the ''Big Dry'' is likely to persist. Significant rain is not expected until April, after the decline of the current El Niño cycle, which is warming the ocean and affecting the climate in the Pacific Rim. The Reserve Bank, Australia's central bank, says the drought's effect on farm production will reduce the country's 4 percent growth rate, currently the strongest among developed nations, to 3 percent by next year. The government's agricultural economics agency estimates that grain and oil-seed harvests, which begin next month, will be about 20 million tons below last year's record 34 million tons. Urban and coastal areas have not been spared. Sydney just experienced its driest October since 1900, Melbourne has imposed restrictions on garden watering and car washing, and showers have been turned off on Queensland's surf beaches. The beach resort of Byron Bay, bracing for a million visitors in December and January, midsummer here, is advising vacationers to bring their own drinking water."
"Heavy rains that pounded the metropolitan area early yesterday soaked the ground for the second time in a week, bringing runoffs to depleted reservoirs and a lush sheen to lawns, parks and woodlands. But to a profoundly parched region, the downpours were little more than an impressive illusion. On a day when city streets and country roads were awash with minor flooding and unseasonable snows fell in parts of upstate New York, experts said that the precipitation was not nearly enough to end the worst drought in years, or to ease water restrictions that remain in force in New York and New Jersey. ''Certainly all this rain helps,'' said Chris Johannesson, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. ''But a drought like this doesn't get broken by one or two heavy rains. It would take a long period of consistent rainfall for this drought to go away.'' Nearly 1.5 inches of rain fell across the region Friday night and early yesterday, the National Weather Service reported. That rain and a similar drenching last Sunday and Monday contributed to a total rainfall of 6.2 inches over the last 30 days, Mr. Johannesson said. The total exceeded the 4.5-inch normal rainfall for the period by 1.7 inches. The heavy rains -- and snowfalls of 2 to 6 inches in the upper Hudson Valley and the Catskill and Berkshire Mountains yesterday -- have raised water levels in reservoirs upstate and along the Delaware River, but have fallen far short of ending the drought. Experts say that the precipitation in the region over the past year has been 12 to 15 inches below normal, and that it would take nearly that amount of extra rain -- over and above normal levels -- to ease the emergency. New York City's upstate reservoirs stood at 75.5 percent of capacity on Friday, while northern New Jersey reservoirs were at 73 percent, according to city and state environmental protection officials. The reservoir systems should be at 100 percent of capacity at this time of year. In New Jersey, where a drought emergency has been in effect since December, David Robinson, the state climatologist at Rutgers University, told The Associated Press that recent rains had made conditions ''far better than they were on the first of March,'' but that the emergency continued. ''It's still far from being declared over,'' he said. Mr. Johannesson agreed. ''The reservoirs have been going up slowly but surely over the past month,'' he said. But the gain has been relatively small, and looks can be deceiving. ''It seems so wet,'' he said, ''but this is normal rainfall for this time of year.'' Meteorologists say that the outlook for the remainder of the spring and for early summer is for near-normal temperatures and precipitation, which would do little to ease the drought conditions. Moreover, now is the time of year when water consumption generally increases, with the use of swimming pools and the watering of lawns. And rates of evaporation rise with warmer temperatures. Stephen Fybish, a Manhattan climatologist and New York weather historian, said yesterday that the six-month period from October to March was the driest on record in Central Park, with 10.46 inches of precipitation. That broke a 1965 record of 10.65 inches, he said. As one of the driest winters on record unfolded in New York City, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg issued a drought warning in January. In early April, he declared the first drought emergency since 1989, ordering conservation measures that included restrictions on watering lawns, washing cars and hosing sidewalks. In New Jersey, where many experts have compared conditions to the legendary drought of 1960-64, Gov. James E. McGreevey declared a drought emergency in March, restricting outdoor water use throughout the state. In late April, the ban on lawn watering was eased in southwestern, northwestern and south coastal sections of New Jersey as spring rains reached near-normal levels."
"A hypnotist was the featured guest at the soil conservation district's annual meeting here a few weeks ago, a fitting diversion for a place where it has not rained for nearly a year and the land seems to be in a hard trance. Across the state line from this southeastern Colorado town, in Syracuse, Kan., a crowd packed into the school gym to hear Dusty Dowd, a crop-duster, lead a prayer for rain. ''Lord, we ask that you might again bless us with the general, beneficial rains that are so vital to our crops and our lives,'' the prayer went. The soil is on the move again in the High Plains, drifting over a swath of the American midsection calcified by drought. For some, it is reviving memories of a time when the world seemed to blow away. There have been serious droughts here before, some as fierce as the dry spells of the 1930's. But this drought is among the worst, and in some counties, particularly in the northern plains, it is the most devastating in more than a century. In eastern Montana, more than a thousand wheat farmers have called it quits rather than try to coax another crop out of ground that has received less rain over the last 12 months than many deserts get in a year. Blinding dust storms have forced drivers off the road, dozens of businesses have folded in withered communities, and the entire state has been declared a federal disaster area for farmers. Wyoming is much the same. Here in southeastern Colorado, in the heart of the old Dust Bowl, the ground is so dry that agriculture officials say most of this state will not even produce a wheat crop. ''We've had severe drought before, but never four years in a row of terrible drought,'' said Jesse Aber, who directs Montana's drought task force. John Stulp, a farmer from this flat, wind-chipped corner of Colorado, added: ''It's drier around here than it has been for a hundred years. We've chiseled up the ground on land where we usually have wheat coming up, just to bring dirt clods up to hold the soil down.'' Drought is no stranger to much of the country this year, with 29 states suffering through a prolonged dry spell. The East, from Maine to Georgia, has been particularly hard hit. But what makes the drought stand out in the western Plains is the blowing dust, a haunt of the Dirty Thirties when brown blizzards carried sand all the way to the Atlantic Ocean and prompted more than three million people to leave their homes. While the storms this year have not been nearly as epic or debilitating as the brown clouds that rolled over the flatlands during the Depression, they have been fierce -- and they have come as something of a surprise for people who believed the land had been stabilized. Two weeks ago, Herb Homsher pulled his car over by the side of the road in the midst of a dust storm near the Colorado-Oklahoma border. It was the kind of duster Mr. Homsher had not experienced in years. ''You couldn't see the end of your car,'' he said. In Montana, heavy dust this year caused a similar brownout, resulting in a traffic pileup that killed two television reporters. According to the latest assessment by federal officials, half of Montana, all of Wyoming, nearly two-thirds of Colorado, half of Kansas, a third of Texas and most of New Mexico are in the midst of a drought labeled severe to extreme. Wildfires are racing through the eastern front of Colorado. With 280 fires already this year, Colorado has had four times as many fires as normal. On much of the High Plains, the prairie grass was long ago plowed under to grow dry land wheat, a grain that depends entirely on what falls from the sky, with no help from irrigation. ''My father was born in 1918 and all my life he's been talking about how we should be careful, we could have another 1930's,'' said Lochiel Edwards, a wheat farmer from near Havre, Mont. ''Well, now it's as dire as I've seen in my life, and my father just the other day said it's as bad as 1936.'' The aridity may be worse than it was in the 1930's, but the dust storms do not compare. Up to 10 million acres lost at least the upper five inches of topsoil in those years, according to federal surveys. During one storm in 1934, more than 350 tons of airborne dust was galloping across the prairie. Wheat was never replanted on much of the land, which was reseeded with native prairie grass. Now the government pays thousands of farmers to keep the ground untilled, as part of the conservation reserve program. Without the last half-century of federally directed soil conservation, much of the old Dust Bowl would be windblown again, many officials and farmers say. Even so, Mr. Edwards said, many of his neighbors have lost topsoil to the new dust storms. ''Their land has gotten away from them, and I don't think it's their fault,'' he said. ''This drought is just a killer.'' To counties already hit by declining population and depressed farm prices, the days without rain are just one more piece of bad luck. In much of eastern Montana, Wyoming and Colorado, less than an inch of rain has fallen since last June. The soil is dry down to two feet in some areas. ''It's a cumulative thing,'' Mr. Aber of Montana's task force said. ''Four years without much rain at all. Even during the 30's, there were some fairly normal rainfall years, so this is almost unprecedented.'' Bridges cross over dry beds labeled rivers. Fields that usually turn green with the first spring rains are as brown as the skin of a baked potato. Rivers that drain snowmelt from the Rockies and flow east -- like the Platte and the Arkansas -- are running thin, and are so overtaxed that in some places only people with water rights dating to the 19th century are likely to get their regular share. Some small towns, like Melstone, Mont., have lost their municipal water supplies, the first time anyone can remember this happening. River rafting companies on the Front Range, where the prairie meets the mountains, talk about ''what water'' instead of white water. Fishing guides worry that the winter's snow will not bring nearly enough water to make for a successful year on the region's trout streams. ''Everyone knows it's dry here, but it is the extreme, prolonged dry times that makes this such a disaster,'' said Jeff Tranel, an agronomist with Colorado State University. Prowers County, where Lamar is, is already a federal disaster area, making farmers eligible for subsidized loans because of the weather. This week, Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado asked the federal government to declare the entire state a disaster area. But few people want to take on more debt. ''We're in trouble,'' said Steve Wertz, who has 3,000 acres in wheat and corn near this town on the old Santa Fe wagon trail. ''I've been farming for 25 years and never seen it like this.'' The quirks of global agriculture are such that even though dry land wheat, the crop that first brought white settlers here to break the prairie sod, is in trouble, grain prices remain depressed because of a worldwide glut. Senators from the region are pressing for $2.4 billion in disaster payments for farmers who will not be able to grow a crop this year. But with so many subsidies already directed at failing agricultural operations, a new payment for drought-related losses faces stiff opposition in Congress. Looking to the white sky, farmers shrug and wonder if a new Dust Bowl will soon be upon them. ''The attitude out here is bad,'' said Mr. Edwards, the third-generation Montana wheat farmer. ''It's just a depressing time to be on the prairie.'' A joke making the rounds has it that the ducks who live in the cotton-mouthed counties in eastern Montana have yet to learn to swim. Most people say the line with a straight face."
"IT may be hard to comprehend the drought on land surrounded by water, but Ken Druse and Louis Bauer are facing the same restrictions in their garden this spring as everyone else in New Jersey. The Paulinskill River rushes by their two-and-a-half-acre island, about 50 miles northwest of Manhattan. The two men have a well 300 feet deep. But even so, they must restrict lawn watering to certain days and times. And if the drought worsens and restrictions are tightened, they may be able to water their extensive plantings only with a hand-held hose or a drip irrigation system. No matter. They never water their lawn anyway. And their sun-loving, drought-tolerant plants thrive in a gravel garden that needs no water. Plants that do crave drink are supplied with buried soaker hoses. ''Laziness is the mother of invention,'' said Mr. Druse, the garden writer and photographer, standing by a 75-foot-long border where he laid 500 feet of flexible soaker hoses made out of recycled rubber tires. ''Who wants to stand out here all day holding a hose? All I do now is turn a valve.'' Though about five inches of rain have fallen in the past month, their home county, Sussex, is still about 13 inches below normal annual rainfall. Five summers of drought in six years have schooled these gardeners in survival tactics. The gravel garden, in these circumstances, seems a godsend, but it really came about, like many good ideas, from a convergence of events. One was all the rocks poking out of the soil. Another was a neighbor, Chris Hagler, who wanted to build a stone wall at their place. Still another was Mr. Druse's love of Mediterranean plants. All the heat-loving, sun-gulping sedums, verbascums, lavenders and thymes that wouldn't, if they had their druthers, be caught dead in this shady -- and usually rainy -- part of the world. ''I wanted tomatoes,'' Mr. Druse said. ''And we don't get enough sun for a day lily.'' Gardeners will do almost anything to grow what they can't have. Mr. Druse and Mr. Bauer, a curator at Wave Hill, the public garden in the Bronx, dug up the sunniest part of their land -- an old clay-filled nursery bed that gets about five hours of sun -- and rototilled four inches of gravel into it. They made a gravel path. Then Mr. Hagler started building a 72-foot-long wall shaped like a reversed question mark. ''I made a model of the whole garden, so Chris could refer to it when we weren't around,'' said Mr. Druse, who graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design. Mr. Bauer hauled rocks; Mr. Hagler set them in place; Mr. Druse planted seeds and seedlings in loam-filled tube socks nestled into holes in the wall. It is one of those bizarre ideas that come to plant maniacs. ''I would tie the ankle part, and fill it with soil so I had this sausage about two feet long, and poke a hole in the toe for the seedling,'' Mr. Druse said. His theory was that drought-tolerant plants develop long root systems, and a long tube of good soil would give them a head start. It worked. The wall is flourishing with campanula, which will be covered soon in blue flowers, as well as blue Phlox subulata, white bleeding heart and alpine plants like dianthus, rock jasmine and Primula auricula. Mr. Druse is the author of five popular garden books, including the award-winning ''Making More Plants: The Science, Art and Joy of Propagation'' (Clarkson Potter, 2000). Mr. Bauer is the curator of Wave Hill's perennial garden. Seven years ago, when they found this island in the river, with its humble 150-year-old shack, they started planting madly: sugar maples, weeping katsura trees, a peach tree started from seed, Japanese maples, hydrangeas, redbud trees, primroses, jack-in-the-pulpits, gingers, thousands of perennials and bulbs. Mr. Druse, 52, gardened on a SoHo roof for 10 years, then in a Brooklyn backyard for 15 more. In his late 40's, he started longing for the watery woodlands of his youth in Plainfield, N.J. ''I came here for the water,'' he said. ''Normally, we get 49 inches of water a year.'' The worst was 1999, when the wooded hills turned brown. All the leaves on the trees died. The two men watched their shallow-rooted hemlock fall over, dead. It is water, of course, that has made the American garden homogenous, allowing lawns and impatiens to grow in the desert. ''If we couldn't water, things would look different,'' Mr. Druse said. ''Water is what makes places look the same.'' Under drought conditions, gardeners have to pay attention to what survives. Surprisingly, it is not always the natives. Old garden plants, like lilacs, which hail from Asia and southern Europe, and European bearded irises, which go dormant in summer, evolved in hot, dry climates. Tulips are another good bedding plant, because they bloom in the spring, and pack it in by the drier month of June. The structure of plants provides hints to their drought tolerance. ''Anything with needles or narrow leaves can retain water,'' Mr. Druse said. ''Or leaves with tiny hairs or powdery surfaces.'' Tuberous or fleshy-rooted plants (like irises, jack-in-the-pulpits and sedums) can store water and nutrients for long dry spells. ''Once established, arisaemas or jack-in-the-pulpits are incredibly tolerant,'' Mr. Druse said. ''Sometimes, if it's dry, they won't come up. They'll just skip a year and come up the next.'' On the other hand, plants with big wide leaves are made to soak up what little sun falls through the forest. They crave water. So bye-bye hostas and elephant ears. As natural as the Druse-Bauer garden appears, with its layers of trees and shrubs, many plants -- like hydrangeas, lady's mantle, roses and peach trees -- could not survive without soaker hoses sweating droplets of water to their root zones. Plenty of compost helps the sandy soil retain moisture, as do polymer crystals, like Soil Moist. But there's no substitute for water. Mr. Druse showed off the black plastic pipe, 1 1/2 inches in diameter, that runs 300 feet along the western edge of his garden, drawing water from a tank in the cellar that is connected to the well. He bought the pipe at a plumbing supply store, then connected soaker hoses to snake through the woodland garden and his long mixed border. ''I had to lift some of the plants,'' he said. ''But I tried to lay the hoses about 15 inches apart.'' Lay the hoses more closely together in extremely sandy soil, farther apart in soil with more clay. Adjusting the water pressure was trial and error. ''You just want the hoses to sweat,'' he said. ''And to water as much at the end as the beginning.'' He drains the big feeder line at the end of the season. The soaker hoses, buried away from ultraviolet light, should last for years, he said. Mr. Druse doesn't know how much water this system saves in comparison with a standard sprinkler system. But a drip system, experts say, uses 50 to 70 percent less than a sprinkler or even a hand-held hose. No water is wasted in evaporation, and plants are less stressed than with top-watering because the water goes right to the roots. So unless Mr. Druse has to turn off the faucet altogether, his crescent border will be full of roses, like Buff Beauty, a fragrant hybrid musk the color of ripe apricots, and Sally Holmes, a creamy climber with muted orange buds that likes to wind through the peach tree. The 100-year-old Japanese maple will have enough to drink, and so will the viburnums, the smokebushes and old Spiraea prunifolia arching over Pan, a bust Mr. Druse made himself. His woodland garden, playfully divided between North America and Asia, is home to plant families that show up on both continents. North American jack-in-the-pulpits grow across the path from 12 Asian counterparts, an American snake-bark maple waves at an Asian striped maple named White Tigress. There are gingers, bleeding hearts and geraniums from both sides of the world. These perennials and trees were able to develop healthy root systems, thanks to a water tank Mr. Druse rigged up. ''I took a 55-gallon plastic drum and stuck it on a little five-foot tower to increase the water pressure,'' he said. ''I'd fill it up and the water would seep out through soaker hoses all week.'' He stained the electric blue drum with a dirt-brown Cabot stain, which makes the tank almost invisible in the woodland. ''I use it on everything,'' he said. ''I call it invisible stain.'' This land has survived drought before, and it will again. Just how well the plants will do depends upon the ancient art of the gardeners. Add 20 Tons of Gravel; Mix Well IN a dry season, gardeners can step up the compost and lay out a network of soaker hoses. But they can also imitate Ken Druse's gravel garden, and start plants that will thrive in low moisture while still providing great beauty. His gravel garden is host to chartreuse and purple euphorbias, blue-green and gray lavenders, verbascums, thymes, alliums, a heat-loving rose called Ballerina, and a cute little yellow and white rose called Popcorn. Mr. Druse's favorite tulip, Prinses Irene, a soft orange Triumph flamed with purple and hints of green, has just finished blooming. Hardy cyclamens are spreading happily at the base of the stone wall. ''Things love to sprout in gravel,'' Mr. Druse said. ''There's less competition, water collects in the crevices, the stones are a heat trap.'' Iris pallida Aurea Variegata, whose gray and yellow leaves are so handsome, is partial to the heat-collecting stones. So are the yarrow and lamb's ears. Many of these plants are available at specialty nurseries. The gravel, or three-eighths-inch crushed stone, was $17 a ton at a construction supply yard. The garden required 20 tons, or 15 cubic yards. About 40 different sempervivums thrive there, all those rosy purple and green hens-and-chicks your grandmother loved. And tiny green sedums ramble over the rocks. Kenilworth ivy, a pretty weed that grows only where it wants to grow, has taken up residence, covering itself with miniature orchid-shape purple blooms. ''When the fruit ripens, the vine elongates and pushes the seed into the wall,'' Mr. Druse said. ''Every plant has a story.'' Once plants are established, this garden never gets watered. Polymer crystals, mixed in water, give new plants a leg up, because they hold water long after it would normally drain away. Here, too, Mr. Druse is training lilacs to form a tunnel that will be entered through a gate made from an antique headboard, painted white. (Lilacs, remember, are tolerant of drought.) Most are old French lilacs, including Mr. Lincoln, a very tall, very lanky and very fragrant blue. ''It would be a wonderful lilac to plant under a second-story window,'' Mr. Druse said. And chances are, it will survive many droughts to come. ANNE RAVER NATURE"
"Rain and snow, rare visitors to drought-stricken Colorado, tamed a scorching wildfire today in the Pike National Forest, but did little to quell apprehension about the effects of severe drought here and in many parts of the West this summer. ''Something like this helps, but it's a drop in the bucket,'' said Makoto Moore, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service who was assigned to the team managing the firefighting here in the depths of the million-acre forest. ''We need a prolonged period of cool and wet weather.'' If the past few months are any indication, such relief does not seem likely soon. What little snow there was on the state's many mountain peaks melted this winter two months ahead of schedule, leaving reservoirs and waterways -- including the Colorado River -- at depths far lower than usual. Coupled with an almost total lack of rain, the shortfall has forced cities, counties and communities to restrict water use, worried whether their reserves will hold out. With water for irrigation at a premium, ranchers have begun to auction off livestock to owners of more bountiful pasturelands elsewhere. Recreational fishing, a bastion of Colorado's economy, is headed for a severe downturn as aquatic habitats become gradually sparser. At least 35 of Colorado's 64 counties have issued outdoor fire bans, in what may be the state's worst drought in 60 years. Elsewhere, the situation is no better. Wyoming, California, Utah and Montana, as well as Colorado, need more than seven inches of rain to end the drought, experts estimate. The lack of rain has drastically affected wheat-growing areas of Kansas and Nebraska, and there is none in the forecast. Dust storms that caused the deaths of two motorists in Lincoln, Neb., on Wednesday prompted officials there to advise drivers to stay off highways on windy days. On Thursday, livestock farmers urged the Senate Agriculture Committee to provide $500 million in disaster assistance to drought-stricken areas. In New Mexico, a forest fire that has burned more than 4,000 acres in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains north of Santa Fe continued to rage today. Major fires have also hit Arizona. ''The effects of the drought have been more drastic than I originally thought,'' said Ned Williams, utilities director for Boulder. Its City Council on Tuesday ordered, among other things, that lawns be watered no more than twice a week, and no more than 15 minutes in one spot. Violators face fines or jail. One of the city's public pools will remain closed for the summer. ''The drought is real and the quantity of our water supply is fixed and limited, and has never been at this low a level,'' Mr. Williams told the council. In Lafayette, 10 miles east of Boulder, residents may not use a hose to wash cars, and pools may be filled only with the city's permission. In the 31 parks of the Denver Mountain Parks system, officials have banned everything that produces an open flame, like smoking, campfires, fireworks and welding torches. In Denver itself, officials have recommended limits on water use but have not made them mandatory. It is in the threat of fires that the drought reveals its greatest impact. Even as the Pike forest fire here, 60 miles southwest of Denver, weakened this morning, two new wildfires sprang to life west of Colorado Springs -- one of them caused by a power line felled by snow and wind. ''The moisture that we've gotten hasn't been around long enough to relieve the fire danger,'' said Richard Homann, fire division supervisor for the Colorado Forest Service. ''We're seeing much more fire activity than in previous years. It's even ahead of the 2000 fire season, which was bad throughout the West. If we keep on the same pace, it will be one of the top five fire seasons in Colorado.'' Colorado's fire season, which usually begins in mid-June, sprang to life on April 23, when the so-called Snaking Fire burned 3,000 acres northwest of Bailey. On May 5, the Black Mountain Fire near Evergreen forced the evacuation of 1,700 homes. This week, two major fires erupted near Nucla and Durango. Even the relatively dense rainfall here overnight -- and snowfall at higher elevations -- failed to satisfy fire officials, who ordered more than 600 firefighters from a half-dozen states back to work this morning on the steep slopes of the Pike Forest. The fire, which officials said they believed was sparked by lightning, flared up on Tuesday near Schoonover Gulch and within hours forced the evacuation of at least 60 people, including a group of youngsters at a Y.M.C.A. camp at which several buildings were later destroyed. Altogether, about a dozen structures burned by Thursday afternoon, when the fire had cut across some 4,000 acres. The flames came to within one-third of a mile of Deckers, an unincorporated town made up of a handful of buildings surrounded by Ponderosa pines, Douglas firs and juniper trees. In the wake of the fire, whole hills lay in a ghostly gray haze, the ground and the trees stripped of color and life. Along Highway 67, closed to normal traffic, the Horse Creek Cafe and Saloon survived, unlike the hills beyond it. On a dirt road leading to the Y.M.C.A. camp, all that remained of two burned vacation houses were their chimneys. At the camp, Shady Brook Ranch, a garage and two cabins were obliterated. Nearby, a crew of firefighters marched toward the hills, while a tanker truck pumped water from a pond where the children's canoes bobbed by a dock. ''It was pretty touch-and-go there for a while,'' said Bill Krausser, a contractor whose property at Trail Creek, 15 miles south of Deckers, was within sight of the fire on Wednesday night. Mr. Krausser said he got his two horses ready for loading into a trailer, and waited for the worst. As he watched, a black bear came thundering through the property, southbound. ''He was beating feet, heading away from the fire,'' Mr. Krausser recalled. ''Animals are smarter than people, sometimes.''"
"It is spring, but the flowers that typically grace the tree beds and vest-pocket parks of the East Side have not sprung. The thirsty blossoms that used to roll through the neighborhood this time of year have been relegated to a damper past. New York City has been in a Stage I drought emergency since April 1, and as a result people may water trees and flowers only with hand-held watering containers or low-pressure hoses, and lawn watering is restricted to certain hours. As a result, some groups have decided to forgo spring planting. The East 60's Property Owners Association, which has been planting impatiens in 63 tree beds along 61st and 62nd Streets each May for two decades, will stick to drought-friendly ivy this year. ''It's unfortunate,'' said Susan Lek, the association president. ''Hopefully people will still respect the tree as plant material and will keep their dogs out of the tree beds.'' Thomas Ching, who manages East Side parks for the Department of Parks and Recreation, praised the decision. ''Those are little water guzzlers,'' he said of impatiens. ''If they die and shrivel to a crisp, that's a pretty expensive way to add organic matter to your tree beds.'' The Carl Schurz Park Association responded to the drought by postponing a $50,000 landscaping project until the fall. The grass near Gracie Mansion will remain uncut, as close-cropped lawns require more water than wild ones. Total sacrifice may be unnecessary. ''Done within reason, it is O.K. to plant small numbers of annuals,'' said Adrian Benepe, the parks commissioner. At Carl Schurz Park, gardeners have planted a drought-friendly spread of tubers, purple allium, flowering onion plants, cat mint and chartreuse English yew. Sutton Place Park, on East 54th Street and Sutton Place, is a good testing ground for drought-friendly horticulture. Swimming in a sea of overheated asphalt and besieged by exhaust from traffic on the F.D.R. Drive, the park requires extreme gardening. Constance Casey, an assistant gardener with the Parks Department, has added lots of organic matter to the soil. This material acts like a sponge, soaking up water and slowly releasing it as the soil dries. Mulching is important. Ms. Casey has put a biodegradable cotton-weed cloth beneath a thick layer of wood chips, both of which help prevent evaporation and fend off weeds, which compete for water. Finally, she chose plants with low water needs, like lavender, sage, thistle, dusty miller, purple verbena, white ruffled petunias and carefree wonder roses. ''She's a little showy and a tiny bit tasteless,'' Ms. Casey said as she pointed to a tawdry pink rose. ''But we like her, and hope she will be carefree.'' ERIKA KINETZ NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: UPPER EAST SIDE"
"This should be the so-called monsoon season here, when moist Pacific air brings afternoon thundershowers. But only a trace of rain has fallen since Arizona's devastating wildfires were finally contained last week, providing little relief from a statewide drought now entering a fourth year. The lack of rain and snow has depleted ponds and reservoirs, parched ground cover, killed herds of livestock and cost hundreds of millions of dollars in agricultural revenue. The Bush administration recently declared Arizona a drought disaster area, making many farmers and ranchers eligible for low-interest loans and other aid. ''People out in the fields and people in the high country all tell me the same thing,'' said Ken Evans, president of the Arizona Farm Bureau, an organization of 15,000 members. ''This is the worst drought in Arizona since the white man came here,'' hundreds of years ago. But in a desert state that relies on its federally mandated water allotment from the Colorado River to support its rapid growth, a drought does not mean water shortages everywhere. While ranchers in many areas are selling thousands of animals to prevent death by dehydration and some rural counties are having water trucked in, residents of Phoenix and Tucson, the state's largest cities, are free to wash their cars, soak their lawns and fill their swimming pools. Indeed, only a few communities, like Flagstaff and Pine, have any water restrictions. Most everywhere else, water parks are open and new residential and golf course developments are forging ahead on schedule. Irrigation flows uninterrupted to alfalfa, citrus, cotton and vegetable crops in Yuma County and elsewhere. In fact, these are boom times for alfalfa growers -- with grazing lands parched, cattle ranchers have been forced to buy stockpiles of feed for their hungry animals. The reason for such disparity is the way water is delivered. The largest source is the Colorado River, which supplies Phoenix and other communities as well as farmers. Other places draw from less reliable sources -- ground water, which is available everywhere in varying amounts, and lakes and reservoirs. The steady flow of the Colorado, which also supplies water to six other states and Mexico through contracts first negotiated in 1922, virtually assures Phoenix and Tucson all the water they need. Those two cities get 53 percent of the Colorado River water flowing into the state. Developers say abundant water in metropolitan Phoenix is a major reason Arizona has become one of the fastest-growing states. ''In the 1960's, 80 percent of water in the state was used for agriculture, and 20 percent for residents and businesses,'' said John Sullivan, a senior official with the Salt River Project, which manages water into the Phoenix area from the Salt and Verde Rivers. ''Now, it's 80-20 the other way. Water is there for growth.'' Environmentalists argue that such a strategy might only prolong droughts. ''The development industry is not inclined to educate citizens about water conservation because it actually doesn't use all the allotment it has and worries that if it doesn't use it now, it won't have it in the future,'' said David Hogan, spokesman for the Center for Biological Diversity, a Tucson environmental group. For Mr. Hogan, and free-market conservatives, the subsidized water used by farmers is more offensive, especially for cotton, which he called ''grossly water intensive, especially for a crop that receives massive subsidies in other parts of the country.'' Stephen Moore, president of the Club for Growth, a pro-market political action committee in Washington, said removal of subsidies, allowing the price of water to rise, would eliminate shortages and be ''the best way to encourage conservation.'' In any case, conservationists say officials in drought-prone states are doing too little to prevent shortages. Lisa Force, program director for Living Rivers, a Western nonprofit group that works to restore waterways, said recent low-rainfall years in the Southwest may now be the norm, not aberrations, and states need to adapt. Arizona officials, she said, ''totally have their heads buried in the sand.'' In neighboring New Mexico, for example, which is entitled to only a small share of water from the Colorado River projects, water restrictions are widespread. For now, Arizona officials say any argument over surplus and need cannot be resolved by the current water network. Don Lavelle, a spokesman for the State Department of Water Resources, said even if there were restrictions in Phoenix and other cities, the water saved could not be diverted to other arid areas, because no canals or pipelines have been built to reach them. Droughts will always harm areas that depend more on ground water and runoff, he said. That is the case now, with rainfall at 10 percent of normal statewide and lakes and reservoirs well below 30-year averages. ''Some towns are always on the edge with water problems because of their location,'' Mr. Lavelle said, describing conditions that are even worse across the northern tier of Arizona, where underground geologic fractures make water tables less dependable even in the best of times. Those areas have been affected the most by drought, the brunt of it borne by cattle ranchers, who make up about 40 percent of the state's annual $6 billion to $7 billion agriculture industry. As grazing lands dry up, cattlemen are selling animals to out-of-state buyers or surrendering them to slaughterhouses at bargain prices. A recent survey by the Arizona Cattlemen's Association found that the drought depleted the cattle stock over all by about 20 percent since 1996, a loss of about 60,000 animals. State officials predict that an additional 47,000 animals will be lost this year. As residents of northeast Arizona, Navajo Indians have also been hurt by the drought. Alex DiNatale, the Navajo Nation hydrologist, said most of the reservation's 7,500 ponds have dried up, deep-water aquifers are empty and as many as 10,000 animals have died this year from dehydration, malnutrition and auto accidents that occur when animals eat roadside plants. Navajos have begun selling animals to auction houses. One sheep, Mr. DiNatale said, might normally sell for $85, but some herders are selling sheep now for $7.50. ''And that's a good option,'' he said. Wildlife is suffering, too. Brian Wakeling, the big game management supervisor for the state Department of Game and Fish, said alarming numbers of wildlife are unable to survive the first few months of life. Survival rates for prong-horned antelope, normally up to 40 percent of those born, are under 10 percent in some parts of the state. The rate for elk, normally 40 to 50 percent, has fallen below 20 percent. A land-management group, the Diablo Trust, has begun hauling hundreds of thousands of gallons of water into areas around Flagstaff to save as many animals as possible. ''We've never seen anything like this,'' said Mandy Metzger, the trust's director. ''Every time we dump a load of water, 100 to 200 elk show up. It's a tinderbox out there.'' Correction: July 16, 2002, Tuesday An article on Sunday about drought in Arizona misstated the given name of a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, who said the areas suffering worst were those not served by aqueducts supplying Colorado River water. He is Jack Lavelle, not Don."
"The Guadalupe River has receded here, its fury abated. The devastating flooding this month washed away riverfront homes like bobbing corks and left this central Texas city's tourist economy so crippled that officials have begun an emergency advertising campaign. ''New Braunfels,'' a proposed advertisement says. ''It's still there.'' Yet the breadth and power of the flooding, the spectacle of that roiling brown water, have temporarily obscured a problem: in normal times, the Guadalupe may not have enough water to meet the demands of one of the nation's fastest-growing regions. This finite supply has prompted one of the most unusual water wars in the country. While cities, farmers and industry routinely file applications to pump water from rivers like the Guadalupe, a small Texas environmental group is seeking a permit to ensure that hundreds of billions of gallons of water are allowed to flow untouched to the Gulf of Mexico. Environmentalists say the step is necessary to maintain the health of the Guadalupe and the estuary at its mouth. They cite problems that poor planning and poor management have wrought on the Everglades and on the Rio Grande. But others say the proposal would wreak havoc on a region desperate for drinking water by eliminating a vital source that is not threatened. ''It's a very interesting, very classic water battle,'' said W. E. West Jr., general manager of the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority, which opposes the permit. The Guadalupe meanders about 300 miles, from the Hill Country to the San Antonio Bay at the Gulf of Mexico. The Hill Country is semi-arid and susceptible to drought, but the rocky terrain makes the region vulnerable to flash flooding in rare downpours. After heavy rains this month, the normally placid Guadalupe turned into a violent waterway. Here in New Braunfels, Michael Meek, president of the chamber of commerce, was fretting on July 3 that the drought might threaten the peak season of the city's $200 million tourist industry. Thousands were expected for Fourth of July inner-tube rides down the Guadalupe. Mr. Meek got so many calls that he issued a news release promising that the Guadalupe would be ''toobable.'' Little did he know. ''It's either feast or famine,'' he said of the recent flood-or-drought existence along the Guadalupe. A 1998 flood followed similar spasms of flash flooding. The longer dry periods drive the dispute over the Guadalupe. New Braunfels, San Marcos and Victoria draw drinking water from the river. A regional water plan calls for pumping billions of gallons of water from the mouth of the Guadalupe to San Antonio. Yet many environmentalists worry that such stress on the river will reduce its flow and irreversibly damage the estuary. The estuary, the breeding ground for shrimp, oysters and red snapper, as well as the winter home for the endangered whooping crane, depends on an influx of fresh water. ''We could see water rights being handed out right and left,'' said Dianne Wassenich, executive director of the San Marcos River Foundation, the group seeking the water permit. ''We were concerned that there wouldn't be any water left.'' Ms. Wassenich's group applied in July 2000 for a water right on the Guadalupe. Its application asked that 1.15 million acre feet of water be left in the river, a figure based on a state wildlife study to determine how much water was needed to maintain the estuary. An acre foot of water is the amount needed to cover an acre to a depth of a foot, or 325,851 gallons. The timing of the application was significant. In Texas, water rights are assigned in chronological order, meaning that during droughts, those with the oldest permits are first. The San Marcos application preceded the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority's proposal to pump water to San Antonio. The San Marcos application quickly attracted national attention. This year, the American Rivers Foundation named the Guadalupe one of the 10 most endangered rivers in the nation because of potential pumping demands. Western environmental groups have increasingly sought water rights as a way to protect rivers. Mr. West, of the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority, portrayed the application as an effort to stop growth and development in central Texas. Population in the region is expected to double by 2050, and the water supply, particularly in San Antonio, is a leading political issue. Mr. West said the San Marcos application would undercut a water plan approved by the State Legislature. ''It's a classic situation of growth versus nongrowth,'' he said. He contends that the San Marcos application seeks to keep too much water ''in stream,'' leaving little for other uses. ''That magnitude of water for bays and estuaries will simply prevent moving water to San Antonio.'' A decision on the permit application will be made by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. Cities like New Braunfels oppose the San Marcos application, saying it does not fairly share the resource. Several wildlife and sportsmen groups and some residents of tiny fishing villages on the estuary support the application. The Legislature, which will meet in 2003, will probably address the issue. Dr. Larry McKinney, senior director of aquatic resources for the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife, said the San Marcos application had focused public attention on the long-term health of the river. A disputed question is how much water is available on the Guadalupe. Dr. McKinney pointed to a study that suggested there might be enough for all. ''My question to both sides is, What are we fighting about?'' he said. ''Why can't we figure out some plan to preserve enough water for the ecological health of the river and the bay and meet the growing needs of cities like San Antonio?''"
"Despite driving rains that dumped more than two inches of rain over the New York metropolitan region late last week and helped push reservoir levels closer to normal, a drought emergency and restrictions on water use in New York City and in New Jersey will remain in effect, officials said yesterday. The reservoirs in the 2,000-square-mile watershed that supplies more than nine million people in New York City and four surrounding counties were 86 percent full yesterday, city environmental officials said, up from 50 percent of capacity in late March. At this time of year, reservoirs are typically 99 percent full, but because the average rainfall over the past few months was well below normal across the region, they did not reach that level, and officials will keep in place a series of restrictions on the use of water. The New York City restrictions, similar to those in New Jersey, include prohibiting people from washing their cars with a hose, limiting the days and hours people can water their lawns, banning people from hosing down sidewalks and driveways, and requiring restaurants to serve water only on request. The city has issued 3,000 summonses in the five boroughs for violations of those restrictions since the drought emergency went into effect on April 1, said Natalie Millner, a spokeswoman for the City Department of Environmental Protection, with fines ranging from $100 to $1,000. Before receiving a summons, anyone found to be violating the restrictions is supposed to receive a verbal warning. Department inspectors have fanned out across the city to search for offenders: anyone ignoring a leak, filling a dry fountain or reflecting pool, opening a fire hydrant, watering a lawn for more than four hours every other day, or committing other water-use violations. (In New York City, car washing is permitted if a bucket, not a hose, is used, while in New Jersey, cars can be washed only at commercial car washes.) In late March, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg declared the first drought emergency in New York City since 1989. And officials say the factors that led to the drought -- beginning with a lack of rain in the fall and compounded by an unusually warm and dry winter -- may not be overcome for quite some time. ''The perception is that we're O.K., but we are not,'' Ms. Millner said yesterday. Of particular concern to environmental officials is that summer brings both heavy water consumption and a more scattered kind of rainfall, which, even during heavy thunderstorms, may not drench the ground in the places where it is most needed. For example, Ms. Millner said, during the storms of last Thursday and Friday, the city received up to two and a half inches of rainfall in some places, but the reservoirs, which are in the Catskills, received less than half that. ''There are a lot of variables that go into what makes up this particular drought emergency,'' Ms. Millner said. ''We are very concerned and have to maintain the strict regulations until we get through this very heavy usage period of summer and see, in fact, what kind of precipitation we do get'' through fall. Outside the city, conditions improved enough over the past few months to persuade New York State environmental officials to lift their drought watch -- the least serious level of drought advisory -- for 17 counties in upstate New York, and their drought warning, which calls for voluntary conservation measures, for seven counties. Drought warnings are still in effect for 13 counties in southeastern New York -- Delaware, Dutchess, Greene, Nassau, Orange, Otsego, Putnam, Rockland, Schoharie, Suffolk, Sullivan, Ulster and Westchester -- and the five boroughs of New York City, officials said yesterday. And in four New York counties, Putnam, Westchester, Ulster and Orange, the city's drought emergency and water consumption restrictions apply because those counties are served by the city's watershed. In Connecticut, officials have also asked residents to reduce their water consumption voluntarily but have not imposed restrictions. In New Jersey, a statewide drought emergency remains in effect, although a regulation banning people from watering lawns was amended earlier this month to allow watering on alternate days. Officials at the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection could not be reached yesterday, but the department's Web site, which posts regular updates on the drought situation, said the drought emergency there continued despite slowly rising reservoir levels."
"Thanks to spring rainfall that largely replenished reservoirs in New Jersey, and to lobbying by the golf and landscaping industries, the state's Department of Environmental Protection yesterday eased several restrictions on water use that were imposed on March 11 under a drought emergency. Lawn and plant watering is allowed on an odd-even basis by address, and new sod and newly seeded lawns may be watered every day. Residents may wash their cars at home on Saturday or Sunday, if they use a bucket or an automatic shut-off hose. Golf courses may increase water consumption to 80 percent of normally permitted levels, up from 50 percent. Following a particularly arid fall and winter, rainfall in March, April and May was at or above normal levels, the department said. For example, average levels in the state's northeast water supply region were at 92.1 percent of capacity, compared with a seasonal average of 91.1 percent, while levels in the New Jersey Water Supply Authority region, in the central part of the state, were at 90.3 percent of capacity, versus their 94.9 percent average. Groundwater supplies in southern New Jersey remained low, but had improved. Some restrictions will remain in place. The drought emergency has not been officially lifted, and state officials yesterday urged New Jersey residents to continue voluntary conservation."
"A regional drought that is the worst on record is taking a heavy toll in the Carolinas, where some of the country's fastest-growing cities and suburbs are proving unexpectedly vulnerable to water shortages. Over the last four years, North and South Carolina have come up short by the equivalent of a year's supply of rain, and now cities like Charlotte and Raleigh, N.C., as well as dozens of smaller towns, are paying the price in the form of mandatory restrictions intended to reduce water use by as much as 20 percent. The water shortages, so severe that one parched North Carolina town has had to borrow water by fire hose, have been driven most directly by abnormalities in the climate, among the most severe in a drought that is now affecting more than a third of the United States, water experts and city planners say. But those abnormalities have been compounded by sprawling growth, which has sent water use spiraling ahead even of population increases and has cut into supplies of water that would have otherwise recharged aquifers, rivers and streams. In Charlotte, for example, the number of water users served by the local utility has increased 36 percent since 1992. But average daily water use has increased 56 percent, shrinking the cushion that planners had expected might prevent water rationing in rain-scarce years. Now, with accumulated rainfall since 1998 running more than 40 inches below normal, water managers in the region say the lesson of the drought is that more must be done sooner to promote conservation, even in normally rain-kissed climates like that of North Carolina, which averages 40 inches a year. ''As we grow, we need to manage our water supplies more carefully,'' said John N. Morris, director of North Carolina's division of water resources. In a study released today, three national environmental organizations called attention to the connection between suburban development and water shortages. It said new roads, parking lots and other paved surfaces surrounding cities like Charlotte and Atlanta might be preventing millions of gallons of water a day from seeping naturally into municipal water supplies that were already facing higher demand as a result of rapid growth. ''An essential and costly resource is being squandered at an alarming rate,'' said the study, by the Natural Resources Defense Council, American Rivers and Smart Growth America. In the Atlanta area alone, it estimated, the daily runoff from paved surfaces built in the last 15 years may waste water that could otherwise sustain 3.5 million people. The report offered only rough, unsubstantiated estimates, and independent water experts cautioned that hydrology made it difficult to gauge the exact effect of development on natural water flows. But they said rapid growth was making more and more American communities prone to drought disruptions. ''Because of development, we're much more vulnerable than we've ever been,'' said Mark Svoboda, a climatologist at the National Drought Mitigation Center in Lincoln, Neb. ''And in part that's because you have more and more water going into sewer drains and less into the soil.'' While rain was falling in the Southeast today for the second day in a row, only the most immediate drought concerns have been eased. In North Carolina and southern Virginia, forecasts call for extreme drought to persist into the foreseeable future, and Duke Power, which operates the reservoirs that serve Charlotte and its neighbors, has warned that power plants and industries could be forced to shut down if water levels in reservoirs along the Catawba River continue to fall. The United States has been reducing its per capita consumption of water since 1980, thanks mostly to conservation by agriculture and industry. But among municipal water systems, overall water use increased 24 percent from 1980 to 1995, according to the most current government statistics, and in most cities it appears to be increasing faster than population growth. By any standard, the lack of rain is extreme, with more than a third of the country, including much of the West, listed by federal agencies as facing severe or extreme drought. Parts of 18 states have been declared federal disaster areas, and the drought mitigation center, an arm of the Agriculture Department, has said the dryness nationwide now ranks third, to the Dust Bowl years of the 1930's and to the early 1950's, in its severity. But while other areas, including western Nebraska and the Four Corners region of the Southwest, have also been particularly hard hit, climatologists like Mr. Svoboda say the impact may be greatest in the Carolinas, in part because the two states have had no relief from a drought that began in the summer of 1998. The past 12 months were the driest August through July in 123 years of recordkeeping in Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. Across most of the Carolinas, streams and rivers are flowing at 5 percent to 15 percent of normal. While lake and aquifer levels are near record lows, the pressure on those water supplies, in cities large and small, has been compounded by increasing summer demand, which experts say has been driven mostly by outdoor water use, as residents try to maintain green lawns around large suburban homes. In Raleigh, for example, water use in June set a daily record of 72 million gallons even after the local utility called for voluntary conservation, including not watering outdoors during daylight hours, and warned that the single reservoir on which the city depends was falling to unacceptably low levels. In response, Raleigh made restrictions mandatory, with a $500 penalty for violators. Most other communities in North and South Carolina, including Charlotte, have followed suit, in part because of a call by Gov. Michael F. Easley of North Carolina, for a 20 percent reduction in water use to stave off more serious problems. But so far, most towns have resisted anything more than bans on daytime watering, and few have achieved more than modest reductions in water use. In Raleigh, the reservoir level is 44 percent of normal, with enough water to last only 112 days. There and in Charlotte, city officials are considering further cutbacks, which could include limits on the water available to some businesses and industries. Until the drought, only Atlanta, among large cities in the Southeast, had been seen as facing a significant danger of water shortages. But with the extreme dry conditions now spreading into Virginia and Maryland, cities as far north as Baltimore are facing emergency water-use restrictions. Officials in Frederick, Md., where water supply has failed to keep pace with rapid population growth, say that without significant rainfall in the coming weeks, they may have to truck water into the city around the clock to provide for residents' basic needs. As measured by their footprints, Charlotte and Raleigh are among the country's fastest-growing communities, having added 74 percent and 95 percent, respectively, to their land areas from 1982 to 1997, a geographic sprawl more than double the rate of their rapid population growth. In both cities, officials said today that abundant rivers and rainfall should be more than enough to meet growing demand well into the future. If it were not for the drought, they said, the cities would not be facing water problems. ''There's ample room for demand to increase in the foreseeable future, except in exceptional drought years,'' said Vic Simpson, a spokesman for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Utilities, which serves Charlotte. They acknowledged, however, that they had been caught by surprise by the degree to which the demand for water has surged in recent years, and they said the drought and shortages were being seen as a warning to do more to bring water use in check. ''People are using more water than they used to, and it's something we need to keep a handle on,'' said Marti Gibson, environmental coordinator for the public utilities department in Raleigh."
"The groundskeepers at Fox Hopyard Golf Club in East Haddam, Conn., have started praying -- only partly in jest -- to a wooden rain-god statue the club superintendent brought back from Mexico. In South Jersey, farmers are shoveling mulch around their tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers to keep the last moisture in the soil from being sucked out by hot, dry winds. A plague of forest fires and dry conditions in the normally cool green woods of Adirondack State Park has led to a ban on campfires during the peak summer month for visitors. It looked as if the drought that scientists and government officials were warning about in March would lift during the weeks of near-normal rains in April and May. But in July the skies returned to their largely cloudless state and have camped over the Northeast since then, only to be joined by their cousin of sorts -- the record-breaking heat that has helped turn lawns brown, wilt trees and chase children and pets indoors for the last days of summer vacation. As temperatures around the New York region rose into the 90's yesterday for the fifth consecutive day, Leon Walenski, 55, a painting contractor from South Orange, N.J., had had enough. ''I can honestly say for the first time that I'm looking forward to winter,'' he said. All of New Jersey is locked in a drought emergency, while Long Island, New York City and its northern suburbs remain one notch below emergency status, in the drought warning category. Things could be worse, though. The region's reservoirs won back some of their normal volume during March and April, when rainfall was near normal and water-use regulations were eased in many places. New Jersey is still badly hit by the dry weather, however. With much of the state resting on porous, sandy soil, and without mountains to feed water to the rest of the state, officials say water-use rules that were eased in June may have to be tightened. ''We're looking at it day to day,'' said Bradley M. Campbell, the state's commissioner of environmental protection. But the wait to act does not imply that there is no problem. ''The message should be one of water conservation,'' said Elaine Makatura, a department spokeswoman. ''The water purveyors are aware of the severity and they are telling us that, looking in the short term, if we don't get rain we will have to act.'' The heat has also put a strain on the region's power supplies. In Connecticut, power officials barely averted setting a record for electricity use yesterday after Gov. John G. Rowland began the day by calling on residents and businesses to use power sparingly. The governor also reversed his stand against a Long Island Power Authority request, made on Wednesday, that the federal Department of Energy order the activation of a new transmission line under Long Island Sound that would carry power from New England to Long Island. Connecticut's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, contends that in six places the cable, which could serve Long Island and Connecticut, is not buried as deeply below the seabed as a state construction permit says it should be. Christopher Cooper, a spokesman for the governor, said that Mr. Rowland expected the company to meet the requirements of the permit, but that if federal officials declared an energy emergency, he would comply with the federal agency. So far, the most striking impact of the heat and drought has been visual. Grassy roadsides are khaki-colored, and the leaves on hardwood trees have begun to droop. Many rivers and creeks around the region have all but dried up. The driest period of the year is usually the first weeks of autumn, but many streams monitored by the United States Geological Survey are already almost too low to measure. The Stony Brook River, which runs through Princeton, N.J., would normally be flowing at a rate of 5.5 cubic feet per minute these days, but is barely managing 10 percent of that amount. And weather forecasts say that temperatures will remain in the 90's at least until Sunday evening, when thunderstorms are expected. ''In some cases we're setting a low record for water levels,'' said Tony Navoy, of the United States Geological Survey office in Trenton. Some tree experts said yesterday that hardwoods would probably shed their leaves early this year as a natural strategy to conserve water. Other effects of the drought may reveal themselves only when the storms come. ''Drier trees are going to be more brittle, and they are definitely more susceptible in heavy winds,'' said James M. Cramer of Top Notch Tree Experts in Martinsville, N.J. ''Everything has gotten really stressed out.'' Many golf course managers, who were among the loudest complainers when New Jersey imposed watering restrictions in the spring, say they are getting by with reduced sprinkling. And some golfers are even able to find a benefit in the dry weather, said Leslie VanSyckle, the pro at Rolling Greens Golf Club in Andover, N.J. The drought has kept pests in the soil to a minimum, he said, and some of the duffers playing concrete-hard fairways have gotten the notion that they are suddenly better players. ''You get a lot of roll out there,'' Ms. VanSyckle said. ''People actually think they're hitting the ball harder.'' Correction: August 21, 2002, Wednesday An article on Friday about water conditions in the metropolitan region misstated the level of drought declaration in effect for New York City. It is not a warning but a Stage 1 emergency -- one step higher, with more restrictions on water use. The article also misstated the standard unit of measurement for the flow in the Stony Brook River in New Jersey. The flow is one-tenth of the river's normal rate, which is 5.5 cubic feet per second, not per minute."
"Natural disasters usually come rife with drama. Hurricanes, tornadoes, forest fires, earthquakes -- all make for good headlines and even better visuals. But it would be hard to make a blockbuster movie about a heat wave. Heat waves come on subtly, raising summer temperatures just a little higher than normal and then receding. But they kill more people in the United States than all other natural disasters combined. The numbers are striking. According to the Center for Climatic Research at the University of Delaware, an average of 1,500 American city dwellers die each year because of the heat. Annual deaths from tornadoes, earthquakes and floods together total fewer than 200. The most deadly heat wave in recent years occurred in Chicago over a week in July 1995, when temperatures hovered around 100 degrees. Then, over 50,000 people were left without electricity, nearly two dozen hospitals closed their doors to new patients, ambulances lined up around the block waiting to drop off victims, and the county buried 68 people in a 160-foot-long trench. Though there was some argument over numbers, scientists now say that 739 people died that week. For context, the great Chicago fire of 1871 killed half that many. The San Francisco earthquake of 1989 killed 62, and Hurricane Andrew in 1992 killed 26. But even many of those who suffered through the 1995 heat wave failed to recognize its deadliness. ''When I interviewed Chicago residents, they usually remembered a death toll of about 100, and generally questioned whether the medical examiner had fabricated the figures or if the media had turned a nonevent into headline news,'' said Dr. Eric Klinenberg, a sociologist at New York University and the author of ''Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago.'' People find it hard to consider heat as a disaster for several reasons, Dr. Klinenberg says. First, heat waves cause little visible destruction. ''If a tornado touches down, the moment it hits, you can assess the damage,'' he said. With heat, at worst, roads buckle, trains derail and livestock die. Then there is the type of people heat waves kill. ''When there's a hurricane coming and there's valuable coastal property at risk, the whole world goes to watch,'' Dr. Klinenberg said. But in Chicago, as in other heat waves, the victims were ''the poor, the old, residents of abandoned and violent neighborhoods who lived alone, lacked access to transportation and lacked air-conditioning,'' he said. ''We're talking about people who are already out of sight.'' It is not easy to assess the number of deaths in a heat wave. In 1995, Chicago officials questioned whether the medical examiner's count of 525 was exaggerated; epidemiologists now say it was low. ''As a mathematician I did know whatever the medical examiner said would be undercounting it,'' said Dr. Steven Whitman, who was director of epidemiology for Chicago's Department of Public Health then. For each heat-related death, he said, the medical examiner must confirm one of three factors: a body temperature of 105 degrees or more, a high environmental temperature at the death scene, or decomposition in a body seen alive just before the heat wave. But since autopsies are not performed on all bodies, not all heat-related deaths are recorded. In addition, fatal strokes and heart attacks attended by physicians are generally not counted as heat-related deaths, even if they probably would not have occurred without the heat. For a more accurate picture, Dr. Whitman compared the number of deaths that month, around 3,000, with the expected number in an average month, 2,200, attributing the difference, or ''excess deaths,'' to the heat. Other deadly heat waves in the United States occurred in New York City in 1972, when 891 died; in Los Angeles in 1955, when 946 died; and across the Midwest in 1980, when hundreds were killed. Perhaps surprisingly, cities that suffer most in heat waves are not those in the hottest zones. ''A heat wave is a very relative factor,'' said Dr. Laurence S. Kalkstein, a climatologist at the University of Delaware Center for Climatic Research. ''What makes a heat wave in Duluth is not what makes a heat wave in Dallas. We respond to the normal weather conditions of wherever we live.'' A heat wave, as he defines it, is a variation from normal. Areas with irregular but intense variability, like New York or Chicago, where the temperature can vary by 20 degrees or more in a few days, fare worse than places like Phoenix or Miami, where the weather is warmer but more constant. ''In New York we once calculated a threshold of 93 degrees for a few days, whereas in Phoenix it might be 112,'' Dr. Kalkstein said. Other factors also come into play. Cities bake more intensely under sunny skies than under clouds. Humidity reduces the body's ability to perspire and cool down. Strong winds are more dangerous than still weather because they dry people out. Cities' structures also affect death rates. ''In Philly, which has more row houses than any other city, you've got black tar roofs, brick facades and windows on only two sides,'' Dr. Kalkstein said. ''In Baton Rouge, even the poorest of the poor have what they call shotgun shacks, which have aluminum roofs and windows on four sides,'' allowing more ventilation. It does not take a lot of extra heat to kill the vulnerable. ''The body works in a very small temperature range,'' said Dr. Lawrence Robinson, deputy health commissioner of Philadelphia. ''The body circulates blood to the skin and perspiration removes heat from the skin. In extreme heat, the heart has to pump faster and harder,'' leading to heart attacks or strokes. Even a healthy person who overexerts in the heat can die of heat stroke. Amid fears that global warming will usher in longer and more deadly heat waves, Dr. Kalkstein said weather variability was still more important. If variability in the United States increases or even stays constant, he added, heat deaths could increase from 1,500 to 3,900 by 2050. Just as high temperatures alone do not make a deadly heat wave, poverty alone does not make a heat wave deadly. In Chicago in 1995, a disproportionate number of victims were men living by themselves in single rooms. Nor did all poor communities suffer equally. One poor area with high rates of violence and abandoned buildings had a death rate 10 times as high as that of a similarly poor adjacent area with the same percentage of elderly, solitary residents but a more active street life. ''The areas of the city that had high concentrations of deaths are areas that had lost the viable public spaces, the busy sidewalks, the commercial streets,'' Dr. Klinenberg said. ''Those are the things that draw people out of their home and into social contact.'' Dr. Klinenberg sees the high death rate as a symptom of a problem that already exists in American cities, even when there is no heat wave. ''Heat waves are like urban particle accelerators,'' he said. ''They speed up and make visible conditions that are always there but are difficult to perceive. Living and dying alone is one of those conditions. When hundreds of people die alone and at home behind locked doors and sealed windows out of touch with their families and community support, it's a sign of sweeping social breakdown.'' In the past decade, some cities have mitigated the deadliness of heat waves with response systems that include news media warnings, lists of elderly residents who live alone, heat command centers, water trucks and door-to-door checkups of people at risk. Unlike some natural disasters, heat waves usually allow for some preparation time. ''Information about an oncoming heat wave is available as much as three days in advance, and they take two days to start killing,'' said Dr. Robinson of Philadelphia. Heat-related death rates there have been down since a warning system was introduced seven years ago by the Center for Climatic Research. Chicago, which took criticism for its response to the 1995 heat wave, has also improved its systems, to the point where a 1999 heat wave comparable in intensity to the one of 1995 killed only 110 people. Still, said Dr. Klinenberg, the heat disasters have not gone away. ''If that was an airplane crash, people would still be talking about it today,'' he said of the 1999 heat wave. ''Now, if you ask people, they don't even remember it.''"
"Revising New Jersey's drought restrictions for the third time in five months, the state's top environmental official today banned lawn watering and car washing statewide and directed businesses using large amounts of water to submit plans to cut use by as much as 50 percent. And in a further signal that the state's drought is worsening, Bradley M. Campbell, the commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation, asked businesses using 100,000 or more gallons of water a day to provide a separate economic impact analysis of a 20 percent cut in their use. Speaking at a Trenton news conference, Mr. Campbell said that 7 of the last 12 months were the driest in the state's history and that August was shaping up as the driest August ever. He said that with water supplies declining and use still high despite conservation measures, the state had to act ''immediately and aggressively'' to avert a crisis. Last week, Mr. Campbell repeated his call for strict enforcement of the department's restrictions. Violations can lead to a disorderly persons charge that carries penalties of up to $1,000 in fines and six months in jail. While the new rules ban lawn watering, the restrictions allow for shrubs, trees and planting beds to be watered on an odd-even system. House addresses with even numbers may water only on even-numbered days of the month; those with odd-numbered addresses can water only on odd-numbered days of the month. Commercial car washes that recycle water can still operate. Power washing of buildings is prohibited for all but professional operators. ''Things are getting really serious, if you hadn't noticed,'' said James Sinclair, an environmental specialist with the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, which represents the companies that are among the state's largest water users. ''And the possibility of even further restrictions is a problem because the last thing you want to do at a time like this is adversely affect the economy or employment.'' Mr. Sinclair said that banning car washing and lawn watering was one thing. ''But when you restrict a plant to one shift, that is another,'' he said. In March, the state imposed a drought emergency, which among other things restricted lawn watering to odd/even days and cut water allocations to operations such as golf courses by as much as 50 percent. Restaurants were restricted from providing water to patrons unless they asked. After rains came in late spring, the department in June eased some of the restrictions. But as water demand has since increased and rainfall has diminished, Mr. Campbell reinstituted and ratcheted up the restrictions. He said the plans he was requesting from businesses would help his agency write future restrictions in ways that would have the least adverse impact. Mr. Sinclair said that such plans would allow him to tailor restrictions by region and on a case-by-case basis."
"The Bush administration said today that it would provide $752 million in emergency aid for livestock producers in the West and elsewhere. The move could aid a Republican Senate candidate as well as drought-stricken ranchers. Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman announced the new relief program in a teleconference with Representative John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who is in one of the closest Senate races in the country with control of the chamber at stake in November. ''This program will provide immediate assistance to producers who need it the most,'' Ms. Veneman said. The high-profile help from the White House underscored how the drought has emerged as a political issue not only in South Dakota, but in other farm states like Minnesota, Iowa and Missouri -- all sites of Senate races. But it has been particularly prominent in South Dakota, where some ranchers have been selling their herds because of the severe drought. Mr. Thune has been somewhat on the defensive on the issue since President Bush traveled to South Dakota last month and said he could not endorse new drought help if it drove up the deficit. Mr. Thune's opponent, Senator Tim Johnson, the Democratic incumbent, is seeking $6 billion in relief that is tied up in the Senate. Mr. Johnson's campaign had said Mr. Bush's position showed that Mr. Thune could not get the White House to deliver and challenged Mr. Thune to back the Senate measure. Mr. Thune said today that the new approach would bring help faster. ''With drought relief so uncertain in the Senate, I worked with the administration to deliver critically needed cash assistance to livestock producers,'' he said. Mr. Johnson and the majority leader Tom Daschle, the senior senator from South Dakota, welcomed the new help, but they said it was not enough. ''I hope the administration understands that this assistance is merely a drop in the bucket,'' Mr. Daschle said. ''Farmers and ranchers deserve more than a million-dollar solution to a $6 billion problem.'' Mr. Johnson noted that he had pressed for the release of the very money the administration is using and said ''every little bit helps.'' ''However, let me be clear, this money does not serve as a replacement for emergency disaster assistance,'' he said. The $752 million will come from unspent portions of a fund generated through customs fees. Using those proceeds will allow Mr. Bush to say he provided some help without new spending. Ranchers can begin applying for the cash assistance on Oct. 1 and it will be portioned out on a per-head basis, with $18 per beef cattle as a baseline. Ranchers statewide in Arizona, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota and South Carolina will be eligible, as well as those in disaster-designated counties of South Dakota and 29 other states. The Senate last week added the $6 billion in emergency aid to the spending measure for the Interior Department but it has stalled as both parties, in the run-up to the November elections, have sought to deny each other any political victories through the bill. Much of this week has been devoted to a stalemate over $825 million in emergency firefighting money and efforts by Republicans to attach a plan to thin national forests to reduce the threat of fires. Environmental groups and some lawmakers say the plan is tantamount to a broad change in policy that will expand commercial logging on 10 million acres of national forest. Neither side has been able to make headway. The White House opposes the $6 billion in emergency drought aid but supporters say its cost would be offset by savings in other farm spending, so it would not drive up the deficit."
"On a recent morning 20 miles from this city in the northwest Indian state of Rajasthan, Pauline Alexander and Kusum Bishwas were in the back of a rattling old taxi, cooling their hands on bottles of soda and discussing a girl who had almost died. ''This 9-year-old, her tuberculosis was so bad her mother had to carry her in,'' Ms. Alexander, 76, a nurse, was saying when their taxi swerved to avoid a truck. Ms. Alexander and Mrs. Bishwas, 66, managed to avoid spilling their sodas, and Ms. Alexander finished her story. ''The village girl, I thought when we returned she'd be dead,'' she said. ''But we gave her powdered milk, all the vegetables, medicine for 18 months. Now she's married.'' Ms. Alexander has been heading out on these missions for 17 years now, with whatever help and donated medicine and clothing she can muster. On this hot, dusty morning she and Mrs. Bishwas were on their way to two remote villages. The time was 8:15 and the temperature was already 85. The two women can testify to the effects of prolonged heat. For four years, their section of Rajasthan has been seared by drought, most likely a result of deforestation and increasing temperatures. In that time, ''the diseases have grown much worse,'' Ms. Alexander said. When they pulled into their first village, Peeplevas, it was 9 a.m. and the temperature was nearly 90 degrees, Twenty-five people were waiting for them at a red-roofed hut. A third were women, in veils and iron ankle bracelets. The rest were children. All were tribals, members of the scheduled caste, what used to be called outcastes. The designation has changed, but their situation has not. They are still abysmally poor. One villager ran to get a string bed. She carried it on her head and placed it on the porch, and Ms. Alexander and Mrs. Bishwas went to work. They laid out supplies on the bed: aspirin, iron tablets, multivitamins and medicines. One by one, the tribal women shyly approached. The first two complained of worms, ''a common condition because they walk barefoot,'' Ms. Alexander said. The third had a dreamy look and was speaking in a murmur. Ms. Alexander gave her aspirin for fever, took a minute to record names, illnesses and probable ages -- about 26, she was guessing -- for all three. ''They don't know what year they were born,'' she said. In the car, her voice had been quavery and small. Now her bearing was commanding. ''You will take this twice a day,'' she told a woman with a cough. Mrs. Bishwas, whose high bun of white hair had started to unravel in the heat, was pouring mouth-sore wash into film canisters with the capable air of a lieutenant. Ms. Alexander, slim, stately, with a bun that so far remained fixed, has a nursing degree from Syracuse University in New York. Born in the Himalayas to a family of Brahmins, the highest Indian caste, she arrived at Syracuse through a series of unhappy circumstances. When she was 2, her father died. Her mother converted to Christianity, and her family disowned her. Ms. Alexander's mother tried to scrape by working in a jail. Eventually, Ms. Alexander was placed in a missionary orphanage, where she had to rise each morning at 3 to start breakfast. But the nuns at the orphanage helped her obtain a scholarship to study in the United States. Ms. Alexander has never lived a traditional Indian woman's life. She has taught nursing at hospitals in Fiji, set up public health clinics in Thailand and worked for World Vision in a refugee camp in the Vietnam War. In 1985, she said, she was contemplating retirement but heard a voice say, ''Your work is not finished,'' and began traveling into the villages. For the first few years, until a visitor from Britain donated taxi services, she made the trip three times a week by bus. In Peeplevas, more villagers arrived, streaming across yellow dust fields from several spots beyond the horizon. By 9:30 more then 50 people had arrived, including a few men too old to work or too sick for the hourlong journey to work as day laborers in Udaipur, or beyond. Traditionally, the men and women work the fields, but with the drought, work in the fields nearby is scarce. When the men arrived, most of the Hindu women tugged their veils over their faces. The Christians, Pentecostal converts, kept their faces uncovered. On the porch, a rhythmic litany of medical complaints could be heard. A young man said he had stomach pains. ''From chilies,'' Ms. Alexander said. ''There's been so little rain, they live on a diet of chilies and roti.'' Chilies and bread. An old man in a turban described trouble with his eyes. A teenager with a cow-herding stick and metallic pink polish on his nails had a cough. The men disappeared. The women came unveiled. The litany of complaints continued in a steady beat. A young woman with a child on her hip, holding the side of her veil in her teeth, extended her hand for a jar of cough syrup. ''She is totally blind,'' Ms. Alexander said. ''Five children. We give her a lot of clothes.'' By 10 a.m., the rhythm was waning. Only stragglers remained. A teenage girl reported a discharge, a troubling sign. As the drought has forced men to travel far for work, the incidence of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases has increased. Testing for the diseases costs more than a villager earns all year. All Ms. Alexander could offer were vitamins. Another woman's tongue had the telltale white coat of anemia, which is also increasing as crops wither. For four years, the monsoon was scant. This year, there has been no real monsoon, only light, infrequent rain -- not nearly enough to reverse the effects of a severe drought. No one is sure what is causing the drought. Deforestation, aggravated by global warming, is suspected. But the drought's effects are beyond dispute: an arid landscape that had been lush, water tables down to 150 to 500 feet from 5 and 25 feet, sludgy puddles where lakes had been. By last June, after a string of 115-degree days, it was almost possible to walk across caked mud to Udaipur's famous Lake Palace Hotel, built to look as if it were floating. Most people in towns can still buy water and other necessities. But the villagers have suffered. The scarcity of food and work has shortened tempers and heightened domestic violence. Last winter, several days after Ms. Alexander had visited, a man in one village threw his wife into a well and drowned her. Vitamin A deficiency has increased night blindness. With fewer trees to collect rain, fewer roots are available to hold the soil in place, and the fertile topsoil has eroded. The vegetables that grow have fewer vitamins. ''The diseases in the villages have worsened by 25 percent,'' said Tez Razden, an Udaipur physician. ''Malnutrition, anemia, tuberculosis, malaria, these are all common.'' On the way to the next village, Pai, Ms. Alexander added to the list: ''Scabies from lack of water, conjunctivitis due to flies, diarrhea, pneumonia in winter, bronchitis and cough. Plenty of cough.'' Pai looked slightly more prosperous than Peeplevas, thriving enough to have attracted the attention of a Western advertiser. ''Lifebuoy, for health,'' proclaimed the advertisement plastered onto a building. The rhythm of complaints began anew: measles, shoulder wound, upper respiratory infection. ''This is a girl who had severe tuberculosis,'' Ms. Alexander said, greeting a smiling young woman in a purple sari, holding an infant son. ''When I first saw her she was 1.'' Beside the woman was someone else Ms. Alexander had known for years. ''And this is the one I talked about,'' Ms. Alexander said. A skeletal girl in a polka dot veil approached, smiling nervously. ''Come, come,'' Ms. Alexander said. ''This is the one who had tuberculosis I thought would not survive.'' She spread an ointment for skin rash on the woman's thin arms. ''Her husband is horrible. He beats her,'' Ms. Alexander said. The girl moved on. Ms. Alexander found the log, began writing quickly, angrily. ''That woman will get tuberculosis again,'' she said. ''She doesn't get enough to eat. We brought 90 grams of powdered milk, and he drank it all, with tea.'' An hour later, when the crowd was down to 20, Ms. Alexander noticed the woman again, leaning against a wall, her face covered. ''Give her the rest of the biscuits,'' Ms. Alexander said. But the woman shrank from the bag and would not take it. ''Good work,'' Mrs. Bishwas said in the car going back. ''Tiring work,'' Ms. Alexander said. They passed buff-colored stone walls and a goat on hind legs pulling leaves from a scrawny tree. Ms. Bishwas talked about an acquaintance in the hospital. Ms. Alexander stared out the window. Ms. Bishwas mentioned Avantika Mati, another member of their volunteer group from Udaipur, who was absent this day to tend to her grandchildren. ''She wants us to stop by,'' Mrs. Bishwas said. But Ms. Alexander's mind seemed still to be on the thin woman in Pai, and she nodded distractedly. ''That woman will get it again,'' she said. ''She will get it again.''"
"When famine hit Ethiopia so hard in 1984 that a million people died of hunger, Shuga Bati was among the fortunate. She lives in one of the country's relatively few pockets known for producing a surplus of food. But a sustained drought that relief officials say is even more sweeping than the one that led to the 1980's famine has caused Ms. Bati's luck to run out. She squatted in the dirt today with hundreds of other mothers waiting for food handouts for her and her six undernourished children. Last year, she tried to plant crops, but her land produced nothing -- no sorghum, no corn, no teff, no wheat. ''I've never seen a year like this,'' said Ms. Bati, 45, a forlorn look on her face. ''I feel like crying every time I look at my children.'' Drought and malnutrition are a regular occurrence in this country that has become almost synonymous with hunger. But in recent weeks, aid workers and the Ethiopian authorities have begun sounding the alarm with growing intensity: more people face starvation now, they say, than two decades ago, when famine-relief concerts were raising millions of dollars and images of children with bloated bellies were broadcast into living rooms around the world. ''The scenes I'm seeing are the same ones I saw back then,'' said Representative Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia, who visited Ethiopia in 1984 and returned this week to assess another crisis in the making. ''It's dire.'' What he saw today were the first human victims of drought. After the livestock die -- and much of Ethiopia is now littered with the carcasses of stricken cows -- the next to suffer are the children. Throughout Ethiopia, many children's bellies are protruding, and limbs are too lean and too weak to function. These grim scenes are even visible in areas of the country that have traditionally withstood drought. The statistics bear out the comparisons between the famine of 20 years ago and the one now slowly unfolding across Ethiopia. In the 1984-85 famine, eight million people -- about 18 percent of the population -- suffered food shortages. The crisis hit hardest in the north. The looming crisis in 2003 is expected to affect more than 11 million people, or 16 percent of the expanded populace. Now, the affected area covers a vast swath of the country, from north to south. Eritrea, which broke off from Ethiopia, has growing hunger problems of its own. Nobody expects the sort of mass deaths that marked the earlier famine. Back then, Ethiopia's military government tried to keep the emergency secret from the outside world. By the time aid organizations began responding, rail-thin bodies were dropping dead in the dusty soil. The government's reaction now could not be more different. Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has toured drought-affected regions with reporters in tow and has called on international agencies for help. This time, the government's Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission has been warning of deaths for months, long before any disaster set in. [''Unlike the first time around, we are not trying to hide the problem,'' Mr. Zenawi said in an interview in Addis Ababa, the capital, on Saturday. ''Back then, BBC had to break the news. This time, we're alerting everyone and we're not trying to hinder the assistance.''] Political survival is one factor. The collapse of the military government known as the Derg, which ruled Ethiopia beginning in 1975, was hastened by its poor handling of the drought a decade later. Mr. Zenawi already has his hands full with a variety of opposition parties that are clamoring for his removal. But there is nothing political about the hunger Ethiopians have begun to feel. Aid workers say some of the very young and the very old could begin dying later in the year if governments around the world turn their backs and dismiss this drought as just another Ethiopian disaster. It is true that droughts have come and gone here since the early 1970's and that many of the problems that cause the suffering now visible throughout much of the country will not be solved simply by food shipments. The country's population growth rate is among the world's highest, and the plot sizes are among the smallest. Ethiopia is almost entirely dependent on rain-fed agriculture. Its major source of foreign currency, coffee exports, has been undermined by the lowest prices in the global coffee market in 30 years. The government still owns the farmland, a vestige of the country's socialist days, and leaders have done little to diversify the economy or push long-term development projects that might allow the poor to survive the regular droughts. Despite such entrenched problems, there is a need now that aid workers say cannot be ignored. ''If this turns into a famine, we've all failed,'' said Paul Turnbull, head of emergency operations at the World Food Program in Ethiopia, who worked in the country during the 1984 drought. ''There are a lot of other emergencies in the world, and we can only hope that people don't think, 'Oh my God, not Ethiopia again.' '' The last time the rains did not fall here and the people went hungry was in 2000-2001. Ten million people were affected by that drought, and the United Nations said that as many as 50,000 people died. Foreign aid was sluggish, primarily because Ethiopia was in the midst of a costly border war with Eritrea in which each of the countries was estimated to be spending $1 million a day. That war has ended but there remains much to distract the world from this country that struggles to feed itself even in the best of times. A war in Iraq is looming on the horizon. Terrorist attacks provoke fear around the globe. Southern Africa, traditionally the continent's breadbasket, is in the midst of a food emergency of its own. Still, there are early signs of hope for Ethiopia. Food shipments have begun arriving at the port in Djibouti, where they are loaded on trucks for the long drive to rural Ethiopia. Already, officials say, about a third of the projected assistance needed for the coming year, 1.4 million tons of emergency food aid, has been pledged by an array of governments. United States officials are expected to contribute another third. By pushing and prodding donor governments, the United Nations food agency hopes the rest will arrive before it is too late. Meanwhile, hunger has already arrived in Ethiopia. ''No food,'' Hajo Haje Ombe, 32, said today as she lifted the lid on the large but empty container where she normally stores her family's supply of grain. ''Nothing.'' Like most Ethiopians, she has many mouths to feed, eight children in all. They range in age from the sickly newborn on her back to a pre-teenage girl who looks far younger than her years. Making matters worse, 9 of her 10 cows have died in recent weeks, all drought victims. Fearing that the 10th animal would die as well, she sold it at about a third the normal price. Mr. Wolf, the congressman, peered into Ms. Ombe's empty food storage bin the other day and tramped through her mud hut. ''The cupboard is bare,'' he said, shaking his head and slipping a bill into her hand. An aide was busy videotaping the misery, an effort to focus attention back in Washington, once again, on Ethiopia."
"New Jersey's drought emergency, and a set of water use restrictions that have waxed and waned in intensity over the last 10 months, was lifted today by Gov. James E. McGreevey. New Jersey is one of the last Northeastern areas that wilted through the spring and summer last year to end its drought emergency. New York City ended its emergency in October, and Westchester County followed in November. Noting that recent rain and snow had raised reservoir levels in North Jersey well above normal, the governor said today that he would end the emergency declaration. In doing so, he gave up the power to restrict water use and removed conservation requirements on the four state regions that rely primarily on those reservoirs. Nevertheless, a less restrictive drought warning will apply in the two remaining regions -- the coastal south and the southwest, where ground water and wells are the main source of water. Under the drought warning, said Elaine Makatura, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Environmental Protection, residents are asked to conserve water voluntarily. In three townships along the coast covered by the drought warning, however, the department's commissioner, Bradley M. Campbell, can go so far as to limit new water connection permits. The townships are Egg Harbor, Galloway and Hamilton. In November, state officials eased statewide restrictions on car-washing, lawn-watering and other water uses, after the New York metropolitan region had its seventh-wettest October, and as November rainfall was running half an inch above normal. Ms. Makatura said that state officials, exercising caution, had held off lifting the drought emergency then. She said the officials viewed the water shortages as a continuation of the drought of 1999 -- a drought that seemed to ebb somewhat with Hurricane Floyd in 1999, prompting the state to lift restrictions at the time. But the problems soon returned and worsened, leading to the reinstitution of the emergency. Ms. Makatura said the governor had directed Mr. Campbell and his agency to ''stop dealing from water crisis to water crisis'' and to better manage the state's water resources. ''The commissioner has been directed to develop short- and long-term plans to meet water needs,'' she said. Ms. Makatura said there was no time frame for the department to come up with the plan."
"As New Yorkers optimistically began packing away sweaters and retrieving air-conditioners from winter storage, city officials engaged in a springtime ritual of their own yesterday: turning on the fountains that have been dry since the fall of 2001. Just before noon, while the balmy season that has been something of a flirt lately was still showing itself, officials gathered in all five boroughs to herald the return of artfully moving water to a long-parched city. ''The fountains have been dry and dusty for 17 months, they've been in repose,'' said the parks commissioner, Adrian Benepe, who had joined Deputy Mayor Patricia E. Harris and the environmental protection commissioner, Christopher O. Ward, in turning a ceremonial valve to let the waters flow at City Hall Park in Lower Manhattan. ''The sound of water splashing in a park is one of the sounds inalienably linked to spring in New York,'' he said. ''You could literally not be able to see, and from the sounds you would know that it's spring.'' Officials played host to simultaneous events at five other municipal fountains to celebrate, post-drought, the ability to gather the approximately 1.3 million gallons of water necessary to start up dozens of fountains throughout the city. Those were at Joyce Kilmer Park in the Bronx, Bethesda Terrace in Central Park, the Unisphere in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, South Beach in Staten Island and Columbus Park at Borough Hall in Brooklyn. Even though most fountains maintained by the city recirculate water, they stayed off last summer to remind New Yorkers of the drought emergency, which was lifted toward the end of the year. The drought watch left in its place was lifted in January, and the reservoirs reached full capacity last month. Officials plan to turn on roughly 50 fountains over the next week, but not those needing repair, Mr. Benepe said. Once running, they will continue 24 hours a day until cold weather signals the time to shut them off, generally sometime between Columbus Day and Thanksgiving. But for now, they will be on. Yesterday, the Brooklyn borough president, Marty Markowitz, gathered a dozen or so children from a Brownsville Recreation Center program to throw pennies into the fountain. He invited the adults eating their lunches on the steps of Borough Hall to participate as well. ''I don't know the next time I'm going to be handing out money,'' he coaxed. ''This may be a first.'' One man, a driving instructor named Don Murph, took him up on the offer even though, he said, he had already thrown in a quarter of his own and wished for more affordable housing in Brooklyn. Mr. Markowitz, ever enthusiastic, just might have a way to fulfill it. ''With the budget crisis, every day we'll send someone down to collect the pennies and put it in the general fund,'' he joked. ''We'll use the pennies to fulfill those dreams in Brooklyn. Sounds good to me.''"
"In a nation that calls itself the sunburnt country, it takes a mighty dry patch to reach the record books and knock farmers sideways. But the worst drought in a century -- even kangaroos have strayed from nature reserves to graze on suburban lawns in Canberra -- has throttled agriculture and undermined national wealth. The drought, which has lasted 18 months, slashed farm incomes almost in half, to 7.2 billion Australian dollars ($4.9 billion), in the year ended June 30, according to estimates by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics. Agricultural production was down 28.5 percent in the period, slicing one percentage point, or 7 billion Australian dollars, from gross domestic product. Though the dry spell may finally be coming to an end, with recent good rains in all areas except the north, the drought's impact will continue to be felt for a while, according to the bureau's latest forecast for commodity exports, released last week. Annual farm exports are expected to fall by almost a billion Australian dollars in the year ending June 30. Crop exports are likely to fare better than exports of livestock products, which are forecast to slump 8 percent from the previous year, to 12.8 billion Australian dollars. ''The 'income drought' associated with the previous poor harvest will continue until farmers are able to market this year's crop,'' the bureau's executive director, Brian Fisher, wrote in a statement accompanying the forecasts. The effect on livestock industries ''will linger longer,'' he said, as herds and flock are rebuilt. Australia exports nearly two-thirds of its agricultural products, and the United States is one of Australia's biggest markets, accounting for 11 percent of Australia's total agriculture sales. In the fiscal year 2002-03, exports to America -- mostly of beef -- were worth $11.5 billion Australian dollars. A rise in the value of the Australian dollar against the United States currency has compounded the difficulties of exporters, making their products more expensive and shrinking the return on what they manage to sell. Additional drought-related costs also contributed to a slump in annual average income on the country's 135,000 farms, to 52,900 Australian dollars ($36,000) in 2002-03 from 97,000 Australian dollars a year earlier. The scorching weather in New South Wales, the state with the largest number of farmers, forced many farmers whose livestock usually graze to buy feed. At a cost of 1 Australian dollar a day for each sheep and up to 4 Australian dollars for cattle, this has leached an extra $3,000 Australian dollars a week on average from these farmers' pockets. In the last fiscal year, Australia has had to import 340,000 tons of feed, including 53,000 tons of corn, from the United States. It was the first United States corn exported to Australia in at least two decades. As in America, agriculture is culturally significant here, though it accounts for only about 3 percent of the country's gross domestic product and 17 percent of its total exports. Wheat and beef are among the biggest exports; other agricultural exports include wool, cotton, sugar, fruit and rice. At this month's World Trade Organization meeting in Cancún, Mexico, Australia joined with developing countries to argue against United States and European farm subsidies, saying such agricultural policies disadvantage its own innovative, efficient and unsubsidized producers. In the driest inhabited continent on earth, remote areas accommodate huge livestock stations, running to millions of acres, though most agriculture is on the family farm. There are United States players in the Australian market, too. Australia Meat Holdings, owned by Swift & Company of Greeley, Colo., is the nation's biggest meat producer and processor. Cargill Australia, a unit of Cargill Inc. of Minneapolis, has big operations in oilseed and beef processing, flour milling and grain and cotton trading. Cargill Australia's commercial manager, Tony Day, said this drought had been much tougher than dry periods in 1992 and 1981. ''It's the worst drought in terms of production in crops that we've ever had in Australia,'' Mr. Day said in a telephone interview. On a 3,000-acre cattle farm called Garrawilla East in the state's northwest, prohibitive feed costs forced the owner, Robert Anderson, to make a heartbreaking decision. He sold off nearly all his herd. ''We couldn't afford to buy feed, and even if we could have, we couldn't afford to buy water,'' he said in a recent phone interview. Having avoided overgrazing on his pastures, he was able to board stock for other desperate cattle farmers. ''Once we got past the fact that we'd sold 100 years' worth of breeding stock, we actually managed better than most,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''At least we weren't staring at dying cattle every day.'' He has now switched to boarding cattle for the longer term, trusting that other farmers will need somewhere to graze their stock in the wake of terrible losses of feed crops and the decimation of many pastures. Crops harvested for humans were also hit hard. According to the National Farmer's Federation, production of wheat and barley fell 60 percent, and that of the thirstiest crop, rice, fell almost 70 percent in the year ended in June. Though some agricultural prices rose amid shortages -- wool, for instance, climbed to record levels -- the need to slaughter livestock before the animals starved created a beef glut, causing meat prices to fall 9.2 percent. When Mr. Anderson sold most of his 1,500 cattle in March 2002, he says he secured only 700 Australian dollars a head, about 300 Australian dollars shy of a good year's price. He kept 300 animals to sell gradually when he needed cash and was dismayed when prices fell even further. He said he still had 100 heifers, all now pregnant, and he planned to sell them with their calves -- or maybe keep some to breed. The government estimates that until the retreating winter broke open the clouds six weeks ago, up to 70 percent of the country was in drought. It has made available almost 1 billion Australian dollars in farm assistance, paying out 235 million Australian dollars so far in direct income support, interest-rate relief, financial counseling and skills training to help landowners avoid having to sell the farm. More help, though, may come from the Southern Hemisphere's spring, which has brought sustained rains and hopes of a healthy November harvest. Early last month, the agriculture minister, Warren Truss, announced that while some areas might now see their best crops ever, the government assistance would go on for two years as the herds and flocks are rebuilt. Mr. Anderson also qualified his optimism. His crops are green only on top. ''If it stops raining now, we'll have 90 percent of this state back in serious drought in a month,'' he said. ''We're right on the cusp. A couple of reasonable falls in the next month to six weeks will take us over the cusp into a good season. They're predicting a worse summer than average this season. That could finish us off.''"
"With a severe drought parching Colorado and much of the American West in recent years, Denver's water department decided to take a gamble in the hope of squeezing more precipitation out of the atmosphere. It has invested more than $1 million in cloud seeding in the last two years. Has it paid off? Possibly, some research suggests. The most recent report, issued yesterday by the National Research Council, is inconclusive. ''Evaluation methodologies vary but in general do not provide convincing scientific evidence for either success or failure,'' says the report, titled ''Critical Issues in Weather Modification Research.'' ''Although there is physical evidence that seeding affects cloud processes, effective methods for significantly modifying the weather generally have not been demonstrated,'' it adds. Prepared by an arm of the National Academies, it acknowledges the potential benefits of cloud seeding, designed to wring as much moisture as possible from some storms by adding certain chemicals to existing clouds, and recommends additional research. Chips Barry, the Denver water department manager, is a believer, of sorts. ''I have a reasonably based belief that it works,'' he said. ''It's not the sort of thing where I'll swear that it works. But until our reservoirs are back where they should be, I know I will recommend it again to our board.'' The water board approved his latest recommendation this month, allocating an additional $400,000, bringing the total there to $1.1 million in two years. Dr. Al Cooper, a cloud physicist and director of the Advanced Study Program at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said the benefit could be substantial for a fairly small investment. ''Even if it's wrong,'' he said, ''it's like buying a lottery ticket where not much investment might pay off big.'' The seeding is also cheaper than buying water rights or stored water. Still, said Craig Roepke, the director of the New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission, even people in the cloud-seeding business differ over many aspects of it. ''They're not in agreement on technique, and they're not in agreement on the result,'' he said. Mr. Roepke added, however, that cloud seeding showed ''a great deal of potential.'' Last year his agency unsuccessfully sought $6 million to $10 million from the State Legislature for an experiment in northern New Mexico. The state is now finishing a $100,000 seeding project in its southeastern corner. And the National Research Council report noted that 66 similar project were under way in the United States as of 2001, in addition to those in 24 other countries. Cloud seeding originated in General Electric labs in Schenectady, N.Y., in the 1940's. Some states have used it for decades, as have some ski areas. Vail Resort in Colorado has used Western Weather Consultants for 28 years. ''We believe that cloud seeding impacts our total snowfall approximately 15 to 18 percent over the course of the ski season,'' said Bill Jensen, chief operating officer. ''In certain storm patterns, we see increases as high as 40 percent.'' Mr. Jensen said spending $58,000 a month for three months of seeding was a good investment compared with $50,000 for a night of snow making on eight acres. The cloud-seeding method generally used in the winter and the one used in Denver involves ground-based generators set at high elevations that are literally fired up to release plumes containing silver iodide crystals into storm clouds with temperatures roughly between 7 and 25 degrees Fahrenheit. When water vapor or droplets attach to the silver iodide crystal, latent heat is also released, and it increases cloud size and the duration of storms. In the summer, planes generally drop silver iodide with flares or dry ice pellets into cumulus clouds. This method is also used to prevent hail by injecting the cloud with different amounts of silver iodide at a different place. Because suppressing hail may also inhibit rainfall, this is controversial. One method that many experts say works better, although they are still not certain why, is hygroscopic seeding. It involves planes' dropping calcium chloride or ammonium chloride into rain clouds. Some scientists say they have seen an increase of as much as 109 percent in precipitation with this technique. Experts say that the principle of cloud seeding is increasing precipitation, not changing the weather by creating more storms. ''Cloud seeding can't convert or change a dry year to a wet year,'' said Don Griffith, the president of Northern American Weather Consultants in Sandy, Utah. His company, which analyzed the Denver project, has been seeding clouds over most of Utah's mountainous areas for nearly 30 years. ''Mother Nature is much more powerful than we are,'' he said. ''If the jet stream happens to be north of Utah most of the time and we are drier than normal, cloud seeding is not going to change the location of the jet stream.'' Utah spent about $325,000 last year on winter cloud seeding, Mr. Griffith added, with an increase in moisture of about 15 percent. Mr. Griffith's company estimates that the Denver seeding may have brought an increase of 14 to 17 percent, calculated by comparing precipitation data. But the biggest snowfall to occur during the seeding in March, a three-day storm that left as much as seven feet of snow, was not attributed to seeding. It blew in from the southwest and was not in the path of the seeding generators. Dr. William Woodley of Woodley Weather Consultants in Littleton, Colo., also evaluated the seeding here, by taking samples of snow to determine the amount of silver iodide. ''It's hard to argue for seeding effect if there is little silver iodide,'' he said. ''It only works if you can deliver it to the parts of the clouds that need it. The targets could have been done much better with different generators or put higher on slopes.'' Most of the 40-odd generators used in the project were placed well above 9,500 feet. Property owners are paid to turn them on when the cloud temperature and water content are right. Companies also factor in snow packs and avalanches so as not to make dangerous conditions worse. Not all states are enamored of seeding, and after some Montana farmers and ranchers raised concerns that the process could rob one area of a rain cloud to make rain somewhere else, the Legislature created higher standards for seeding. No seeding has occurred there since 1993. Despite the safeguards, the issue of effectiveness remains. In its most recent policy statement, issued in 1998, the American Meteorological Society said that statistical evidence had shown some increase in precipitation from seeding, while ''physical cause-and-effect relationships, however, have not been fully documented.'' Dr. Roelof Bruintjes, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the principal investor in its cloud seeding experiments, said that improved measurement tools and technology offered the most promise for the future of such work. ''With the new tools, it's a major step forward,'' he said. But Dr. Woodley suggested that policy makers spend less time seeking proof of effectiveness and instead treat seeding as another resource. ''It should be a water management tool, just like conservation, dams and channeling, but not a quick fix,'' he said. ''People shouldn't say: 'Oh, my goodness, we don't have any water. Quick, let's start seeding.' It shouldn't be a political fix, so to speak.'' Mr. Barry of Denver Water describes cloud seeding as more art than science. ''It's better than rain dancing,'' he said. ''I'm pretty sure about that.''"
"ON a hot, dry day last month, on a cul-de-sac in a subdivision in Denver, a clue barely visible to the untrained eye led Jack Rooks to stop his compact Toyota pickup in front of a two-story clapboard house. He examined the evidence and knocked on the door. A dark-haired woman opened it a crack, peering out into the sunlight. ''Y'all are hosing down the area out here,'' Mr. Rooks said, pointing to a length of rubber snaking from the open garage onto the bluegrass lawn. A tiny trickle of water ran into the gutter and down the street. ''You're not supposed to be doing that.'' He issued a warning and got back in his truck. Mr. Rooks is one of 25 drought monitors who work for Denver Water, the independent utility that serves the city. Armed with tough rules about water use -- including designated watering days and times -- and the right to enforce them with fines of up to $500, drought monitors in Denver are just one sign that the region is reeling from the worst drought in a hundred years and struggling to control its thirst. Though the month of May has been relatively moist, Denver Water has already issued 420 warnings. The drought is also inspiring some colorful debates. In some areas, water misers are proclaiming that brown is beautiful and so is plastic turf -- which happens to be illegal in at least two towns. While gardeners scratch their heads, political leaders wrestle over issues like the appropriateness of water surcharges and the once obscure question of who owns the water that flows out of household drains and back into rivers. Though this year's wet spring bodes well, reservoir levels in the Denver area are still well below average, guaranteeing continued employment not only for water monitors but also for ''xeriscapers'' (from the Greek word for dry), who are helping residents learn to stop fretting about their lawns and love water-sparing plants like tall fescue. Denver is part of the Front Range, an area that has been severely affected, in part because of rapid population growth. It includes Aurora and Boulder, a city of 100,000 that has an official water conservation specialist who makes house calls and is booked two months in advance. Big, thirsty Kentucky bluegrass lawns have become a favorite target, and xeriscaping a battle cry, with gardening centers and even real estate companies picking up the cause. But the notion of gardening with little or no water still faces public relations problems. ''People are confused,'' said Rob Proctor, the artistic director for the Denver Botanic Gardens, who says the term xeriscape can conjure images of rock-and-cactus combinations embellished with calf skulls and wagon wheels. He prefers the term ''water-smart gardening,'' which he describes as looking beyond native grasses to attractive imports from regions with similarly dry climates -- snow irises from eastern Asia, say, or daisies that thrive in the mountains of South Africa. '' 'Water-smart' is not not using water,'' he said. ''It's using it really efficiently.'' By any name, the new ethic is changing the face of Denver. Mr. Proctor says brown is a status color in his neighborhood, adding, ''We're all bonding together to have brown lawns and dirty cars.'' This month, the city filled the planters in a 13-block area downtown with drought-tolerant plants, like petunias, salvias and marigolds, a move expected to cut the district's water consumption by 30 percent. Plant choices were based in part on how much sunlight falls on a given area. Shade-loving impatiens, for example, have their own shady patch. One day last month, Boulder's water specialist, Paul Lander, visited Jim and Linda Spencer, the owners of a 1970's ranch house with sweeping mountain views and a large, lush bluegrass lawn with several bald spots. Gamely vowing ''to get you the most for your water,'' Mr. Lander set about probing the soil with a metal tool that measures moisture, offering a mini-course on microclimates flecked with terms like ''evapotranspiration rate'' and ''sprinkler system uniformity.'' ''The south side of this tree is like Albuquerque,'' he declared, standing near an evergreen. ''But the north side is like Montana.'' To hide an ugly patch probably caused by heat reflecting off the tree's dense branches, he recommended either spreading a layer of pine needles or planting some low, heat-loving plants. He also recommended shrinking the size of the lawn by replacing some of it with ornamental grasses, junipers and other plants. In Denver, the water utility remains the focus of intense public interest. This winter, a xeriscaping seminar it offered was so popular it was forced to turn away about 100 people in the first week. The utility's board members are about to vote on hot topics like whether to make cash reimbursements of up to $950 to residents who, for example, replace bluegrass with water-efficient buffalo grass. Some residents have given up gardening altogether. A number of Front Range lawns are now paved with a soft and surprisingly realistic-looking ground cover made of two-inch plastic ''blades.'' The water-no-more lawn has additional benefits: no more weeding or mowing, either. Glenn Angstadt, a commercial landscaper and an owner of Evergreen Synthetic Turf Systems in Boulder, says the plastic turf can be installed for about $7 a square foot and will stand up not only to drought, but also to dogs, children and neglect. He and his partner, Steve Crowder, just finished a lawn for Mr. Crowder's parents. Deon Jachetta, a resident of Thornton, which is also in the Front Range, was so enthusiastic about his synthetic lawn ($9,000 from AstroLawn, the inventor of AstroTurf) that he became a distributor. Plastic grass helped him cut his water bill by 70 percent, he said, but by then he had learned that his town, like Aurora, prohibits fake turf in landscaping -- even in the privacy of one's own backyard. ''I'm extremely disappointed,'' he said, resigned to the task ahead: yanking up his new yard and replacing it with a mix of sod and rock. The severity of the drought has created similarly conflicting impulses elsewhere. Mr. Rooks, the Denver drought monitor, said the greatest number of violations occur in new subdivisions, where homeowners' associations may require lawns to be green, leaving homeowners caught between upholding a covenant and obeying city restrictions. Some residents to whom Mr. Rooks has issued tickets, he said, have complained that they might otherwise be subject to fines from the association. (The city of Aurora, meanwhile, has started threatening home associations with fines of up to $8,000 if they overwater their common areas.) In February, when Denver Water decided to pass out buckets to residents, the idea was simple: collect spillover while showering and use it to wash the dog, do the dishes or water plants. But under Colorado law, the water that goes down home drains, which ultimately returns to rivers, is ''owned'' by users downstream. The water in the South Platte River basin, which encompasses Boulder and Denver, for example, is used an average of 4.5 times before leaving the state. ''According to some water lawyers, if we diminish the amount that we're putting down our drains then we're diminishing the water for the downstream users,'' said Liz Gardener, the manager of water conservation for Denver Water. ''I get hollered at by the downstream users for my conservation practices. But if I don't, I get hollered at by upstream users for not conserving water we're getting from the West Slope,'' she said, referring to the Colorado River on the other side of the Rockies. Drought-related tensions have sprung up in some areas, with neighbors reporting on one another for having suspiciously green lawns, only to discover that the source of all that green is a private well or an irrigation ditch. Some residents who do not draw from the water utility put up signs to explain why they are free to run sprinklers. But to others it seems like a way of saying, ''Sorry your lawn is brown and mine is green.'' The subtext for all this is deciding what, exactly, makes sense for semiarid regions. ''Some would say that landscapes here should not look like landscapes in the East,'' said Michael Holleran, a professor of urban planning at the University of Colorado and an expert on water use and historic landscapes. He added: ''It's obscene to go out and take however many acres of high plains grassland and turn it into a bright green 'chem lawn.' '' Mr. Holleran believes some swaths of green lawn are justifiable -- such as in downtown civic areas or in tiny patches. ''Let the people who want to simulate an Eastern landscape do it on an eleventh of an acre. You want to be a cowboy? Cowboys had sagebrush. They didn't have sprinklers.''"
"DURING a recent family lunch, with the summer breeze softly making sails of our curtains, my wife prodded me, ''So when does this high-tech lawn mower you're testing swing into action?'' ''Oh, it's doing the backyard right now,'' I said. ''But I don't hear anything,'' she said. That was precisely the point. Well, not the only point. Instead of a high-decibel, ear-shattering engine, all that could be heard was a low electric whirring as the latest robotic mower, a second-generation model called the RoboMower RL800 from Friendly Robotics (www.friendlyrobotics.com), trimmed our grass. Admittedly, I was mainly interested in the idea of a mower that would cut my lawn at preset times while I read a book. But such high-tech yard-care products, from mowers to sprinkler systems, are drawing more attention for various reasons. Some have rechargeable batteries or other features that conserve energy or reduce pollution. Some offer ways to conserve water. And others appeal to those who simply do not want quiet afternoons disturbed even for the sake of a well-coiffed lawn. Further appealing to the environmentally conscious, the $700 RoboMower is a mulching mower. It churns the grass beneath its triple blades into a powder that stays on the lawn. The mulch acts as a natural fertilizer, eliminating the need for chemical fertilizers. A competing robotic mower, the $1,500 Auto Mower from Husqvarna (www.husqvarna.com), also mulches, as do many other electric and gas mowers, though some offer the feature only as an option. Environmental friendliness is a big attraction for customers like Bryan Embry of La Grange, Ky. Mr. Embry drives a Honda Insight electric hybrid car and used to push a cordless electric mower before purchasing a RoboMower. The cool factor in owning a gizmo that crawls across his lawn under its own direction, powered by a rechargeable battery, has made him even more of a believer. ''My neighbors sit and watch it,'' he said. Now he is considering training a Web-connected camera on it ''so that everyone can watch it online.'' For many, such gadgets are more than just a novelty. ''It's the first time since I lost my sight 20 years ago that I've been able to handle the yard by myself,'' said Rick Wells, a RoboMower owner in Kernersville, N.C. Mr. Wells and his wife, Alysia, are blind, and until he bought a robotic mower they had to rely on neighbors to cut their grass. Snap the cover off the RoboMower, and instead of an oily carburetor and grimy spark plugs you will find a 16-bit Hitachi microprocessor sitting on a circuit board. The microprocessor coordinates two small electric motors, temperature sensors, a digital compass, four electromagnetic sensors, a lift sensor and bumper impact sensors. To keep the mower cutting in a straight line, the compass and microprocessor use a navigation system originally developed for missile systems. A green wire that you stake into the ground forms a perimeter fence and emits an electromagnetic signal to make sure the mower stays on your property. And the latest RoboMower model talks to you, admonishing you to read the manual before you set it in motion and complaining in ''Lost in Space'' robot fashion (''Danger! Please remove the battery before lifting'') when you pick it up in the middle of its chores. It even warns you with an electronic ''Charge!'' bugle call when it's about to start mowing. The low-slung RoboMower cannot negotiate hills, however, and it can get stuck on backyard swing sets unless you lay down extra perimeter wire. For more challenging terrain, push electric mowers like the Neuton Cordless Electric Lawnmower ($399), offer a quiet alternative. The Neuton also uses a rechargeable battery, and its maker says it generates only about 70 decibels of noise, compared with 100 decibels or more for a conventional gas-powered mower and 75 decibels for a typical conversation. There are some drawbacks, however. The Neuton takes about 12 hours for a full charge, which typically provides three hours of operation. And because it cuts a slightly smaller swath than a conventional mower and lacks the horsepower of a gas-powered model, you have to push the 48-pound mower at a slower pace, so it takes about twice as long as a conventional mower to cut the grass. On the other hand, you don't have to worry about changing the oil, spilling gas, getting tune-ups or inhaling the exhaust. (The Environmental Protection Agency attributes about 5 percent of the nation's air pollution to lawn equipment.) Sales of electric mowers, robotic or otherwise, are still far surpassed by those of conventional gas-powered ones. According to Friendly Robotics, about five million gas-powered mowers are sold annually in the United States, while the number of electric mowers sold is in the thousands. Slow acceptance is not deterring manufacturers from devising other computer-controlled lawn gear, however. With last summer's drought in much of the country still fresh in many gardeners' minds, the one necessary ingredient for a verdant lawn, water, has become more of a concern. But the most common solution, conventional sprinkler systems with timers, can waste water by dowsing lawns already soaked by rain. ''Outdoor automatic watering systems are incredibly inefficient,'' said Dale Hitt, an avid gardener in San Jose, Calif., and the product marketing manager for the original TiVo digital video recorder. His work on high-tech start-ups prevented him from attending to his lawn on a regular basis, he said, ''so I explored a bunch of technologies, including moisture sensors and controllers.'' Mr. Hitt, the founder of Digital Sun, came up with the S.Sense sprinkler, which relies on battery-powered wireless sensors that are inserted in the ground like tent stakes. Each sensor gauges the moisture content below the surface and then tells the sprinkler system to turn on when it gets too dry and to shut off when the ground is wet enough. A starter kit with a wireless receiver that can sense signals from up to 200 feet and attaches to existing sprinkler systems is to be introduced this summer and will cost $150. ''You will not only get the benefit of watering the right amount but also the benefit of helping to conserve water and saving money,'' Mr. Hitt said. Indeed, according to Bob Day, director of customer service at the San Jose Water Company, people in the area with large lawns can generate monthly water bills of several hundred dollars during the peak growing season. Consequently, the company will conduct a field test of the S.Sense system later this summer with residential and corporate customers. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California plans a similar test in the San Diego area. While most lawn care providers may still be pushing or riding on gas-powered machines and hauling out the hose when the lawn starts to turn brown, the digital innovators are making inroads. Friendly Robotics, an Israeli company, points out, for example, that sales of its RoboMower have doubled each year since the first model was introduced in the United States three years ago, partly because of the labor-saving factor. (''It's like a dishwasher to me,'' said Ken Burgess of Floyd's Knob, Ind., who bought a RoboMower in July 2000 and another one in March 2002.)The company plans to expand its offerings, introducing, for example, a robotic vacuum to be sold under the Hoover brand by the end of the year. It will compete against the Roomba, a robotic vacuum that is already on the market. ''We're also looking at robotic snowblowers,'' said Dennis Willis, Friendly's director of marketing for North America, ''and robotic garbage caddies that roll out your bins to the curb on pickup day.''"
"Famine is again stalking Ethiopia -- this time casting a wider shadow. While a million people died in the famine of 1984 and 1985, today more than 12 million are at risk, half of those children under 15. Perhaps the most chilling aspect of today's crisis is that the famine persists despite generous outside food aid. Donations of wheat, soybeans and oil can stave off much of the starvation in the short term, but they cannot keep hunger from returning year after year. Drought is the primary reason Ethiopians go hungry, but it intertwines with other factors that keep Ethiopians too poor and too sick to recover from drought years. The world, which thankfully has fully met Ethiopia's appeal for emergency food, needs to address these underlying problems. While Ethiopia is an extreme case, it is an ominous leading indicator of what may soon happen in other African nations. Rural Ethiopians have never fully recovered from the famine of 1984, nor the severe droughts that have come after, especially in 1999 and 2000. The impact of drought in Ethiopia is magnified by the country's deforestation and the depletion of soil by farmers who cannot afford to let land lie fallow. The effects of dry periods linger long after the rains return. Drought reduces harvests and deprives livestock of water and pasture, forcing farmers and animal herders into a spiral of debt. Washington's extravagant subsidies for America's cotton farmers have added to the problem by undercutting the export market for Ethiopian cotton, one of the country's major products. Even if the rains are good, each year Ethiopians get hungrier. Next year they will have poorer health, fewer cows and sheep, a smaller stock of seeds, less money and more debt than this year. The long-term issue is poverty -- famine hits those too destitute to buy food or produce their own. Fighting famine inside Ethiopia means providing not only emergency food but also programs to help people emerge from the trap of destitution. Rural Ethiopians need more markets for their crops and better roads to be able to move their products to other parts of the country. They could use projects to make water accessible to poor peasants, seed banks and programs to increase livestock supplies. And they need better health care -- the government spends only $1.50 per person for health care each year, although Ethiopia now has more than two million people with the AIDS virus, and the infection is exploding. Some countries in southern Africa are also beginning to suffer from hunger that does not go away, and their tribulations may turn into persistent famine as droughts intensify and AIDS incapacitates more and more workers. International donors are much readier to ship grain than to attack difficult, long-term development goals. But without such help, food aid will become a permanent necessity. Famine is not a sudden event but an evolving process, one that involves much more than food."
"After decades of indulgence, the great American thirst for domestic turf is becoming literally unquenchable. The nation's 50 million lawns drink 270 billion gallons of water every week. Depending on the city, between 30 and 60 percent of urban fresh water is used for watering lawns. So when water shortages strike, as they increasingly do, the lawn feels it first. Now, from the fertile land of turf science comes a blade of hope: a variety of grass called siltgrass or seashore paspalum. The grass is drought-tolerant (it grows on as little as half the water of the classic grasses) and can withstand the occasional dousing of salt water -- a sure death warrant for the average lawn. The grass is ideal for oceanfront fairways and properties, where salt spray is common. This year, for the first time, the PGA World Cup golf tournament was played on paspalum at the Ocean Course in South Carolina. And paspalum can thrive on reclaimed or recycled ''gray'' water. Of course, the latest miracle grass doesn't address the underlying problem: homeowners are flocking to Arizona, New Mexico, Southern California -- regions of little rain. No scientist, it seems, has figured out how to satisfy the yen for lawn where no lawn should be. Alan Burdick"
"Kevin Compton, a 48-year-old grain farmer, recently walked into his corn field to inspect the damage from a summer-long drought. He tore open an ear of corn and grimaced. ''Look at this little bitty ear,'' he said, revealing a stunted, partly rotted corn cob. ''This won't amount to nothing. Everything's gone.'' Mr. Compton then hopped in his Ford Explorer and drove a mile east to inspect some soybean acreage. It was even worse. ''You see these spots?'' he said, fingering a withering, pale-green soybean pod. ''These are dying. When you look at these pods, you see about 8 or 10. Normally, you'd have 30 or 40.'' Farmers all over the state are making similar assessments because of what state officials say is one of the worst droughts in the Plains states in decades. This community in northeastern Kansas is one of the areas hit hardest. For the second straight year, Kansas and parts of Missouri and Nebraska have suffered through an extremely dry summer that has brought back memories of the 1930's Dust Bowl. A shortage of rainfall and a series of 100-degree days have destroyed crops on millions of acres and dried up streams, creeks and rivers, state officials said. All over Kansas there have been scenes of loss and despair. Farmers have been harvesting corn that matured too early and turning it into animal feed. Ranchers have been hauling water to cattle grazing on shriveled pastures. Even grain sorghum, which is considered more drought-resistant than other crops, is dying in the fields. Recent downpours that flooded the eastern part of the state came too late to save many crops, state and agriculture officials said. ''The rains were beneficial, but they didn't save anything,'' said Mary Knapp, the Kansas state climatologist. ''We need continuing rains to end this.'' Some farmers have had to take drastic steps. ''Farmers are cutting their corn for silage because it's not good enough to grow,'' said Lisa Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Agriculture. Farmers had hoped this year would be better than last, when they lost more than $1 billion worth of crops to drought. The losses could be as high this year. Congress offered about $200 million in drought aid in 2002. This year, state officials are planning to ask the federal government for more relief. Indeed, the United States Agriculture Department's weather crop report recently showed that about 55 percent of the state's corn crop and 61 percent of its soybean crop were ''poor to very poor.'' One of the few bright spots for Kansas farmers was last winter's wheat crop, which resulted in an unusually good harvest. Many farmers who expect huge losses from this summer's corn and soybean crops are hoping for another strong winter wheat crop, which is planted in October and harvested in June. There is already a rush to buy seed for winter wheat, agricultural officials here say. Kansas ranchers are also faring well by selling their cattle early to take advantage of a strong demand for beef. ''Market prices are extremely good,'' said Todd Domer, a spokesman for the Kansas Livestock Association. ''They're near all-time highs.'' The pessimistic report from the Department of Agriculture came at the end of August, when parts of Kansas were suffering through 11 consecutive days of 100 degree heat; on Day 12, the temperature was 99. Parts of Kansas were so dry that restrictions on water use and rules against trash burning were put into effect to conserve water and prevent wildfires. Some reservoirs were 14 to 20 feet below normal levels. Along Interstate 70, which stretches in this state from Kanorado, near the Colorado border, east to Kansas City, there are dying trees, acres of stunted soybeans and fields of deformed, earless corn. Corn fields that typically average 150 bushels an acre are now yielding just 30 or 40, local farmers say. The harvest began weeks ahead of schedule because farmers wanted to salvage part of the corn. Here in the northeastern part of the state, the remaining corn is so brittle that a recent wind storm knocked over huge fields of it. Soybean farmers are not much better off. Many soybean crops look as though they have stopped growing altogether. The dark greens have gone pale, like some tree tops. ''This is the second year in a row,'' said Kenlon Johannes, a spokesman for the Kansas Soybean Association. ''It was bad in 2000; 2001 was O.K., 2002 was bad, and this year is bad. Three out of the last four years have been tough.'' After going nearly two months with little or no precipitation, people in Kansas were joking that they would not know rain if it hit them smack on the head. ''Rain, what's rain?'' said Stanley McCauley, a farmer driving a pickup truck on Main Street in nearby Highland, just before the downpours. At Ernie's restaurant and pool hall in downtown Highland, everyone had something to say about the weather. ''People are driving trucks up and down the Nemaha River,'' said Artie Lucas, an insurance agent who was eating chicken strips and potatoes. ''That's a tributary of the Missouri River.'' Someone in the crowded hall called on Wilbur Winter, 87, to comment on the drought. Mr. Winter, a retired farmer, sought to put things in historical perspective. ''I remember '36,'' he said. ''That was the Dust Bowl. We had 36 days over 100 degree temperatures. This isn't as bad as then, but this is bad.'' In a state dominated by farmers and the business of farming, the drought has rippled through the economy. ''Everyone's tightening up,' said Emmett Cole, who operates a grain and fertilizer business in Highland. ''They've quit spending money, and they're cutting back on their farm inputs.'' While the rains came too late for the summer crop, they could help the winter wheat. In Everest, the first rains came late in the afternoon. People all over town ran outside, as though they had never seen rain. Lanette McKee, the postmaster, went out and stood in front of the post office to marvel at the sight of raindrops pounding the sidewalks. ''I can't believe this is rain,'' Ms. McKee said. ''Boy, is it coming.''"
"In the early 1960's, the nation's environmental movement cut its baby teeth on a fierce battle to stop construction of dams along the Colorado River. Two proposed dams were never built, but Glen Canyon dam, located in an unprotected area, was completed in 1963. Over the next 17 years, water backed up for 186 miles, forming Lake Powell and inundating Glen Canyon and hundreds of miles of side canyons. The defeat was deeply felt. David Brower, who was executive director of the Sierra Club, called the death of Glen Canyon the greatest disappointment of his life. Edward Abbey, the mischievous author and defender of the natural world, called Glen Canyon the ''living heart'' of the Colorado River and Lake Powell a ''blue death.'' He often spoke of floating a houseboat filled with explosives to the base of the dam to get rid of ''Lake Foul.'' What Mr. Abbey and the Sierra Club couldn't or didn't do nature has now accomplished. A severe Western drought -- some say the worst in 500 years -- is shrinking Lake Powell at the rate of up to a foot every four days. Since 1999, the vast reservoir has lost more than 60 percent of its water. Glen Canyon is returning. It is open and viewable in much of its former glory. At the confluence of Coyote Creek and Escalante River, where boaters once motored by to see famous rock formations, backpackers now pick their way up a shallow river channel. Fifteen-foot high cottonwoods grow amid thickets of willow, gamble oak and tamarisk. Where fish thrived, mountain lions prowl. The change may be permanent. ''Short of several back-to-back years with 100-year runoff, Lake Powell will never be full again,'' said Dr. Tom Myers, a hydrologic consultant in Reno, Nev. Downstream users now consume 16.5 million acre-feet of water, but on average only 15 million acre-feet flow into the system each year, he said. Add more than a million acre-feet of water lost to evaporation and it is obvious that only during relatively wet years is it possible to add water. The struggles over Glen Canyon and the other dams on the Colorado River above the Grand Canyon were among the battles that led to the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act and clean air and water legislation. Among these successes, the dam was a defeat that has not been forgotten. In 1981 the radical environmental group Earth First! unfurled a 300-foot-long sheet of plastic shaped like a crack down the dam's face. Now, Dr. Richard Ingebretsen, a physician and founder of the Glen Canyon Institute in Salt Lake City, a group dedicated to draining Lake Powell and restoring Glen Canyon to its natural state, says: ''The drought is a godsend. Now is the chance for us to have the national debate we didn't have 40 years ago. With the lake so low, people can see what was lost, the life cycles, the ecosystem. There is a powerful beauty here that can change people's minds.'' The changes are stunning. When it was full five years ago, the lake had 250 square miles of flat water and thousands of miles of fractal shoreline. Each year, two and a half million people came to enjoy vacations with boating, swimming, fishing. The lake was rimmed by a starkly beautiful landscape; filmmakers shot movies like ''Planet of the Apes'' and ''The Greatest Story Ever Told.'' Today the lake is down 129 feet, back to the size it was in 1970, covering 131 square miles. Canyon walls are plastered with a chalky white bathtub ring of calcium carbonate 10 stories high, where the water once reached. Towering benches of silt line the former lake bed. This year 1.8 million visitors are expected. ''The lake is still beautiful,'' said Char Obergh, an information officer for the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in Page, Ariz. ''People can see more features than ever with the water low.'' Paul Ostapuk, a spokesman for Friends of Lake Powell in Page, said: ''Droughts are a regular part of the Colorado River. The lake draws down and it fills up again.'' In the meantime, he said, families can still get together on the lake for a wonderful time. In two years, depending on the weather, Lake Powell could reach what hydrologists call inactive pool, meaning the water stored in the lake will not produce enough flow to generate hydroelectric power. A year or two after that, water could drop another 120 feet. At that point, because of the steepness of canyon walls at the dam, Lake Powell would still have two million acre feet of water spanning 32 square miles, offering continued recreation opportunities. At that same point, hundreds of miles of side canyons would emerge into sunlight offering backpackers a chance to see what was lost. In an expedition down the Colorado River in 1869, John Wesley Powell provided English names for dozens of features like Tapestry Wall, 1,000-foot-high sand dunes frozen into rock and stained with veils of black desert varnish, and Music Temple, a vast grotto of sinuous stone where a person could hum a note for one second and still hear it resonating 11 seconds later. Canyons that would be exposed include Dungeon, Labyrinth, Anasazi, Iceberg, Moki, Last Chance, Mystery Rock, Hidden Passage, Twilight and Lost Eden. Already some features are back, including a stretch of Imperial rapids and a Native American sarcophagus that once held a mummy, now stored in a nearby museum. But the side canyons are the real miracles of Glen Canyon, said Chris Peterson, executive director of the Glen Canyon Institute who started revisiting the Escalante River at Coyote Creek in 1999. That year the lake was down only a short distance, he said, but a riot of plants had sprung to life overnight. Dr. David Wegner, an expert on canyon ecology and the president of Ecosystem Management International in Durango, Colo., explained why. First, most side canyons are made of porous Navajo sandstone, which has acted like a huge sponge for 30 years. As the reservoir drops, the stone can't drain as quickly. That water steadily trickles out, feeding the desert ecosystem. Second, the retreating lake leaves sediment loaded with nutrients. Seeds that fall germinate quickly in the shade. Insects, amphibians and birds come back followed by rodents, raccoons, deer and panthers. Glen Canyon has been called a lost Eden, largely because the conditions are perfect for life. The side canyons, with deep shade and sculptured grottoes, were always the ecological pump for much of the life in the Grand Canyon and beyond, Dr. Wegner said. Last spring Mr. Peterson and his colleagues began leading small groups down the Escalante River to see the recovery firsthand. This fall, trekkers can walk 15 miles downriver, barefoot, marveling at the sights, sounds and smells. To everyone's surprise, the bathtub ring is disappearing rapidly. Summer monsoons are washing it away. There is very little human garbage in the shin-deep river that runs through the old lake bed. On a recent exploration, hikers saw only a plastic bucket and a bottle. The air smells sweet. Clear springs flow out of newly exposed rock. The river bottom is the consistency of confectioner's sugar, a very soft silt that is prone to form pockets of quicksand. As attractive as the exposed canyon is, hiking there can be challenging. It is already possible to explore small side canyons. Scrambling up and into one of these grottoes is to enter a world of haunting beauty. Out on the river, the air is hot and dry. Suddenly the world turns cool, dark, quiet. Sheer and curved walls of red, orange and ocher-colored rock hold hanging gardens of maidenhair ferns. There are datura often painted by Georgia O'Keeffe, along with orchids, scarlet monkey flowers and cave primrose. One recent visitor, Alvin Colville, a retired rancher from Del Norte, Colo., first came to Glen Canyon in 1962 when he was 31. ''These side canyons are what called me back,'' he said, hoisting a pack onto his back. ''They're small, cozy, quiet, magnificent. In many places you could touch both walls. The sky was a little blue slot up above.'' Harry Garabedian and Betsey McNaughten of Deering, N.H., were also on the Escalante River recently on a weeklong hiking trip. ''It's beautiful to watch the full moon bounce up over the cliff tops,'' Mr. Garabedian said. But the lakeshore bears witness to recent years. ''Every rock you turn over has toilet paper under it from the years this was a campsite for boats.'' Mr. Peterson said there was one side canyon farther downstream that he could hardly wait to visit on foot. The size of two football fields, overhung with glowing orange and red rock, Cathedral Canyon is perhaps the most famous lost feature in Glen Canyon. To Edward Abbey it was grander than all the cathedrals in Europe. It was a place where he expected to see ''a rainbow colored corona of blazing light, pure spirit, pure being, pure disembodied intelligence, about to speak my name.'' Five years ago it was under 140 feet of water; now, just 18. Last year it had a waterfall five feet high. This summer a monsoon cleared out silt so that the waterfall is now 20 feet high. If it is speaking Mr. Abbey's name it is whispering now, but if the water keeps receding, it may soon be shouting."
"Even in May, an extraordinary number of Westerners -- especially those who live in the Rocky Mountain states -- are still talking about March. In many places, it was an unusually warm month without precipitation. March put an end to the hope -- a well-worn hope by now -- that the weather would return to normal in a region that is now entering its fifth year of drought. Every indicator is grievous. Ranchers have radically destocked the range. In Arizona and New Mexico, more than a million acres of pinyon and ponderosa pine have died off. Critical reservoirs, like Lake Powell, are holding less than half their capacity. The Rio Grande is a trickle. The entire drainage of the Colorado River -- the ultimate source of water for much of the metropolitan West -- is at risk. A drought of this severity naturally calls into question the definition of ''normal.'' It appears, in fact, that what is normal is an oscillation in climate, from wet periods, like 1976 to 1998, to dry periods, which have recurred with some regularity. So far, this is a five-year drought. But no one knows how long it will last. The climatic history of Arizona, for instance, has been reconstructed by painstaking analysis of tree rings. That research shows that there have been two droughts that lasted 18 years and one, near the end of the 16th century, that lasted 28 years. Tree-ring evidence also shows that for parts of Arizona, 2002 was the driest year in the past 1,400 years. This drought still isn't as dire as the one from 1900 to 1904. But everything in the West has changed since 1904. In fact, everything has changed since 1976, when two wet decades led to an almost unimaginable explosion of development and population across the region, an explosion that, in some places, is rapidly drawing down underground aquifers. In the short run, that pace of growth is unsustainable. In the long run, the question is whether the West can sustain even the growth it has managed so far. The strain of a drought affecting such a huge population causes real fissures in society. Some people have begun to call for overhauling the body of water law that parcels out the Colorado River, while others cling ever more tightly to the rights those laws afford them. Farmers and ranchers find themselves pitted against the suburbs. Meanwhile, the legal consumption of water always comes ahead of preserving in-stream flows, which means that natural habitats and the creatures that live in them come last. While there is some comfort in learning that periodic droughts are a part of natural climate change, the fact is this drought is occurring at a time when climate change is being driven by unnatural global warming. Drought may be normal, and yet there may be nothing historically normal about this drought."
"At five years and counting, the drought that has parched much of the West is getting much harder to shrug off as a blip. Those who worry most about the future of the West -- politicians, scientists, business leaders, city planners and environmentalists -- are increasingly realizing that a world of eternally blue skies and meager mountain snowpacks may not be a passing phenomenon but rather the return of a harsh climatic norm. Continuing research into drought cycles over the last 800 years bears this out, strongly suggesting that the relatively wet weather across much of the West during the 20th century was a fluke. In other words, scientists who study tree rings and ocean temperatures say, the development of the modern urbanized West -- one of the biggest growth spurts in the nation's history -- may have been based on a colossal miscalculation. That shift is shaking many assumptions about how the West is run. Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, the states that depend on the Colorado River, are preparing for the possibility of water shortages for the first time since the Hoover Dam was built in the 1930's to control the river's flow. The top water official of the Bush administration, Bennett W. Raley, said recently that the federal government might step in if the states could not decide among themselves how to cope with dwindling supplies, a threat that riled local officials but underscored the growing urgency. ''Before this drought, we had 20 years of a wet cycle and 20 years of the most growth ever,'' said John R. D'Antonio, the New Mexico State engineer, who is scrambling to find new water supplies for the suburbs of Albuquerque that did not exist a generation ago. The latest blow was paltry snowfall during March in the Rocky Mountains, pushing down runoff projections for the Colorado River this year to 55 percent of average. Snowmelt is the lifeblood of the river, which provides municipal water from Denver to Los Angeles and irrigates millions of acres of farmland. The period since 1999 is now officially the driest in the 98 years of recorded history of the Colorado River, according to the United States Geological Survey. ''March was a huge wake-up call as to the need to move at an accelerated pace,'' said Mr. Raley, assistant secretary of the interior for water and science. Losing Water at Lake Powell Some of the biggest water worries are focused here on Lake Powell, the vast blue diamond of deep water that government engineers created in one of the driest and most remote areas of the country beginning in the 1950's. From its inception, Lake Powell, the nation's second-largest artificial lake, after Lake Mead in Nevada, was a powerful symbol across the West. Some saw it as a statement of human will and know-how, others of arrogance. Powell, part of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, has lost nearly 60 percent of its water and is now about the size it was during the Watergate hearings in 1973, when it was still filling up. White cliffs 10 stories high, bleached by salts from the lake and stranded above the water, line its side canyons. Elsewhere, retreating waters have exposed mountains of sediment. The tourist economy here in Page has been battered. The National Park Service, which operates the recreation area, has spent millions of dollars in recent years just to lay concrete for boat-launch ramps that must be extended every year, a process that one marina operator here called ''chasing water.'' Daniel C. McCool, a professor of political science at the University of Utah and director of the American West Center, says Powell is the barometer of the drought because what has happened here is as much about politics, economics and the interlocking system of rules and rights called the law of the river as it is about meteorology. Part of the lake's problem, for example, dates to a miscalculation in 1922, when hydrologists overestimated the average flow of the Colorado River and locked the number into a multistate agreement called the Colorado River Compact. The compact, along with a subsequent treaty with Mexico, requires Lake Powell to release 8.23 million acre-feet of water each year below the river's dam, Glen Canyon, no matter how much comes in. Because the river's real average flow was less than the 1922 compact envisioned, Powell very often released more than half of the water the Colorado River delivered. But it did not really matter because the upper basin states were not using their share. Now, communities from Denver to Salt Lake City and Indian tribes with old water rights in their portfolios are stepping forward to stake their claims. Lake Powell, which has been called the aquatic piggy bank of the upper West, is overdrawn. If water levels continue to fall, Powell will be unable to generate electricity as early as 2007 or sooner, some hydrologists say. And it would be reduced more or less to the old riverbed channel of the Colorado River not long after that. Even now, the lake's managers say, it would take a decade of historically normal rainfall to refill it. ''If we're only in the middle of this drought, then Lake Powell might be very close to some very dramatic problems,'' said Dr. John C. Dohrenwend, a retired geologist for the Geological Survey who lives near the lake. Insufficient water for the Glen Canyon Dam turbines would be only the beginning. At that point, much of the lake bottom would be exposed, creating a vast environment for noxious weeds like tamarisk and thistle. The next step in the spiral would come at what is called ''dead pool,'' where decades' worth of agricultural chemicals at the lake bottom would begin mixing more actively with the reactivated river. The question then, environmentalists say, is what would happen to the Grand Canyon, just south of the dam. An Issue That May Go to Congress ''Americans won't stand for the Grand Canyon being endangered,'' said John Weisheit, the conservation director for Living Rivers, an environmental group in Moab, Utah, that advocates removing the dam at Glen Canyon and allowing the river to return to its natural course. ''In another year, they're going to be talking more seriously about Powell in Congress.'' But the fact is, no one knows: the weather could change tomorrow. Many past Western droughts have ended suddenly, with a bang of precipitation. But some dry spells persisted for generations. From about 900 to 1300, scientists say, periodic drought in the West was the norm. Only a few times during that period, according to tree-growth measurements, was precipitation anywhere near the relatively high levels of the 20th century. ''What is unusual is not the drought periods, but the above-average wet periods,'' said Dr. Robert Webb, a hydrologist with the Geological Survey who specializes in the Colorado River. The uncertainty has local, state and federal officials along the 1,450-mile river scurrying to secure water allotments while also preparing for the worst. Already in Las Vegas, the regional water agency is removing the equivalent of a football field of grass every day from front lawns, playgrounds and golf courses to save on outdoor watering. Farther downriver, Arizona officials are pumping billions of gallons of water into aquifers to save for an even less rainy day. Electricity has become a concern. The Western Area Power Administration, the federal agency that distributes power from hydroelectric projects in the Rocky Mountain West, plans to reduce by about 25 percent the amount of electricity it can promise in future years. Conserving on a Large Scale In Los Angeles, a representative from the West's largest urban water agency, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, is among a group of Western water officials dusting off plans to help limit evaporation from reservoirs, which could save billions of gallons. One idea is to pour a nontoxic substance over the reservoirs to form a water-trapping barrier. The group, which has been holding meetings, is even looking at far-off solutions like raising the height of Hoover Dam so that more water could be collected and saved during wet times. ''We understand we have a problem and we are working on it,'' said the Los Angeles representative, Dennis Underwood, a former head of the federal Bureau of Reclamation, which oversees dams and reservoirs in the West. There are also worries downstream from Powell at Lake Mead, which serves Nevada, Arizona and California. It could drop low enough as early as next year to force officials to declare a drought emergency. That would hurt the booming southern Nevada economy through significantly higher water rates and outright bans on things like new swimming pools, said Patricia Mulroy, general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority. Mr. Raley of the Interior Department said he wanted the states to consider a water bank, in which unused water could be leased or sold across state lines. Some previous efforts to create banks, with federal oversight, have been contentious because they were seen by smaller states as a means to funnel more of the river to water-guzzling California. But the notion of cutting private water deals on the Colorado is gaining broader acceptance, in large part because of the drought. The most celebrated example was a deal last year to sell irrigation water in the Imperial Valley of Southern California to the urban water district in San Diego. Some advocates for agriculture fear that water-to-the-highest-bidder could ravage ranches and farms if owners were induced to sell their irrigation rights. But private-market supporters say the truth, like it or not, is that farmers own most of the West's water, and ultimately there will be fewer of them. There is some concern that if the Colorado River goes into crisis, the ensuing tangle of litigation over water rights, endangered species and border disputes could undo the system of Western water law that has evolved over the last 100 years. Some say that would be a good thing. ''The law of the river is hopelessly, irretrievably obsolete, designed on a hydrological fallacy, around an agrarian West that no longer exists,'' Professor McCool at the University of Utah said. ''After six years of drought, somebody will have to say the emperor has no clothes.'' Water officials in Arizona and Nevada say they would also like to rethink the law of the river to put their states on a more equal footing in sharing the Colorado River. But Mr. Raley said such talk invites disaster and chaos, especially during a drought. ''This isn't the time to plunge into chaos,'' he said. Other people who live here on the fringe of Lake Powell say that the West's great reservoirs have, in their very decline, proved their value in stretching out limited water resources and underlined the difference between past civilizations here that anthropologists say were wiped out or displaced by drought. ''Those people back then had nothing to catch and save their water -- now we do,'' said Ronald W. Thompson, district manager of the Washington County Water Conservancy District in southwestern Utah. ''I'm a believer that history repeats itself -- long-term drought could return,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''But I suspect our civilization can weather this.'' Dry Spell Articles in this series will examine the effects of prolonged drought on states in the Colorado River basin."
"The Afghan farmers, coated in dust, some of them barefoot, wielded their hoes, not in the fields they are accustomed to, which lay barren, but at the bottom of a dried canal. ''For the last seven years there is no work, no water,'' said one old man, Muhammad Azam, after scrambling up a steep bank of crumbly soil to tell his lament. ''I am 70 years old. I did not eat at all this morning. We would die if it weren't for this work.'' The work is a canal-clearing project run by the United Nations World Food Program, and the farmers employed are among 6.4 million Afghan people who the agency estimates do not have enough to eat this year. Afghanistan remains in the grip of the most debilitating drought in living memory, now in its seventh year. Government and foreign aid officials warn that despite the outside help and a good harvest last year, the country is living on the brink, with nearly 40 percent of the population below subsistence levels. The World Food Program, which had hoped to reduce assistance, put out an appeal to donor countries in September to help Afghanistan through the winter until the harvest of 2005. The agency reports that districts in 17 provinces are in urgent need of help and that 37 percent of the population is unable to meet its basic needs. ''You have a recurring drought in Afghanistan, particularly because of deforestation and soil degradation,'' said Susana Rico, head of Word Food Program in Afghanistan. ''There is significant underlying poverty, and a significant portion of the population that are not able to feed themselves. Any shock will push more under the threshold.'' The shock this year was simply the lack of rain. Crops failed, farm laborers were left without work and food prices rose sharply, by 50 percent in some places. Wells, rivers and canals have gone dry. The World Food Program estimates that three quarters of a million people in the country are in ''severe distress'' because of an acute shortage of drinking water. At least 4,000 families -- 20,000 people -- have abandoned their homes in search of water and jobs, said the minister of rural rehabilitation and development, Hanif Atmar. ''These 4,000 families are known, but the real figure may be higher,'' he said. This province, Nimruz, in the far southwestern corner of Afghanistan, bordering Iran and Pakistan, is probably the worst affected area. The World Food Program estimates that 92 percent of the Nimruz's population -- 130,000 people -- needs food aid or other assistance. The great Helmand River, which descends from the Hindu Kush and, along with other rivers, feeds the traditional wetlands of the Sistan Basin, has run dry in Nimruz. A new bridge spanning the Helmand at Zaranj, at the border with Iran -- built by the Iranian government and officially opened in November -- crosses a dry river bed. ''For the last four or five years we have not had a drop in the river,'' said Hajji Qesim Khedri, the mayor of the provincial capital, Zaranj, as he stood on the bridge. ''We used to use boats, now we drive our cars in it.'' The province, once a cultural and rich agricultural center, is fed by the rivers that descend from the snowfields in Afghanistan's central highlands but the snow caps have shrunk to half their size and the rivers no longer reach the river basin in Nimruz. Annual rainfall, always low, was about 2 to 2.3 inches in Nimruz before the drought, but for the past three years it has been a little over a tenth of an inch, said Muhammad Akbar Sharifi, head of the government's Agriculture Department in Zaranj. Nearly all the wells in the province are salty. The desert is advancing and huge sand dunes have smothered up to 100 villages, many fields and orchards, and even parts of Zaranj. More than 90 percent of the animals have died or been slaughtered, Mr. Sharifi said. ''People are emigrating, the district bazaars are empty,'' he said. The 100 men, old and young, cleaning and deepening the canal at a section in Chakhansur, about 25 miles east of Zaranj, said they had not harvested their fields for seven years, and most families are surviving on bread. For the past two months, 500 men have been employed to clean the canal. Each family gets to work one eight-day stint a month and is paid with a bag of wheat weighing about 110 pounds, which can last a small family one month. ''This is not enough for us,'' a farmer named Malang, 46, said. ''The population is large and everyone is trying to get this job.'' Another man, Lashkaran, 60, a father of 10, said: ''We don't have pomegranates or vegetables, or water. We used to grow wheat, melons, vegetables. Without food, we will have to think of moving.'' The district center still has sweet water in its wells, but in the outlying villages, well water has turned brackish. Lashkaran said a cow he owned had gone blind from drinking the well water. Compounding the problem, Afghans who had sought refuge in Iran are returning in increasing numbers -- 35,000 in November alone, a local official said -- and are putting further stress on the province's scant resources. In the past two months, 900 refugees returned to Chakhansur, said the district chief, Muhammad Sarwar Naseri. Many are being pushed out by the Iranian authorities and, after 20 years in Iran, may not be able to survive back in their villages, officials and aid workers said. Nearly three decades of war and neglect have left Afghanistan ill prepared to cope with the unprecedented severity of the drought, officials say. A dam on the Helmand River that might have averted some of the crisis of the last seven years, the Kamal Khan dam, was started in the 1970's but never completed. Iran built a dam on its side and has been piping water, at a cost, back to Afghanistan. A comprehensive nationwide water management plan and major reforestation are essential if communities are to be saved, Ms. Rico said. In Zaranj, children cluster around public taps, filling plastic cans to load onto donkeys or push carts. Without this lifeline, though, the city would have been abandoned. The tiny hamlet of Khairabad, on the eastern edge of town, has a working well but is fighting the encroaching desert. Huge sand dunes have formed around the village, said Hajji Abdul Karim, the local leader. Some have swept into abandoned houses, blocking the doorways. A north wind blows for most of the summer months, creating terrible sandstorms that shift the dunes in a matter of hours, the villagers said. ''They are hoping God will make the rain come,'' said Abdul Karim Barawi, the governor of Nimruz, of his people. In the more populous province of Kandahar, fabled for its 18 varieties of grapes and flavorful, deep red pomegranates, even more people are affected -- more than 400,000 by World Food Program estimates. Farmers have been uprooting their vines and pomegranate trees to sell for firewood after repeated failed harvests. ''I'm taking it out. Our trees have died. There's no water,'' said Janan, 35, as he hacked at the roots of a dead pomegranate tree. His father, Hajji Azimullah, 55, picked a stunted pomegranate from the tree and crumbled it in his hands. ''It is sad but we have to eat,'' he said. ''This place had very beautiful pomegranates. Your thirst would be quenched and your stomach would be full by just one pomegranate. Next year, if there is no rain, we will die. If God wills, it will rain.''"
