"Against the musical backdrop of masons' hammers everywhere clink-clinking on brick, Dr. Derek Booth, a geologist at the University of Washington, is driving through West Seattle pointing out the curious excess of chimneys damaged here in last month's earthquake. Cruising past the modest bungalows and ranch homes, he points to a chimney with a stair-step crack down its bricks, another cockeyed from twisting and many others beheaded at the roofline. Geologists have, in fact, been fascinated by the tumbling chimneys of West Seattle since they first fell like rain in the 1965 earthquake. Scientists asked, Did this working-class enclave shake more violently than everywhere else? Did contractors erect particularly shoddy chimneys or is there some other as yet unfathomed explanation? Now a new survey of 50,000 to 60,000 chimneys in the Puget Sound area may, at last, have identified the true culprit: the infamous Seattle fault zone. Scientists note that this complex of faults, running east-west beneath the city and beyond, did not move during the recent Nisqually earthquake. Instead, they say, the fault zone appears to have focused shaking from the quake, creating a zone of intensified destruction above itself -- through West Seattle and west to Bremerton and east to Beacon Hill. ''It's a surprise,'' said Dr. Booth, adding that while the fault zone remains by far the leading contender, researchers are continuing to test for other possible explanations for the pattern of damage. ''Nobody expected to see any association with the Seattle fault zone.'' With the survey of chimneys completed just this week, the team of 12 researchers headed up by Dr. Booth and Dr. Ray Wells, a geologist with the United States Geological Survey, will present their findings at the annual meeting of the Seismological Society of America next month in San Francisco. Researchers said the new work would be of particular interest as the latest evidence indicating that faults can focus shaking to produce concentrated damage in unexpected locations, sometimes far from where the quake originated. In addition, the line of damage mapped so neatly over the Seattle fault zone that researchers are now surveying chimneys in hope of mapping the Olympia fault, whose boundaries are poorly known. To measure shaking from temblors, researchers typically use carefully calibrated and highly sensitive seismometers. But such instruments are expensive and deployed in limited numbers, making their measurements precise but few and far between. ''The seismologists have a lot on us,'' said Dr. Booth of researchers using such high-tech devices. ''But we've got 60,000 chimneys. That's the one thing we've got on them.'' Chimneys are also among the first things to fail in a quake and are easily seen from the road, making them ideal, if informal, monitors of shaking. To take advantage of these brick-and-mortar seismometers, researchers from the University of Washington, the Geological Survey and Western Washington University drove through Seattle as well as areas outside the city. When they spotted damaged or downed chimneys, they tallied the victims, their injuries and recorded their locations. The researchers found some 1,500 damaged chimneys, mostly in a distinctive east-west band atop the Seattle fault zone. In West Seattle the damage was so localized that the worst of it could be seen in the blocks coming off Hanford Street, which runs east-west. Dr. Wells said the team looked for other explanations for the pattern like changes in the rock types or topology but found none. ''It seems to cut across different architectural styles,'' he said. ''They're just all brick chimneys.'' But the fault zone can't explain all the damage. The Madrona neighborhood and an area southeast of Green Lake -- both away from the fault zone -- also had concentrations of damage, but less severe. Researchers say they do not yet know why. For residents hoping to gauge future threats, learning the cause may be less important than the fact that the damage is so strikingly predictable. ''These chimneys are a pretty good way to figure out in future earthquakes what's going to shake the hardest and where the damage might be focused,'' said Dr. Tom Brocher, a geophysicist with the Geological Survey who was not involved in the research. ''It's telling us to pay attention to this area in the future.'' Dr. Booth said the hardest-hit blocks in West Seattle were the same in the Feb. 28 quake as they were in 1965's. Even the same parts of the same houses felt the same stresses. Karen Witheril said she moved into her home in West Seattle not long after the 1965 quake. ''We'd seen damage in the plaster,'' said Mrs. Witheril, pointing out the hairline fractures in the living room and hallway as masons dismantled her chimney outside. ''That's where the cracks were again this time.'' Scientists say it is still unclear how the Seattle fault zone might be focusing shaking. In the most simplistic sense, researchers expect to see the greatest damage nearest to where an earthquake originates. But in Kobe, Japan, and Northridge, Calif., researchers found zones of intense damage away from the origin of the quake suggesting that seismic waves were not simply heading up and away from the faults from which they came. Instead, according to Dr. Robert Graves, a seismologist at the engineering company URS Corporation, one theory suggests that seismic waves can bounce or have their path of movement bent like a ray of refracted light when they hit a structure like a fault. That could potentially result in redirected waves piling up in unexpected locations and causing increased shaking -- as in West Seattle. But whether such mechanisms are at work remains to be seen. ''Now we have a chance to test this model with the new earthquake,'' said Dr. Graves. But geologists are not the only people whose careers have been enriched by the ruined chimneys. ''A whole lot of chimneys shook,'' said Bill Murdock, a mason with All Masonry & Construction, who was knocking down a cracked chimney two blocks from Hanford Street. When asked how long a homeowner would have to wait to get a chimney fixed these days, he looked down from his scaffolding and laughed. ''We've got so much work, we're backed up for months.''"
"Shocking Events Q. How do scientists distinguish between aftershocks and new earthquakes? I understand that aftershocks can sometimes occur years after the original quake. A. It is partly a matter of definition, based on the sequence of events and on the magnitude readings and other accumulated data about a given large seismic event. Seismologists define not only aftershocks but also foreshocks, tremors that are related to a major event but precede it. ''Foreshock'' and ''aftershock'' are relative terms, the United States Geological Survey emphasizes. In the agency's educational materials, foreshocks are described as earthquakes that precede larger earthquakes in the same location, and aftershocks as smaller earthquakes that occur in the same general area days to years after a larger event or ''main shock'' and in the span of time before the level of seismic activity returns to the normal or ''background'' range. The ''general area'' differs from fault to fault and is defined as being within one to two fault-lengths away. Aftershocks represent minor readjustments along the portion of a fault that slipped during the main shock, the survey explains. The frequency of these aftershocks decreases with time. Historically, the survey notes, deep earthquakes are much less likely to be followed by aftershocks than are shallow earthquakes. C. CLAIBORNE RAY"
"As if things were not worrisome enough, nature decided to take a swipe of its own at New York. A small earthquake rumbled through the city early yesterday morning, inflicting little damage but further fraying the nerves of an already high-strung citizenry. While many people slept undisturbed through the jiggling, some New Yorkers felt their beds shake. Pictures fell off walls. Glass and china smashed onto the floor. Some people woke in alarm, and in these everything-is-possible days, their first thought was that bombs were being dropped on the city. ''The first thing I thought was, 'Oh no, it's terrorist attacks,' '' said Kumar Rai, 35, an employee at Unlimited Donuts in Long Island City, Queens. When he found out it was an earthquake, itself hardly a calming event, he immediately relaxed. ''It was a relief, a very big relief,'' he said. ''An earthquake is a natural thing. But terrorism, that is a human thing. Human beings can be worse than nature.'' Many other people said that they were frightened for a few seconds, but that once it dawned on them what it was, they quickly felt better. Only in these teeth-chattering days could an earthquake become a soothing event. The earthquake, which occurred at 1:42 a.m., had a preliminary magnitude of 2.6, making it a minor quake. ''The official category is 'very minor,' '' said John Bellini, a geophysicist at the United States Geological Survey. ''It doesn't even make the minor category.'' He said the epicenter was on the East Side of Manhattan, just north of the Queensboro Bridge. The movement of the earth was felt throughout Manhattan, as well as in Brooklyn, Queens, part of New Jersey and Long Island. The police said that recovery and excavation work at the World Trade Center site was unaffected and continued uninterrupted. Mr. Bellini said the collapse of the trade center would not have in any way precipitated yesterday's quake. There were no immediate reports of any injuries or significant damage, and Mr. Bellini said an earthquake of such modest size does not cause damage. An earthquake of similar magnitude struck the city on Jan. 17, also doing little more than shaking up some people. Geophysicists said it was commonplace for minor tremors to occur somewhere in the metropolitan area each year as a result of normal shifts of the earth's plates. Given the hour that yesterday's earthquake rattled the streets, many people were asleep and never noticed it. Some of them refused to believe it had even happened. Yet in Long Island City, a number of people very much felt the movement and dashed out of their apartment buildings and businesses. They looked fretfully toward the sky, fearing missiles were being fired upon the city. Jose Balle, 28, of Long Island City, was unnerved enough that even hours after the earthquake, he still had a splitting headache. ''All the noise and stuff, it sounds too strong,'' he said. ''I still feel like I'm shaking. My head is going bang, bang, bang.'' In Astoria, Queens, drowsy residents scampered out of their homes in their pajamas. Some people reported lamps and china breaking. A few people, already beset by severe anxiety, went to friends' apartments for comfort. Police officers reported that they were approached by many wide-eyed residents wondering whether a new wave of terrorist attacks had begun. Emergency calls came in, reporting that buildings were quivering and that people had heard a booming sound. Workers at the Queensboro Plaza subway station said they assumed the shaking was because of a car accident on Queens Plaza. They were surprised to hear that there had, in fact, been an earthquake. Because it was the weekend, many New Yorkers were at clubs and found it hard to discriminate between the vibrations from loud music and the onset of an earthquake. A group of teenagers from New Jersey who were visiting Lower Manhattan said they had been at a number of clubs that were bouncing so much on their own that even a larger earthquake might have passed unnoticed. ''The earth's been quaking where I've been tonight,'' said a man walking with a friend on the Upper East Side after a night of good times. ''But I don't know anything about an earthquake.'' Sitting in his home in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Mike Watanabe was playing Red Fraction, an action video game punctuated with gunfire and explosions. Suddenly, he felt his house tremble. He hurried outside. He said he expected to find that a tractor-trailer had plowed into the side of his house. There was nothing. Learning that it was an earthquake, he shrugged it off."
"After days of torrential rains, floods and landslides poured down mountainsides early this morning on Nias, an Indonesian island 60 miles off the coast of Sumatra, sweeping away entire villages and causing at least 60 deaths, local officials said. Hundreds more people were reported missing in the deluge that engulfed the tiny island, where surfers from around the world gather for the long breakers but where mountain settlements are cut off from the outside. Officials said they were beginning search and rescue missions despite the winds and high seas. The island, home to 600,000 people, has only a tiny airstrip and is eight hours away by boat from Sumatra island, in northwestern Indonesia. Officials said about 50 surfers were on Nias at the time but were in an area that was not affected by the flooding. The disaster was the latest in a rising number of flash floods around Indonesia and elsewhere, where uncontrolled logging has stripped mountainsides of the vegetation that holds rainfall and the earth itself. There were fears that the flood on Nias had carried many bodies out to sea and that the death toll could rise far higher. Rescuers held out hope that some of the missing had found refuge on higher ground. According to local reports, the worst-hit village was Sambulu, where a torrent of mud destroyed at least 103 houses in the predawn hours, a local official said. Portions of the village were reported to remain under water today. Although most of Indonesia is in the midst of its annual dry season, the floods came after days of heavy rains that had drenched the area. In addition, two earthquakes, measuring between 5.3 and 5.4 magnitude were recorded near Nias island on Tuesday, though it was not clear whether they had contributed to the disaster. It was not immediately clear whether deforestation was the cause of the Nias floods as it has been for others where a rise in deaths has been recorded in recent years. But in a study this year, Indonesia's largest environmental group, Walhi, found that a surge of flash floods early in the year coincided exactly with areas that have suffered the highest levels of deforestation. ''So it's really a sign of the environmental destruction of Indonesia,'' said Longgena Ginting, the campaign director of Walhi. ''Deforestation has become a serious problem, along with bad forest management.'' Similar cases of flash floods caused by deforestation have raised environmental and public safety concerns around Asia, including in China, Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia. Much of the problem is caused by illegal logging, one symptom of economic hardship, Mr. Ginting said. ''Seven out of 10 logs in Indonesia are illegally cut,'' he said. The country needs 100 million cubic meters of logs a year, with only 25 million cubic meters being felled legally. ''The problem has spread out all over Indonesia and, sadly, has already entered conservation areas -- national parks and protected forests,'' he said. ''No single national forest is secure from illegal logging activity now.' The island of Nias offers a juxtaposition of the modern and traditional worlds, with surfers gathering at beach resorts not far from villages that have only begun to emerge from the past. Some older villagers can still remember the days of headhunting and slavery on an island so isolated that it called itself Land of Mankind. But its attraction to surfers has brought a taste of modernity, including a Web site (www.niasisland.com). At the same time, an Australian surfing magazine describes Nias as having ''one of the best righthanders in Indonesia,'' referring to how the waves break over the reef, as well as ''an excellent left reef break that works well over four foot.''"
"Five strong earthquakes have shaken India in the last decade, and new evidence has convinced scientists that much worse appears not only inevitable, but overdue. An analysis of the shifting subcontinent found enormous pent-up strain along most of the 1,200-mile arc where it slides under the Himalayas and the Tibetan plateau beyond. The researchers say there is abundant evidence that such pressures have been relieved in the past only through great earthquakes far more powerful than the one that devastated the western city of Bhuj in January, killing 20,000 people. More than 800 miles of the 1,200-mile-long mountain range and the crowded plains to the south constitute ''a catastrophe zone'' that is ''ripe, mature, and ready to go,'' said Dr. Roger G. Bilham, a geologist at the University of Colorado and an author of the new study, which is described in the current issue of Science. Dr. Bilham said the pressures in the subterranean rock, and thus the power of resulting earthquakes, would only continue to build as the vast land mass inexorably pushes into Asia -- shifting six and a half feet every century. ''If it doesn't go now,'' he said, ''it'll be worse when it does.'' The region at greatest risk includes the crowded Ganges plain and the capitals of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, the study said. The earthquake that struck Bhuj in January was also caused by the subcontinent's movement, the researchers said, but did nothing to relieve the pressure points hundreds of miles to the north and east that could produce more potent shocks. Over the last few decades, government planners and geologists in India and in neighboring countries have debated the risks near the Himalayas, where India has invested heavily in hydroelectric dams and where many city populations have grown tremendously. Many new, tall buildings lack the reinforcement necessary to withstand big jolts, said Dr. Brian E. Tucker, a seismologist and the president of Geohazards International, a nonprofit group in Palo Alto, Calif., that aims to help developing countries cut earthquake death rates. Dr. Tucker said a study of Katmandu, conducted with Nepali scientists, estimated that a great quake, of magnitude 8 or more, would kill 40,000 people and seriously injure 100,000. ''Hopefully this study will help motivate the government and private sector to launch efforts to mitigate the risk,'' Dr. Tucker said. The increased confidence in the earthquake predictions comes from much finer measurements of land movements made using Global Positioning System measurements and a new review of historical records. The historical records point to long gaps along the mountain range where there is no evidence of great earthquakes for several centuries. Each century without an earthquake translates into more than six feet of deeply buried crust jammed up and stuck as it presses under the Himalayas -- ''like mail stuffed under a door,'' said Dr. Peter Molnar, a University of Colorado geologist and an author of the paper. The other author was Dr. Vinod K. Gaur, a seismologist at the Indian Institute for Astrophysics. Sooner or later, the jammed spots will become unstuck, and the result, Dr. Molnar said, has always been -- and will always be -- calamity. ''The Bhuj earthquake was damaging,'' he said, ''but wake up, guys, that's small peanuts compared to what's likely to happen.''"
"How DNA Can Aid Fish In recent years, DNA fingerprinting has become an important tool for law enforcement agents to solve crimes. But DNA analysis is also used by those who study animals -- to help distinguish one closely related species from another, for example, or to study the genetic similarities among members of a threatened species. Scientists from Denmark and Germany have now put two and two together, using DNA analysis of an animal with a view to solving human crimes. Specifically, they have used genetic testing of cod, a fish that is severely depleted in many fishing grounds, to identify where individual fish come from. Such testing may someday help stop poaching. The scientists determined that there were distinguishable genetic differences in cod from three areas -- the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the northeastern Arctic Ocean. In fact, the researchers report in Nature, testing of just two or three fish is enough to determine which of those three fishing regions each comes from. Cod populations in these three areas are severely threatened, and the amount of fishing is regulated by international conventions. DNA analysis of cod samples obtained on the docks or in the marketplace could tell whether the fish were obtained unlawfully from these protected areas. The researchers added that the technique could easily be expanded to other cod populations (like those in the northwestern Atlantic, which are also under pressure) and to other fish as well. Finding a Swiss Fault As earthquakes go, the one that struck Basel, Switzerland, on Oct. 18, 1356, has been largely forgotten. But it was one of the most devastating quakes ever to hit Europe, destroying dozens of castles and killing thousands of people. Seismologists haven't forgotten the quake, however, and have been trying for years to determine its cause, with little luck. But now, using ground-penetrating radar and other tools, researchers from the University of Basel and from the University of Strasbourg in France have found the culprit -- a fault that lies just south of Basel and extends at least five miles. It is marked at the surface by a fault scarp, a small ridge. While finding the cause of an earthquake that happened 645 years ago is a significant achievement, more important is what the researchers have learned about current conditions. The fault, they report in the journal Science, is still active, and has the potential to cause another strong earthquake sometime in the next 1,000 to 2,000 years. Since Basel is surrounded by a lot more than just castles now -- it is a major center for the nuclear and chemical industries, for example -- a quake could result in widespread devastation. Controlled Burns' Costs Prescribed burning of forests in parts of the East is seen by some forestry experts as a way to restore the once-mighty oak to its position of dominance. Because of efforts to suppress fires since the 1940's, shade-loving trees like maples and poplars have taken over many forests. Oaks, which are fire-resistant and in the past would outlast other trees through the natural cycles of fire and regrowth, have declined. While restoring oaks would no doubt have beneficial effects -- among other things, their acorns are food for many animals -- prescribed fires may harm other species. As a case in point, a scientist from Ohio State University and colleagues have shown the effects of controlled fires on ground-nesting birds. The scientists, who reported on their work in the journal Conservation Biology, studied forests in southern Ohio where prescribed burns have taken place for several years. They found that three species of songbirds, including two types of warblers, declined by more than 80 percent compared with those in unburned areas. They attributed the declines to the loss of shrubs for nesting, to the drying of moist nesting sites and to the loss of leaf litter that the birds use to build their homes. Observatory"
"SHORTLY after the planes slammed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon last week, a reporter called to ask, ''What effect will the terrorist attacks have on the economy?'' ''That's the least of it,'' I replied. How can one even begin to consider the economic costs before the human toll is known? The reporter sheepishly confessed that his assignment was to cover ''the least of it.'' Indeed, he himself was supposed to have been covering a conference in the World Trade Center that fateful morning and was lucky to have overslept and missed it. In the aftermath of the tragedies of Sept. 11, I find myself compelled to address ''the least of it'' as well. Economists try to answer questions like this by looking at past experiences and relying on theoretical reasoning. Though there is nothing like these monstrous attacks to draw on, experiences with natural disasters might provide clues. Most research finds that natural disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes have a relatively small impact on the economy. George Horwitch, a Purdue economist, provides a striking example in a recent study of the earthquake that struck Kobe, Japan, in January 1995, the most destructive ever in a modern city. Some 100,000 buildings were destroyed, and 250,000 damaged. More than 300,000 people became homeless, and 6,500 lost their lives. Yet within 15 months manufacturing output returned to 98 percent of its pre-earthquake trend level. By July 1996, all department stores and 79 percent of small shops had reopened. Investment boomed. Similar stories can be told about Hurricanes Andrew and Hugo and other natural disasters. Even the severe bombing of German cities in World War II did not deter growth after the bombing stopped. German output grew 148 percent from 1947 to 1955, and well surpassed its prewar level. Some disasters, however, have caused lasting economic damage. For example, Newark never fully recovered from the riots of the 1960's. The rioting and the looting are believed to have undermined faith in the government and market there; by contrast, the terrorist attacks seem to have strengthened Americans' resolve to work together and trust their system and public servants. The conventional wisdom is that disasters, natural and otherwise, typically have only a modest effect on economic activity because human capital -- the knowledge and skills embodied in the citizenry -- survives intact. In modern economies, human capital accounts for as much as 70 percent of national income. Buildings and machines can be rebuilt, debris can be swept up; the key to production is people and human knowledge and skill, and a system that allows resources to be put to maximal use. The economic costs are also dampened because output, including services, can be produced using different combinations of resources. Financial firms, for example, are cleverly finding new sources of office space, including hotels. Some economists have predicted that the tragic events in New York and Washington could possibly do some economic good by stimulating investment and unlocking the Social Security lockbox. But there is something profoundly wrong with the way we measure economic well-being if this tragedy leads to the conclusion that some economic good was achieved. Pain and suffering do not enter into national income statistics; destroyed buildings do not subtract from the gross domestic product; and the option of tapping the budget surplus was always available. If the conventional wisdom is correct, the terrorist attacks -- horrific as they were -- are unlikely to knock economic production far off track a year from now. The conventional wisdom might not be the end of the story, however. James R. Hines Jr. and Christian Jaramillo of the University of Michigan are studying the effects on economic growth of 728 earthquakes in 97 countries in the postwar period. Their results suggest that although severe natural disasters do not affect short-term growth, they do reduce G.D.P. around 2 percent three years later. The reason is that after the investment boom subsides, the capital stock is still less than it otherwise would have been. In addition, disorganization and government missteps in reaction to disasters can curb longer-term growth. Of course, the economy was already teetering on the brink of recession before the attacks. G.D.P. grew at a 0.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter of 2001, down from 5.7 percent a year earlier. But focusing on whether the economy crosses a line into a recession -- which is just an arbitrary threshold -- misses the point that the reaction to the tragedy could affect the longer-term level of economic activity more than the direct effect of the destruction wrought by the attacks, and ignores the fact that economic well-being depends on much more than the G.D.P. There is a limit to how much one can extrapolate from past disasters to the current situation. The impact of this tragedy would seem to depend on repercussions from at least three factors that cannot be predicted with any confidence. The first is consumer behavior. Frankly, economists were already puzzled why consumer spending was so strong in recent months despite the stock market decline. Consumer confidence could plummet, dragging consumer spending down with it. Because consumer spending represents two-thirds of G.D.P., just a 3 percent drop in consumption this quarter would cause growth to contract at an 8 percent annual rate. Second, the government's response is unknown, and the response to the government's response is also unknown. A war, if it occurs, could raise the price of oil and weaken the economy, as it did during the Persian Gulf war. Even without a war, a large call-up of reserves could disrupt civilian production. It is also possible that the United States would turn inward and restrict trade and immigration. Third, failures in leading industries, like finance and transportation, could impair the economy. These industries are critical because they facilitate trade and investment in other sectors. Although the financial markets are functioning and most financial firms are back on their feet, many airlines face the risk of insolvency. The concrete forecasts of economic recovery or decline proffered by pundits stand in sharp contrast to the cautious and deliberate approach exercised by public officials in determining the casualties and perpetrators of this heinous crime. For now, the economic watchword should be uncertainty. And uncertainty itself is usually not good for the economy. Economic Scene Alan B.

"The crash of two planes into the World Trade Center and the collapses of the towers created shock waves that registered on sensitive instruments meant to monitor earthquakes. In destructive energy, the building collapses were slightly larger than the small earthquake that shook the East Side of Manhattan on Jan. 17, scientists said yesterday. ''It was pretty good sized,'' said Lynn R. Sykes, a seismologist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, which tracks global earthquakes from its base 10 miles north of Manhattan. Scientists at Lamont were watching news of the crashes on television when their seismographs began to jump. ''I just cried,'' said Won-Young Kim, the scientist in charge of monitoring quakes in the Northeast, knowing that the sensors were registering more than just the force of falling concrete. The seismographs also recorded the impacts of the airplanes, the first at 8:46 a.m. and the second at 9:03 a.m., Dr. Sykes said. The tower collapses, he added, came at 9:59 and 10:28 a.m. The destructive energy of the January earthquake was magnitude 2.4, a minor earthquake. It was felt in Manhattan and Queens. Dr. Sykes said the twin tower collapses were slightly larger in destructive energy. (The collapse hours later of a much shorter building, 7 World Trade Center, did not register in initial seismograph readings, scientists said.) A DAY OF TERROR: THE MEASUREMENT"
"Three months after the devastating earthquake leveled every house in this mountain village in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, the newlyweds Zaheer and Shazia found themselves sleeping once more in the open, this time in the snow. Their cotton tent had collapsed on top of them in the night under a heavy snowfall, so for four nights, they huddled in the open on a rope bed by a fire. ''It was very cold, the snow fell on our faces,'' said Shazia, 19, with a shy smile. ''We need a shelter, food rations and bedding.'' Despite an enormous aid effort over the three months since the Oct. 8 earthquake, rescue workers are still finding new villages in need of the most basic assistance to hope to survive the harsh winter snows. Two heavy snowfalls in the last month have hampered the relief operation and tested the population of this mountainous area, still traumatized by the quake, which killed 73,338 people, seriously injured 69,000 and left an estimated 2.5 million homeless. ''We are very worried and are being very vigilant,'' said Jan Vandemoortele, coordinator chief of the United Nations mission in Pakistan, which is working with the Pakistani government in the relief effort. A long spell of very cold weather could imperil many lives, he said. ''We are aware that the weather could blow us off in a day,'' he said. ''We cannot let our heads rest until the spring.'' Only a tiny proportion of the homeless moved to unaffected cities to rent accommodations or stay with relatives. Nearly 2 million are living in tents in the valleys and can expect two more months of freezing temperatures, Mr. Vandemoortele said, while some 400,000 people remain above the snowline, cut off by snow and landslides and surviving on airlifts of food and other supplies. Of the 860,000 tents distributed in the rush after the earthquake, only 30,000 were adequate for winter conditions, said Maj. Gen. Farooq Ahmad Khan, Pakistan's federal relief commissioner. When the first snow came at the start of the year, reports flooded in of tents collapsing, and of some burning down when people tried to heat them. A second round of supplies was needed, of plastic sheeting, corrugated metal roofing and tools, to help villagers build better shelters that could be heated, he said. The cold weather has brought a rise in acute respiratory infections -- pneumonia in the worst form -- which are now the main cause of deaths recorded by health officials. Families have been struggling into the towns after desperate journeys through the snow to seek assistance after their makeshift homes or tents collapsed in the latest heavy snowfall. Yet the relief effort, now in full swing, seems to be winning against the formidable obstacles in one of the most inaccessible disaster areas aid workers have seen. Helicopters -- American Chinooks, Pakistani military aircraft and white-painted aircraft chartered by the United Nations and other organizations -- ply the skies incessantly to funnel relief supplies into the mountains. Colored tents dot the hillsides and camps spill over and around the main towns. ''Thank God, in the two bad spells of weather, there has been no panic among the 3.5 million affected,'' General Farooq said, adding into the count the many villages that survived the quake but have been cut off by landslides. The airlifts of food and shelter materials gave people the confidence that they could survive, and there has not been a large movement of people down to the towns, he said. The region has also avoided any major epidemics so far. An outbreak of cholera was quickly scotched in a camp in Muzaffarabad in November, according to Sacha Bootsma, spokeswoman for the World Health Organization in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. The increase in acute respiratory infections, which amount to 30 percent of all medical consultations, she described as ''definitely a concern,'' but so far there had been no health catastrophe. Teams of Cuban and Pakistani doctors are trekking and flying into remote villages. The first priority in the relief effort was to supply those stranded at higher elevations before the winter closed in, but aid workers are still finding families and whole villages that have not received any aid. Shawn Pomeroy, a Canadian mountain climber working for the International Organization for Migration, which has overall responsibility for the shelter program, made the six-hour hike up from the town of Muzaffarabad last week and found the surviving villagers of Qaziabad, 6,000 feet above sea level, camping out. ''They had not received anything to date,'' he said. ''We are still filling pockets that missed out in the distribution.'' He found more than 400 families in Qaziabad, surviving with cotton tents they had collected from the town below. Some had plastic sheeting to put over the tents, but the village had not received a single airdrop of food or supplies, he said. The road had been cut since the earthquake, and the footpath was treacherous from continuing landslides, he said. Still, he said, the aid effort is making strides. ''It was overwhelming to begin with, the size of the disaster, but we are winning,'' he said. But for many of the inhabitants of the earthquake area, the nightmare has not abated. Their faces no longer show the shock so evident in the days immediately after the quake, but fear and uncertainty remains. Villagers in Qaziabad said 250 people had died there and in surrounding hamlets in the earthquake. ''The children wake up at night -- they are scared of being buried,'' said Rashida, mother of eight, as she tended a fire in the tiny mud hut her husband had fashioned from the rubble of their home. Her 12-year-old daughter, Maria, who was buried in the rubble of her school by the earthquake but was pulled out unharmed, sat silently beside her. Her 12-year-old son, Talbir, said, ''I am scared to sleep in a tent and scared to sleep inside.'' Farther west in the town of Balakot, which was severely damaged in the earthquake, several families a day have been trickling in after trekking down from remote snowbound Kaghan Valley. ''We had so many difficulties, and then we had this snowfall,'' said Muhammad Asif, 21, who arrived a week ago with his wife, parents and brothers. They took turns carrying his two Asif boys, 2 and 4, for two days through knee-deep snow. ''We had no tent, just a tarpaulin,'' he said. ''My plan was to stay up there, but the snow was too much.'' ''I am frightened of the mountain,'' he added. ''When the snow started, the landslides started again, so we came here,'' said his mother, Bibi Sarwar Jan. ''The helicopters stopped also with the snow, and we had no more food.'' Many of the mountainsides are still unstable, and landslides have worsened with the recent snow and rain, villagers and aid officials said. Roads cleared by the Pakistani Army in the last two months have been blocked again, and supply trucks have not been able to get more than a few miles outside the main towns. Sajjad, 27, walked five hours from his village, Nuri, in the Kaghan Valley, with his four young children, his wife carrying the youngest, 2 1/2-month-old Waqas. He had built a wooden shack and covered it with plastic after the quake, but it had collapsed on the family one morning after a heavy snowfall. They are also running low on food, he said. ''No helicopters came to our village,'' he said. ''We were living on our own food supplies. Helicopters landed at a nearby village, but the villagers there would push us away.'' Worst of all, the land was unstable, he said. ''Now there is a big danger of another landslide, and our land is threatened,'' he said. ''Lots of boulders are coming down, especially when it rains or snows.'' On a warm, sunny day in Balakot, life can seem just bearable. Survivors of the quake are out picking over the rubble of their houses, breaking up concrete and salvaging wood and scrap metal. But when the weather turns, as it did one recent evening, and wind and rain start to lash the tented camps and the acres of rubble, the misery of life in the disaster zone is all too clear. Ignoring the rain, Muhammad Owais Khan, 19, who lost his mother, father, younger brother, grandmother, aunt and his 10-year-old cousin when their house collapsed that October morning, stood looking through a family photo album he had just found in the wreckage of his home. ''That's my father on his wedding day,'' he said, pointing to a man in a white suit, garlands of tinsel around his neck. ''And that's my mother,'' he said, flicking to a page of a woman in gold ornaments and red silk veil. He had also just found the family Koran in the rubble, and had wrapped it carefully and stowed it with other belongings in a tent he had set up. Then he carried over parts of a smashed washing machine. ''I feel very bad,'' he said in English, looking around at the destruction. The government had given every family $438, but it was not even enough to remove the first layer of concrete from the wreckage of his home, he said. ''Five thousand people lived up on this hill, and 70 percent were killed,'' he said. They had pulled his 6-month-old cousin from his dead mother's arms, after hearing him cry for two days, he said. His three sisters and uncle survived and are living together in rented accommodations in the nearby town of Mansehra, he said. They could never live again on the hilltop, but would rebuild on land below, he said. ''We will come back after this crushing blow,'' he said. ''We will come back. My parents are buried here.''"
"SOON after Oct. 17, 1989, I stood on a hill in San Francisco, watching as my apartment and all my worldly possessions burned to the ground in the aftermath of the Loma Prieta earthquake. A photographer had already captured me for posterity, sobbing as I saw the smoldering rubble of my building for the first time, and for a while, photographers seemed to attend my and my neighbors' every move, whether we were scavenging the remains of our building or waiting in Red Cross lines. The earthquake had effectively wiped away our collective history, but at times I had the weird sense that another sort of history had sprung to life. Our travails seemed to parallel events that I had seen many times before, in photographs of the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906. As it turns out, my sense of déj_ vu was right: that quake, a 7.8 temblor that left the city burning for four days, is considered to have been the world's first widely photographed disaster. Throughout 2006, Bay Area organizations will be observing the event's April 18 centennial. (For a complete list, see 1906centennial.org.) One of the most interesting so far is ''1906 Earthquake: A Disaster in Pictures,'' at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art through May 30. Using more than 100 images, it demonstrates the many different types of photographs in production at the time -- including aerial panoramas, 3-D stereoview double-images to be viewed through a stereoscope, glass lantern slides intended to be projected before an audience and chromolithographic postcards. What's surprising is how much these pictures have in common with the documentation of more contemporary disasters, from the fall of the World Trade Center to Hurricane Katrina. Before the San Francisco quake, the nation had endured other cataclysmic events, like the Chicago fire of 1871, the Galveston flood of 1900 and the Baltimore fire of 1904. But ''none of them seems to have been photographed as much as this one,'' said Corey Keller, curator of ''1906 Earthquake,'' ''and I think that has to do with the historical moment in photographic technology.'' By 1906, roll film that could be loaded in daylight had made cameras increasingly portable and easy to use, and the Bay Area itself was densely populated with professional photographers. After gold was discovered in the Sierras in 1848, they had flocked there to photograph the miners; many, like Carleton Watkins and Eadweard Muybridge, stayed on to record the natural wonders of Yosemite and the man-made wonders of San Francisco, an overnight boom town built with Gold Rush money. As with contemporary disasters, many of the most arresting images of the quake were made by local photographers, like the Philadelphia transplant Willard E. Worden and the German-born Arnold Genthe, who were on the scene when the earthquake struck. Among Worden's many lusciously smoke-filled images is ''California Street Afire'' (1906), which shows firemen standing alongside a tiny, toylike pump, helpless before the raging flames. (Presumably, he shot the photograph after the water mains broke.) Genthe, who like many other photographers lost his studio and archives during the quake, seems to have focused on the more than 200,000 people it displaced. Many of his untitled prints and glass lantern slides show them waiting -- huddled in white-tented refugee camps, waiting in lines outside the few remaining stores, gazing at ruined buildings. One of his best-known images in ''1906 Earthquake'' shows two women incongruously laughing atop Telegraph Hill, as smoke billows up behind them. (This and another Genthe image -- the only one in the show to depict African-Americans -- are modern prints made from the photographer's own negatives.) Because the earthquake provided a perfect opportunity for demonstrating technological marvels, it attracted many photographic entrepreneurs. Arthur C. Pillsbury, who had invented a circuit panoramic camera while studying mechanical engineering at nearby Stanford University, was able to shoot the dramatic panoramas that got the San Francisco-based Pillsbury Picture Company, his fledgling photography concern, off the ground. The aerial photography pioneer George R. Lawrence hustled out from Chicago with his Captive Airship -- a 49-pound panoramic camera borne aloft by a group of kites. The three spectacular Lawrence panoramas on view, each titled ''Photograph of San Francisco in Ruins,'' proved the making of his company, whose motto was ''The Hitherto Impossible Is Our Specialty.'' (One image is said to have earned him $15,000, a fortune at the time.) In 1906, too, the world was full of photographic publishing houses -- the network broadcasters of their day -- which specialized in satisfying the ever-growing demand for exotic images from far-off lands. Views of San Francisco were already popular; in 1856, the city became the subject of the first known city-themed photo book, George Robinson Fardon's ''San Francisco Album.'' Many of the major East Coast houses, like Underwood & Underwood, Griffith & Griffith and H. C. White, swiftly produced earthquake-themed stereoviews, while others published panoramas and quickie photo albums. As Ms. Keller noted, ''Photography offered a lot of new ways to cater to that eternal taste for sensationalism.'' What's striking about the commercially produced photographs in the show is that so many of them tend to focus on exactly the same scenes -- like the flaming shell of the domed Call Building, the first skyscraper in the West. Another popular subject was the ruins of the Towne Mansion on Nob Hill, whose portals framed a vista of fallen buildings. Many of the images, as Ms. Keller pointed out, suggest classical ruins. Because San Francisco had been chockablock with Beaux-Arts architecture, such allusions make visual sense. But by invoking ''a more noble idea of a fallen civilization,'' Ms. Keller said, the images also managed to create ''an instant historical mystique for a city that was only 50 years old.'' Many of the most photographed sites assumed a symbolic status. The rubble of City Hall came to suggest corruption. But because it survived intact, the steel frame of the Whittell Building, then under construction near Union Square (where it still stands), turned up in images that presented San Francisco rising from the ashes. Many of the unidentified images in the show seem to have been made by amateurs, who by then had ready access to cameras and roll film. Kodak introduced the first home camera in 1888, and its fabled point-and-shoot box version, the Brownie, in 1900. By 1906, it was marketing several new Brownie models a year, including one that could make miniature panoramas and another that produced postcard-sized negatives. In contrast to the more repetitive commercial images, the amateur snapshots vary strikingly. A group of bowler-hatted men stands transfixed as the fire roars up the street toward them. (One wonders if any were trapped unexpectedly, like some onlookers at the World Trade Center.) Other images focus on the everyday activities associated with rebuilding -- homes being dynamited, stores reopening in abandoned houses, families preparing meals on the street. Several record other amateur lensmen at work: one, a snapshot that was clearly made with a Brownie, depicts a man photographing a woman. Of course, he's using a Brownie, too. Perhaps what's most remarkable is that so many people, rather than helping with whatever heroic task was at hand, were out taking pictures. ''By 1906, people understood that an event like this needed to be photographed,'' Ms. Keller said. ''That this should be a primary impulse was quite a new thing.'' What wasn't new was the public's interest in catastrophic spectacle. As every disaster survivor knows, such events tend to transform one's most private emotions and belongings into public property -- fodder for infotainment -- and it seems to have been no different in 1906. One of the creepiest entries in the show is a photo album compiled by one of the many tourists who flocked to the city to witness the awesome destruction firsthand. Titled ''Visit to San Francisco a month after the earthquake and fire of April 18, 1906,'' it combines amateur photographs with newspaper clippings and professionally produced images and postcards. Many are accompanied, nightly news style, by disjunctively perky captions. A snapshot of a building festooned with handmade signs bears the inscription ''A splendid business location,'' while a photo of a makeshift cafe is labeled ''A rare treat at the Cafe Royale after a morning of sightseeing.'' Like all good historical artifacts, the album suggests that even the most dispiriting aspects of contemporary life aren't as newfangled as they seem. 1906 Earthquake: A Disaster in Pictures San Francisco Museum of Modern Art 151 Third Street, San Francisco Through May 30 ART"
"In this centennial year of the great 1906 earthquake, San Francisco has tectonic shifts on the brain. Among the planned commemorations of the event are ''Symphony No. 1: The Earthquake,'' to be played by the Contra Costa Wind Symphony, an ''Earthquake Walking Tour of San Francisco'' by the Northern California Geological Society and a tour of campus retrofit projects at the University of California, Berkeley. But the loopiest ode to the unpredictable layers beneath the city's surface may well be ''Earthquake'' -- a luminous, quivering rendering of the Twin Peaks neighborhood composed of nearly a thousand translucent Jell-O cubes. Inspired by liquefaction, which causes water-saturated soil to flow like water, the work, created by Liz Hickok, a 32-year-old artist, combines two Bay Area obsessions: food and earthquakes. Ms. Hickok's cityscape is the latest in her ''San Francisco in Jell-O'' series, which has also included likenesses of Telegraph Hill and City Hall. It was on display Friday evening on a ''shake table'' at the Exploratorium, a popular museum of art and science. Jiggling jewels of Jell-O substituted for the city's Victorian houses, while a Tupperware container filled with dry ice simulated fog. Jell-O, explained the artist -- who was raised in Wilmington, Del., on her grandmother's lime-green Jell-O mold with maraschino cherries and whipped cream -- is an apt metaphor for San Francisco. ''It makes us aware of the temporary nature of it all,'' Ms. Hickok said. ''We're sitting on fragile ground.'' Her one-night tableau was constructed by pouring Jell-O mix into molds and then carving the cubes to create roofs, doors and windows. The hilly topography, executed in gelatin, was adapted from a contour map procured from the city's public works department. The mini city spent the night in pieces in a refrigerator. Ms. Hickok will reconstruct it at the museum on April 1 to kick off the monthlong exhibit ''Magnitude X: Earthquake Science and Survival.'' Wobbling ominously and exuding a fruity bouquet, the Jell-O city offered food for thought, said Eric Muller, one of the museum's science educators. ''Jell-O is the ideal resonant medium,'' Mr. Muller said, referring to the ability of structures to respond to vibration. ''It's a cool way to bring up structural engineering issues and earthquake awareness.'' The museum, fittingly perhaps, is in the Marina District, which had heavy structural damage because of liquefying soil in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Nick Cain, a 33-year-old writer, said he found the display ''strangely compelling.'' ''Like San Francisco,'' Mr. Cain said, ''it's delicious but potentially unstable.'' The city's capacity for cultural shifts and physical dislocation arguably makes Jell-O an ideal artistic medium. ''I like making light of something scary,'' Ms. Hickok said. ''It makes it easier to handle our fear.''"
"A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9 shook Greece and rattled the eastern Mediterranean on Sunday, damaging scores of buildings and injuring two people. The authorities in Athens said the quake, felt as far away as Jordan, originated from seismic fault lines between the islands of Kithira and Crete, in southern Greece, and was under water, at a depth of 43.5 miles. ''We were extremely lucky that this was an underwater earthquake,'' said Giorgos Stavrakakis, director of the Athens Geodynamic Institute. ''Had it happened on land, it would have been a mess.'' No tsunami warnings were issued. Still, the authorities said Greece's civilian and military forces had been placed on ''red alert'' because of strong aftershocks recorded in the region throughout Sunday. At least two people were injured on Crete while trying to flee their homes. About 50 old, unoccupied buildings and a church collapsed on Kithira, said the regional governor, Yannis Mihas, but no casualties were reported."
"One hundred years ago next Tuesday, the San Andreas fault off San Francisco broke, setting off the earthquake that made clear the seismic perils facing West Coast cities. The scientific repercussions continue, as researchers still look to data from the 1906 earthquake -- which released 30 times as much energy as the 1989 Loma Prieta quake -- to prepare for the next great one. Last month, results of two years of computer simulations recreating the ground shaking experienced in 1906 were presented by scientists from the United States Geological Survey; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Stanford University; the University of California, Berkeley; and the URS Corporation, an engineering company. That could help indicate areas where the reinforcement of buildings should be a priority. Next week, at a scientific conference commemorating the anniversary, another study is to take the new shaking findings and estimate what the 1906 quake would wreak on the San Francisco Bay area in 2006. The toll, the researchers conclude, would include several thousand dead, several hundred thousand homeless and more than $100 billion in damage. The Great San Francisco Earthquake hit April 18, 1906, at 5:12 a.m., and it was over in a minute. Much of San Francisco was in rubble, and much of what was still standing burned in the firestorm that followed. ''I was within a stone's throw of that city hall when the hand of an avenging God fell upon San Francisco,'' Fred J. Hewitt, a reporter for The San Francisco Examiner, wrote a couple of days later. ''The ground rose and fell like an ocean at ebb tide. Then came the crash. Tons upon tons of that mighty pile slid away from the steel framework and destructiveness of that effort was terrific.'' The devastation spurred California to appoint a team of scientists and engineers, led by Andrew C. Lawson, chairman of the geology department at the University of California, to exhaustively study what happened when nearly 300 miles of the San Andreas jumped more than 20 feet in some places. ''We view the 1906 earthquake as the beginning of earthquake science,'' said Mary Lou Zoback of the United States Geological Survey. ''We are still reaping the rewards of the data that was collected and preserved.'' For decades, the quake was described as magnitude 8.3 on the Richter scale, but the Richter scale exaggerates the power of the largest earthquakes. On the modern earthquake scales, seismologists now put the 1906 quake at magnitude 7.8 or 7.9. The rupture started offshore, the epicenter two miles west of the San Francisco Zoo. Eyewitness accounts from 1906 describe a roar, like thunder, growing in loudness from the west. That was probably the initial earthquake waves radiating outward at 14,000 miles an hour. Then, seconds later, a wave of strong shaking arrived, traveling at a slower 8,000 m.p.h. The new simulations are based on a three-dimensional model of the area's rocks and soil, enabling better tracking of the bouncing of the seismic waves and explaining why some places were hit harder. ''We see a particularly isolated bright spot of shaking at Santa Rosa,'' 50 miles north of San Francisco, said Brad T. Aagaard, the Geological Survey geophysicist who led the effort. Santa Rosa is on a small basin of sediment that amplified the shaking, and the surrounding bowl of bedrock reflected the energy of the seismic waves back into the Santa Rosa basin, Dr. Aagaard said. In other places, man-made geology worsened the destruction. The heavily damaged southern part of the city had once been marsh, lakes and rivers. Then -- even moreso now -- large sections of San Francisco were built on filled-in ground that is susceptible to liquefaction -- loose soil that turns to almost a liquid when violently shaken. In the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, liquefaction amplified damage in the Marina district, another neighborhood of filled-in land. John Boatwright, another Geological Survey scientist, said the simulations fit reasonably well with the intensities he had deduced from damage and shaking reports originally gathered by Dr. Lawson's team after the 1906 earthquake. ''I think we're getting there on predicting the ground motion,'' Dr. Boatwright said. An eyewitness account by an engineer named Joseph H. Harper described how the initial shock waves did not cause much damage, while the later, stronger shaking was in a side-to-side direction, like shaking a taut rope left and right quickly. That matches the two types of earthquake waves that scientists now know about. The initial shaking came from what seismologists called primary waves or p-waves, that traveled 14,000 m.p.h. but inflicted little damage. The slower secondary waves, or s-waves, carried most of the energy and caused most of the damage. Mr. Harper's description is ''almost exactly what you would expect,'' Dr. Boatwright said. But the models do not yet capture some other aspects of the earthquake. The simulations assume that the fault broke to the northwest and to the southeast simultaneously, suggesting that strongest shaking should have swept through San Francisco in about 20 seconds. Instead, Mr. Harper and other eyewitnesses described two or three episodes of strong shaking that together lasted perhaps up to a minute. ''These heavier shocks were not of constant energy,'' Mr. Harper said, ''but seemed to progress in three distinct pulsations, each separated by an interval of comparative quiet.'' Mr. Hewitt, the San Francisco Examiner reporter, wrote that after the initial shaking there was a momentary lull before ''the street beds heaved in frightful fashion.'' ''The earth rocked and then came the blow that wrecked San Francisco from the bay shore to the Ocean Beach and from the Golden Gate to the end of the peninsula,'' he continued. Dr. Boatwright suggested that the fault first broke to the southeast and then the second segment broke toward the northwest. The second wave of shaking was stronger and knocked over the weakened buildings, he said. ''This was really the fatal blow to the city,'' he said. In some places, signs of the 1906 earthquake are still visible. Near a reservoir south of San Francisco, a fence and a row of trees put up before the earthquake still stand. Both the fence and trees form straight lines down a hill except a bend where they jog nine feet to the right. ''It wasn't built that way,'' said Carol S. Prentice of the Geological Survey. That is the boundary between the North American and Pacific plates. The signs of earthquakes can also be seen in the paths of streams that cross the fault. The sudden slip severs a stream channel until erosion along the fault reconnects it. A succession of stream channels show that earthquakes recur at the same location, and the dating of the earthquakes show that the fault ruptures every century or two. Elsewhere it is clear that the forces of the earth are still at play. From Twin Peaks, a pair of steep hills overlooking San Francisco, the Farallone Islands are visible on clear days. Measurements by a network of global positioning stations around the bay show that these rocky uninhabited islands are passing by San Francisco, moving north about one inch a year. The San Andreas fault, the division between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates, lies offshore along this stretch, between San Francisco and the Farallones, and it has been locked tight since 1906. As the rocks distant from the San Andreas continue their inexorable march, stress at the fault has been building for 100 years. A century ago, Henry Fielding Reid, a member of Dr. Lawson's team, also noticed, from surveying records, that points far from the fault were moving before the earthquake. ''He was actually able to surmise that there had to be some loading at a great distance,'' said Dr. Zoback of the Geological Survey. That led Dr. Reid, a professor of applied mechanics at Johns Hopkins, to propose that earthquakes were caused by the ''elastic rebound'' release of stress, like the breaking of a rubber band pulled too far. ''He had it all right,'' Dr. Zoback said. ''In the instant of the earthquake, the fault then moves to catch up with the distant points that have been moving. And immediately after an earthquake, this cycle begins again.'' That means earthquakes along the San Andreas are destined to repeat. Elastic rebound fits well with present-day knowledge of how the Earth's crust moves and reshapes, but at the time no one thought continents moved. ''It was a fairly bold hypothesis to put forward,'' Dr. Zoback said, ''because he had absolutely no idea why there would be this distant loading.'' Alfred Wegener would not propose the idea of continental drift until 1915 and that theory, now called plate tectonics, did not gain wide acceptance until the 1960's. The Geological Survey estimated in 2002 a 62 percent chance of a magnitude 6.7 earthquake or larger hitting the bay area before 2032 along one of the bramble of seven major earthquake faults. The highest probability -- 27 percent -- is the Hayward fault, which runs along the east side of San Francisco Bay through Oakland and Berkeley, and its extension to the north, the Rodgers Creek fault. The last earthquake there occurred in 1868, estimated at magnitude 7.0, and the time between the last few has been about 135 years. ''We just passed the average of 135 years,'' said David P. Schwartz, a Geological Survey scientist who helped calculate the probabilities. Along the San Andreas, large earthquakes occur once every 220 years on average, and giant earthquakes only once every four centuries, so a repeat of 1906 is probably not imminent. Correction: April 17, 2006, Monday A picture caption in Science Times on Tuesday with an article about lessons of the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 misspelled the name of a downtown street. It was Grant Avenue, not Grand."
"WHEN a magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck San Francisco 100 years ago Tuesday and the city -- like New Orleans last year -- lay in ruins, Theodore Roosevelt was president and cars were just a plaything of the rich. By the time San Francisco regained its past glory, at least according to some historians here, the automobile had started to reshape America's cities, Roosevelt was dead and, four presidents later, the country was on the precipice of the Great Depression. ''It took San Francisco something like 20 years to fully recover'' from the 1906 earthquake, said Mary C. Comerio, a professor of architecture at the University of California, Berkeley. ''That might seem a really long time,'' said Ms. Comerio, author of ''Disaster Hits Home,'' a book examining the post-disaster recovery of cities around the globe, ''but social scientists who follow this kind of thing find that's pretty much the norm, whatever era we're talking about.'' And then there are those who believe San Francisco, which, like New Orleans, had lost more than half its housing stock, never fully recovered. ''The city never really recaptured that same dominance over the West that it had before the earthquake,'' said Philip L. Fradkin, author of ''The Great Earthquake and Firestorms of 1906.'' The earthquake lasted 40 seconds; the firestorms fueled by cracked gas mains blazed for three days. Together they killed at least 3,000 people and left 225,000 homeless in what was long regarded as the worst natural disaster to befall an American city -- that is, until Hurricane Katrina. Though the two disasters occurred 99 years apart, academics and writers who have studied the great quake of 1906 see parallels between these bejeweled European-style cities and the events that crippled them. And they see a prime opportunity to peer into the future to understand better the fate that most likely awaits New Orleans, a city still reeling nearly eight months after it was struck. New Orleans can be the most parochial of cities, an inward looking burg whose residents take a kind of perverse pride in their benighted view of happenings outside its borders. That might be just as well right now given the prognosis offered by those like Ms. Comerio who have viewed New Orleans through the prism of San Francisco and other large-scale disasters. They have little in the way of heartening news. ''Maybe New Orleans will astound everyone, but I wouldn't be honest if I said the prospects were overwhelmingly good for New Orleans coming back anything like its old self,'' said Joel Kotkin, a scholar with the New America Foundation who studied the 1906 quake when writing ''The City: A Global History.'' Both San Francisco and New Orleans were swashbuckling cities with 400,000 to 500,000 people when disaster struck, and both had reputations for permissiveness and bawdy fun. Just as New Orleans has the French Quarter, San Francisco at the start of the 20th century had the rough-and-tumble, anything-goes Barbary Coast. One was built atop what Simon Winchester, author of ''A Crack in the Edge of the World,'' described as ''undeniably the most dangerous plate boundary in the Pacific region''; the other might be even more precariously situated: much of New Orleans lies below sea level in a region known for flooding and hurricanes. ''The queen city of the far West'' was the way the historian Kevin Starr, who has written half a dozen books about California, characterized San Francisco circa 1906 -- a pretty good descriptor if looking for a phrase to capture New Orleans's place in the Deep South. Even the shorthand used to refer to each disaster is, if not wrong, not quite right, either. The great quake was as much the great fire that followed; the great hurricane, a great flood. One major difference between the cities -- a difference that may well hurt New Orleans in its recovery -- boils down to the ambition and dreams of each when disaster struck. San Francisco was a relatively new metropolis, one crackling with energy and optimism. Then the most populous city west of the Mississippi (today its 777,000 residents rank it fourth among California cities), San Francisco harbored dreams of growing into a metropolis of two million that would reign as the undisputed financial and cultural capital of the West. New Orleans, by contrast, was approaching 300 years old when Katrina struck; it was a city that might be compared to a once glorious mansion occupied by a few generations of descendants who could not quite handle the cost of upkeep. ''New Orleans was a city that was in its dotage when disaster struck,'' Mr. Kotkin said. ''It was a city that had been in decline for decades.'' What Mr. Kotkin described as an ''absence of upward energy'' could prove critical as New Orleans slogs through a recovery that promises to take years. ''I'm not sure we'll see the same level of investment in New Orleans,'' he said. Such is the nature of disasters that they bring existing problems into sharper relief. ''What we've learned studying San Francisco and other disasters is that a city responds to a catastrophe with the same level of functionalism and dysfunctionalism that it had before the catastrophe,'' Mr. Starr said. ''And as we all found out in New Orleans, a catastrophe brings to the surface those dysfunctions.'' Catastrophe brings some dangerous impulses to the fore as well. In 1906, the city fathers did not tighten the municipal safety codes so as to prevent future catastrophes but instead used their collective power to play down the earthquake's destructiveness. ''The business community and politicians decided an earthquake would be bad news for the city and its future,'' said Peter J. Flagg, director of the Society of California Pioneers, based in San Francisco, which recently unveiled an exhibit called ''Shake, Bake and Spin.'' ''So after the first few days you see in newspaper accounts references to the fire or conflagration, and a downplaying of the earthquake as minor, when it wasn't minor at all.'' Yet there was no countering the lingering effects of the earthquake and the images carried in newspapers around the country. Almost instantly the '06 quake transformed Oakland, which sits directly across the bay (a city that, it turns out, sits atop an even more volatile fault line), ''from a kind of pastoral suburb into a city,'' according to Mr. Starr, the former state librarian and now a professor of history at the University of Southern California. And in short order, he said, Los Angeles, and to a lesser extent Seattle and Portland, began to encroach on San Francisco's primacy. New Orleans long ago ceded its primacy to Houston and Atlanta. It was confronting any number of challenges before it became a prime subject of study for those who might best be described as sociologists of disaster. And now, just as 1906 forever changed perceptions of San Francisco, so, too, will the indelible images of a city sitting under water play a factor as the city seeks new investments to make up for all those businesses that fled the city or simply shuttered their doors for good -- and all those residents who are too old or too poor to return or simply see better opportunities elsewhere. ''I think this all adds up to terribly bad news for New Orleans,'' Ms. Comerio of Berkeley said. ''I look into the future and see a city half its size.'' The Nation"
"The death toll in the strong earthquake that hit Iran's western province of Lorestan on Friday morning was at 70, and more than 300 villages had been hit, state television reported later in the day. Television stations showed brick houses that had been reduced to piles of rubble, with bent steel girders on the ground. Residents were shown gathered in clusters outside what used to be their homes. The TV reports said the number of deaths might not go much higher because most residents in the province had been alarmed by a weaker earthquake a few hours earlier and were spending the night outdoors. One official told the television stations that the governor's office dispatched messengers to villages to warn residents on loudspeakers not to spend the night inside their homes. The stronger earthquake hit at 4:47 a.m., and had a magnitude of 6.0, the ISNA state news agency reported. It was followed by two smaller quakes and nearly 40 aftershocks, the news agency said. The United States Geological Survey reported that the magnitude of the earthquake was 5.7, and its epicenter was 210 miles southwest of Tehran, the capital. The reports said that more than 300 villages were at least 30 percent destroyed and that some villages had been totally flattened. More than 1,200 people were injured. The epicenter was in the mountains south of the city of Borujerd and north of Doroud, and most of those who died were in that area. The tremor was felt in two neighboring provinces, Arak and Hamedan. The lesson about the value of early warnings was learned from the devastating earthquake in the southeastern city of Bam in 2003, which killed 31,000 people. Many of those who survived spent the night outdoors. Rescue teams along with helicopters, ambulances and sniffer dogs were sent to the region immediately on Friday. Heavy machinery was used to move the rubble in search of survivors. State television said most of the rescue operation would be finished by Saturday morning. ''The biggest problem is providing shelter for people because of the region's cold weather,'' said Moyed Alavian, a deputy health minister who visited the region, ISNA reported. ''We do not need medicine or aid workers at this stage any more.'' The television reports said that 11,000 tents and 10,000 blankets had been distributed in the chilly mountainous region but that at least another 10,000 tents were required. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Friday during a visit to England that the United States was prepared to offer aid. Iran is situated on seismic fault lines. Another strong earthquake of magnitude 6 struck a sparsely populated region in southern Iran this week. One person died in a landslide set off by the quake."
"Some historic events remain sealed in the past. Napoleon is not likely to invade Russia again. But historic events caused by natural phenomena have a way of escaping from the past. A good example is the great San Francisco earthquake, which occurred at 5:12 a.m. 100 years ago today. That quake, approximately 7.8 on modern earthquake scales, abruptly relieved the tension along the San Andreas fault, where two tectonic plates -- the North American and the Pacific -- were sliding past each other. At the epicenter, two miles west of the city, the earth jumped sideways nearly a dozen feet in a few seconds, part of a 300 mile rupture along the fault. Suddenly, roughly half of San Francisco's residents were homeless, and most of the city was burning. Those two plates are still trying to slip past each other. The tension relieved by the 1906 earthquake began to build again the instant the earth stopped shaking, and it is building at this moment. The photographs of San Francisco after the earthquake are sobering -- a city of rubble engulfed in smoke and flame -- but in fact they hide the actual force of the quake. To a modern eye, that old San Francisco looks familiarly antique, a relic of an earlier time. The towers that fell in the financial district were barely towers by our standards, and there were no bridges or freeways to collapse. To imagine the force of that quake we need to think of the city as we know it today and remember that the 1906 earthquake released 30 times more energy than the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989. San Francisco is wholly new since 1906, and it has been rebuilt to increasingly refined standards of seismic preparedness, which were toughened further after 1989. Seismology has progressed to a point where earthquake prediction is a feasible, if still imperfect, science. But what has changed more than anything in the past century is the urbanization of the region, which is part of a series of seismically active zones that reach as far north as Vancouver along the edges of the Pacific and Juan de Fuca plates. We think of the 1906 earthquake as the big one, vastly bigger than the Loma Prieta quake. But in the backdrop -- just beyond the timeline of American settlement on the West Coast -- there is the memory of the Cascadia earthquake, estimated at magnitude 9, which hit the north coast on Jan. 26, 1700. These earthquakes all belong to the past, but they are almost certain to belong to the future, too. Editorial"
"When she was 14 months old, Della Vattuone-Bacchini survived the Great Quake of 1906, which ruptured the San Andreas fault, twisted rail lines into pretzels and sparked a three-day inferno that burned much of this city to the ground. But whether she makes it through this year's centennial, she said, is an entirely different question. ''It's been a mad rush,'' said Ms. Vattuone-Bacchini, 101, of the anniversary celebrations. ''They come up every year and you get caught up with them whether you like it or not. I like it, but it's a pain, both.'' Sure enough, over the last two weeks, about a dozen survivors of the quake -- a magnitude 7.8 or 7.9 on the modern earthquake scales that struck at 5:12 a.m. on April 18, 1906 -- have been made into centennial celebrities, shuttled from opening day celebrations at the ballpark, media-frenzy lunches downtown and Tuesday morning's painfully early breakfast with Mayor Gavin Newsom. All of which is fun, most survivors say, but also taxing for a group of people whose claim to fame is somewhat dampened by the fact that they do not really remember the event in question. ''Everybody asks the same questions, and to tell the truth, nobody remembers,'' said Norma Norwood, a 99-year-old who lives on her own. ''We were kids. People ask how have things changed, and I say, 'I don't know.' I wasn't paying any attention to that. I was paying attention to minding my father.'' Ms. Norwood, as her age suggests, is a special case. She counts herself as a survivor even though she had not been conceived at the time of the earthquake; that blessed event happened days after, when her parents were huddled in a refugee camp in Golden Gate Park. ''My father said it was cold that night,'' Ms. Norwood said. Such details, of course, are middling considering the scope of this year's commemoration, which has included package deals at hotels and spas, earthquake cocktails at bars, and exhaustive coverage by the city's news media. All of it has tried to strike a balance between a celebration and a sobering realization that, given the geology of San Francisco, a similar disaster could happen at any time. Indeed, even as civic leaders gathered Monday night for a lavish ball at the Palace Hotel (complete with period costumes and Enrico Caruso look-alikes), geophysicists were meeting here to begin what was being billed as the biggest earthquake conference ever, concerned with the probability of -- and preparation for -- another Big One. A study commissioned by the conference organizers and released Monday suggested that a similar quake to 1906 could prove as terrible, if not worse. According to the study, prepared by Charles Kircher and Associates, a structural engineering firm, a 7.9 temblor today could kill 3,400 people, displace a quarter of a million and cause $150 billion in damage. The 1906 quake, which tore a 300-mile-long fissure in the San Andreas fault, and its subsequent fires killed some 3,000 people, destroyed more than 50,000 buildings and left more than 200,000 homeless. Finding the right tone for the anniversary has largely fallen to Charlotte Mailliard Shultz, the chief of protocol for the City of San Francisco and the State of California, who also is chairwoman of San Francisco Rising, the official centennial organizer. Ms. Shultz said the anniversary offered an unusual opportunity both to commemorate the past and educate the current generation. As such, San Francisco Rising has distributed tens of thousands of pamphlets on earthquake safety and emergency response strategies, and has set up a preparedness Web site, www.72hours.org, which refers to how long a person might have to survive without help in a major quake. But Ms. Shultz also agreed that the centennial had offered San Franciscans, who had largely rebuilt their city by 1909, a chance to party. ''It's a very solemn affair, but we're also proud of what we did, getting ourselves out of the ashes -- that's something to celebrate,'' Ms. Shultz said. ''And the survivors are the people who helped set the stage for that and they should be celebrated as well. They epitomize what San Francisco is.'' And sure enough, serving as the human face of a natural disaster can have its perks. Herbert Hamrol, 103, says all he remembers of the 1906 quake is ''my mother carrying me down the stairs'' from his family's downtown apartment. Nonetheless, Mr. Hamrol has been soaking up a dose of celebrity since he attended his first quake anniversary three years ago. This year, he, along with seven other survivors, threw out the first pitches at the San Francisco Giants' home opener -- ''It was low,'' he said of his throw -- and on Tuesday, he will awake in a free room at the Westin St. Francis before heading out, just ahead of dawn, to attend an annual commemoration ceremony. But Mr. Hamrol, who still works two days a week at Andronico's grocery store (he tends to damaged goods, appropriately enough), said that what he most appreciated was the personal attention that came from being one of the few men to have survived the quake and the century that followed it. ''A lot of little old ladies look for me at the store on Mondays and Thursdays,'' said Mr. Hamrol, who has been a widower since 1969. ''And they're happy and smiling when they leave.'' Ms. Norwood, the 99-year-old, has become friendly with Mr. Hamrol, and both were on hand Monday afternoon at John's Grill, which dates to 1908 and has been playing host to an anniversary lunch for survivors for 15 years. They and a dozen others took questions, including the predictable queries about their longevity. ''I just tell them sex, and that usually ends the questions,'' Ms. Norwood said."
"ONE hundred years ago to-day, at 5:12 A.M., the quaking earth jolted Wong Bok Yue out of hisbed in San Francisco's Chinese quarter. As thewalls shook, Wong and his family fled their one-room apartment on ClayStreet with nothing butthe clothes on theirbacks. A neighbor car-ried Wong's two-year-old daughter, Bessie,while he carried his wife, who had boundfeet. They hurried to Van Ness Avenue, where they huddled as buildings col-lapsed and fires spread. By nightfall flames had con-sumed Chinatown, home to the city's 25,000 Chinese. The Chinese were just one group among the 200,000 San Franciscans left home-less by the great earthquake and fire of 1906. But their experience was sin-gular, for only they faced the threat of permanent displacement -- a threat, fueled by racism, they some-how managed to defeat. Anti-Chinese prejudice, a staple of California politics since the 1870's, was still in full force at the time of the earthquake. In the days after the dis-aster both San Francisco and Oak-land (where thousands of people sought refuge) barred Chinese fromwhite relief camps. San Francisco of-ficials put Chinese in tents at the foot of Van Ness, but worries that they might stay in the neighborhood led totheir relocation to the golf links onthe Presidio. After white neighbors protested that ''the summer zephyrswill blow the odors of Chinatown into their front doors,'' the city moved there fugees again, to a more remote location on the Presidio near Fort Point. Meanwhile, looters (mostly members of the National Guard) ran-sacked Chinatown. A crowd stoned to death a young Chinese man who tried to retrieve items from his home. Taking advantage of the situationto promote their anti-Chinese agenda, nativists mobilized to drive the Chinese out of the city for good. The Overland Monthly proclaimed: ''Fire has reclaimed to civilization and cleanliness the Chinese ghetto, and no Chinatown will be permitted in the borders of the city. It seems as though a divine wisdom directed therange of the seismic horror and the range of the fire god. Wisely, the worst was cleared away with the best. ''Mayor Eugene Schmitz formed acommittee to oversee the permanent relocation of the Chinese quarter. The goal was to move it from valuable land next to the central business district to Hunters Point, just over the city's southern border. As the city began to rebuild, organized labor forbade union members from working on buildings at sites that had been cleared by Chinese labor. The Asiatic Exclusion League kept up the pressure: ''We can withstand the earthquake. We can survive the fire. But the moment the Golden State is subjected to an unlimited Asiatic coolie invasion there will be no more California.'' In the face of this opposition, the Chinese Six Companies, the community's merchant leadership group, and the Chinese consulate fought back. As property owners, they made it clear they would rebuild on their land. An official of the Chinese Legation told city officials, ''America is a free country, and every man has a right to occupy land which he owns provided he makes no nuisance.'' But it was economic interest rather than patriotic appeal -- that checked the momentum for removal. City officials realized that they stood to miss out on revenue from taxes paid by Chinese. Perhaps more important, San Francisco risked losing the China trade, as Oakland, Los Angeles and Seattle quickly offered their ports. Moving Chinatown to another area in San Francisco proved impossible because no other neighborhood would stand for it. Keenly aware of racist sentiment, Chinese leaders sought to rebuild in a way that would let Chinatown overcome its reputation as an overcrowded, diseased bachelor's slum full of gambling and opium halls. Promoting wholesome tourism was part of the plan. Look Tin Eli, a wealthy merchant and founder of the Bank of Can-ton, wanted to create a city of ''veritable fairy palaces. ''Toward that end the merchants hired American architects, who stuck pagoda-in-spired rooflines and other Asian motifs on the facades of standard Western buildings to create an ''Oriental'' streetscape. The style,which had been used to great effect in the Chinese Village at the 1893 Chicago world's fair, gave the new Chinatown the air of a theme park. Look Tin Eli's building at Grant and California, one of the first to feature the faux-Chinese style, housed a restaurant and an Oriental bazaar that sold ivory, porcelain, silks and other exotic items. The design strategy would soon be replicated in Chinatowns across the country. In addition to promoting tourism,community leaders sought to bring about social change. Inspired by American reform movements at Hull House, Tuskegee and elsewhere, they promoted public hygiene, nuclear families and middle-class respectability. They also emphasized Americanization, building a Chinese hospital with Western medicine, a Y.M.C.A.and Y.W.C.A., a Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese-American Citizens Alliance. Other projects simultaneously strengthened the community's ties to Chinese culture and China: Chinese language schools were built, Chinatown residents worked to topple the Manchu dynasty back home. For decades after the earthquake, San Francisco's Chinatown would remain a poor and marginalized community. Still, it was a community that never left town -- despite the pressure to do so. What's more, out of the mix of rebuilding and reform a new Chinatown emerged, one that helped Chinese-Americans claim a place not just in San Francisco, but in cities across the United States.

"Like the tender green shoots emerging with spring's warmth, signs of life are emerging here from the rubble of last October's devastating earthquake. Produce markets are busy, and the sounds of construction reverberate through the neighborhoods, but the mood here is anything but celebratory. That is because the government has decided that Balakot, a town of about 30,000 that was closest to the epicenter of the 7.8 magnitude earthquake and by far the most damaged, will have to be relocated. Balakot, it turns out, sits on top of two major fault lines. ''And these two are extremely active fault lines,'' Lt. Gen. Nadeem Ahmed, the deputy chairman of the country's Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority, said in an interview at his office in Islamabad, the capital. ''If, God forbid, they get activated, this town is just going to blow up.'' The townspeople, not surprisingly, see it differently. ''We don't agree,'' said Husnain Hazrat, 23, who lost his store in the quake but has already rebuilt a small shop in the main market of the town. ''We will not move an inch.'' The market was also destroyed by the quake, but makeshift shops and tea stalls there are now bustling with activity. More than 75,000 people were killed in the earthquake, which struck northern Pakistan and the part of the disputed Kashmir region that it administers, and an estimated 3.5 million people were left homeless. Balakot, a picturesque, hilly town in North-West Frontier Province, was almost totally destroyed. More than 80 percent of the houses and government buildings here were razed, and many that were left standing developed dangerous cracks, making them unsafe to be occupied. Shops and buildings built on the terraced hills fell into the Kunhar River, which meanders through the town. After the quake, Turkish geologists in consultation with the Pakistanis did a seismic study of the affected areas. ''To our horror, we found out that two major fault lines pass directly under the city,'' General Ahmed said. ''We are ethically and morally bound to tell the people that this place is unsafe for living.'' In early April the Pakistani cabinet approved Balakot's relocation, and people have been advised not to undertake any extensive reconstruction, though many are doing exactly that. Government officials have identified Bakarial, about 15 miles from Balakot, as the site for the new city. General Ahmed said land acquisition would not be a problem, as most of the land there was already owned by the government. He said a government planning team had estimated that it would take two to three years and $100 million to build the new city. But in Balakot, despite the potential dangers of its location, residents are vigorously protesting. Many said they had survived one quake and would take their chances on another, while others vowed to hang on to the land of their forefathers, which remains precious to them even in its current degraded condition. Many simply doubted that the government would fulfill its grand promises. Before the earthquake the city was the center of the Balakot district, which has a population of 300,000. As the gateway to the picturesque valleys of northern Pakistan, it was a popular tourist destination, Junaid Qasim, the town's mayor, said in an interview. In the summer, officials said, the population would swell to 45,000 to 50,000. The town is also known for the burial site of Syed Ahmed Shaheed, a Muslim warrior who died in an epic battle in 1831 while fighting the Sikhs, and the shrine of another saint, Shah Ismail Shaheed, who fell in the same battle. ''Because of the historical, commercial and cultural value, the stakes for the people are high,'' Mr. Qasim said. ''And therefore the resistance.'' He added that there was uncertainty regarding the government's announcement. No date for the relocation has been given, he said, and details are still being worked out. Mr. Hazrat, the shop owner, was busy handing out cigarettes, cold drinks and soap to customers on a recent afternoon. Snow covered the distant mountains, and rubble from the destroyed shops was scattered across the road. Mr. Hazrat's father died in the earthquake, and his family's house was destroyed. He cannot shake the terrible memories of the devastation, but he said his life was settling down and his shop doing a good business. His family has been in Balakot for 150 years, he said, so the idea of moving is unimaginable. ''It is the land of our ancestors,'' he said as a few customers gathered at the shop nodded in approval. ''Ninety percent of the people do not want to go.'' In an adjoining neighborhood, Abdul Shakoor, 28, said his family had been living in Balakot for three generations. The earthquake destroyed their house, and he is now living in a tent with his father and sister. These days he is busy trying to build some sort of more permanent shelter. ''You can find gold,'' he said, ''but you can't find timber.'' Mr. Shakoor said that he was ready to face the hardships and that his family was dead set against leaving. ''How can we?'' he said. ''Our forefathers are buried here.'' Abdul Maalik, 25, a teacher at a religious school in the neighboring town of Garhi Habibullah, which was also severely damaged, was in Balakot to offer prayers at the shrine of Syed Ahmed Shaheed. A bearded man with a medium build, Mr. Maalik took exception with the experts who had conducted the seismological survey. ''If there was any danger from a fault line they should have told us earlier, before the earthquake,'' he said. ''What's the use now, when so many have died?'' Balakot Journal"
"With so many print and broadcast outlets poking around in the dustbin of history these days, the great American disasters are starting to feel a bit overexposed. Certainly everyone will be sick of the San Francisco earthquake and fire by the time of its 100th anniversary next week. ''The Great Quake,'' the National Geographic Channel's contribution, to be broadcast tomorrow, feels like the same-old same-old, in terms of style: talking heads talk, actors re-enact. But in its most interesting moments it calls to mind another city, about 2005: New Orleans. As is fashionable in this genre, the documentary tries to humanize the catastrophe by following a few ordinary individuals in the hours leading up to the earthquake, which struck at dawn on April 18, and in the days afterward, as fire destroyed much of the city. One is Arnold Genthe, a portrait photographer who grabbed his camera and found lasting fame; the earthquake, the program points out, was one of the first major disasters in the age of mass photography. The program also tries to build some drama around the city's mayor, Eugene Schmitz: would he rise to the challenge and thus make people forget how corrupt he was? The mayor's storyline isn't all that enthralling, but the echo of New Orleans -- of leaders struggling to grasp the scope of the disaster, then either acting decisively or not -- certainly is. New Orleans comes to mind in other segments, particularly when the program talks about the area of San Francisco known as South of Market. It was a neighborhood built in defiance of nature -- reclaimed from the bay -- and was home to many poor people. When the quake hits this manmade ground, the soft soil sinks like water, the narration says. The seismic waves turn the ground to quicksand, sucking whole streets into the earth. Nature, it seems, didn't care for temerity from humans then any more than it does now.

"WHEN Dean Reese, a founder of a company that safeguards houses against earthquakes, arrived at my house here in Marin County one day in late March, he took one look at the ceramic planters in the tiled foyer and said, ''Those'll be the first to go.'' He also said that because my husband and I live on a narrow road on a steep hill, we could be on our own without services, or even a road, for days following a big quake. We had already begun assembling canned foods, water and medical supplies with just that worry in mind, I told Mr. Reese -- but what if those, too, were destroyed? ''It's just a matter of luck,'' he said lightly. When it comes to seismic consciousness, Californians tend to fall into two camps: the scoffers, many native to the state, who pay little attention to the constant barrage of official warnings, and those like this reporter (born in New York but raised in California) who know that the warnings should not be ignored. When the topic of earthquakes comes up at dinner parties, the worriers feel their palms grow clammy and think vaguely about the places they do not want to be when the next big one hits: above the water on the eastern span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, for instance, or 135 feet under water on a Bay Area Rapid Transit train. Scoffers like my native-born husband, on the other hand, take pleasure in telling stories like the one about the 6.9-magnitude Loma Prieta quake in 1989, when he steadied a sloshing fish tank with one arm while holding a confused toddler in the other. In 2005, when we sold our house on one major earthquake fault and bought one on another, I was so transfixed by the beauty of the new place that I briefly joined the ranks of those who prefer to live in a fog of denial. I put china on high shelves and pooh-poohed the notion of earthquake insurance. Then came the drumroll leading up to the centennial of the San Francisco earthquake of April 18, 1906, which, with a magnitude of 7.9, unleashed firestorms and killed 3,000 people along a 290-mile fissure. The relentless parade of anniversary events, exhibitions and articles -- at once commemorative and anticipatory -- succeeded in making me anxious again. Very anxious. So when I got a call from Mr. Reese's company, Trevco -- which sells a variety of adhesive putties and gels, Velcro straps, gas-valve shutoff wrenches and disaster preparedness kits, all under the reassuring name QuakeHold -- I was eager to hear what he had to say. According to Mr. Reese, his company, in Escondido, Calif., is something of a pioneer in the earthquake-protection industry, having patented an adhesive putty in 1990 and developed the straps in 1994; the products are now widely available through national home improvement stores like Home Depot and Lowe's. (He has plenty of competitors who offer similar products and services to earthquake-sensitive Californians, including Secure-It Consultants in Sherman Oaks, Fastening Solutions in Tarzana and Quake Kare in Moorpark.) Mr. Reese, who credited the 1906 anniversary with a recent increase in business, was in Northern California for a few centennial-related events and stopped by my house to demonstrate his products. I showed him our two fish tanks, and one of them -- an unusual cylinder resembling a drinking glass in my stepdaughter's room -- immediately got his attention. Filled with 15 gallons of water, it sits atop a small bedside table. Its abundant aquatic life brings us great pleasure, but whenever I think about it, all I can envision is post-temblor chaos -- broken glass, water everywhere and dozens of guppies in death throes on the floor. My brief exchanges with my husband about the tank reflect the chasm that separates us. Should the tank topple, he once said, ''it will be the least of your problems.'' I know this, I think to myself, but at least it represents something I can control. Staring at the tank, Mr. Reese shook his head with disapproval. I felt vindicated. I confessed, rather meekly, that I do not always keep a pair of sturdy shoes next to the bed to avoid treading on broken glass in the dark. I'm not sure where the nearest flashlight is, and although I did once buy a transistor radio against the protracted power outage that would probably accompany a bad earthquake, the batteries have long since died. Mr. Reese was understanding. He pulled out sample packets of putty, a small plastic jar of gel and several packages of reinforcement straps, and got to work. The QuakeHold putty is a proprietary synthetic compound, and the gel is a viscous silicon-based substance. Both can be used to secure large, heavy objects, but the gel is less conspicuous. First we anchored bowls, planters and vases that are seldom moved, along with a few that are shifted from time to time. Better to pry a beloved ceramic bowl off its adhesive mooring once in a while, I thought, than see it in a thousand shards on the tile floor. While I puttied and gelled my way through my more prized pieces of china, Mr. Reese and a colleague drilled holes in our walls and attached woven nylon straps to free-standing furniture. One end of each strap was attached with a screw to a stud in the wall, and the other end, which was finished with heavy-duty Velcro, was attached to a corresponding piece of Velcro stuck to a cupboard, armoire or bookcase (using an adhesive that Mr. Reese assured me could be peeled off without too much damage). Usually, two straps are used for each piece of furniture. The straps, designed to hold up to 400 pounds, come in a variety of colors to blend in with different finishes. One set was enough to secure the conventional rectangular fish tank, and for the precarious cylinder, Mr. Reese devised a sort of belt formed by two straps going around it. (I suspected, however, that in any serious earthquake the tank's high center of gravity would still doom it.) Later that day, still in the grip of seismic fear, I called my insurance company and sent off a large check for earthquake insurance, for the first time since we had moved. With a 15 percent deductible and a certain ambiguity about what exactly would be covered, it was hardly a perfect safeguard. And there I sat, knowing only this: If we are hit with a small or even moderate earthquake, my $102 investment in putty, gel, straps and labor means that our china is probably safe and our furniture will stay in place. Yet whatever waits in the recesses of the San Andreas fault, and how exactly the earth will shift and undulate under our property, are anybody's guess. Still, a wise friend reassured me during a recent phone conversation that not unlike the fault itself, I am relieving a little of my own built-up internal pressure by doing what I can. She offered her solace from her apartment in the Marina, a San Francisco neighborhood considered a liquefaction zone. ''I've got to move,'' she said."
"A strong earthquake struck the Hawaiian Islands early Sunday, shaking residents and tourists from their sleep, knocking out electrical power to several areas and setting off a landslide that rained boulders and other debris on the major highway of the largest island. The United States Geological Survey said that the main quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.6 and that there had been at least a dozen aftershocks, including one that measured 5.8. Officials said the quake was the largest to hit Hawaii since one of magnitude 6.7 in 1983. Gov. Linda Lingle issued a disaster declaration Sunday afternoon and activated the National Guard, which happened to be conducting a statewide drill this weekend. The governor ordered her cabinet to convene at the headquarters of the Hawaii State Department of Civil Defense, which is in Diamond Head crater in Honolulu, the state capital, on the island of Oahu. There were no reports of deaths, but there were scores of unconfirmed reports of injuries. Kona Community Hospital had significant damage, and patients were moved to a hotel, officials said. The lack of electricity hampered communications, and officials could not say exactly how severe the damage was or what the extent of injuries was. The governor urged people to go to work on Monday as usual. The quake, centered just off the northwest shore of the Island of Hawaii, occurred at 7:07 a.m. local time, officials said. That side of the island contains Kohala, a popular resort area. The quake and its aftershocks set off fears of a tsunami. But the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a report saying that ''no tsunami is expected'' because the quake was too deep and that its magnitude was below the tsunami trigger point of 6.9. Kawaihae Harbor, near the epicenter, was closed because of damage to buildings and a fuel line. Power was knocked out for hours in many areas, but by midafternoon, it had been restored to Hilo on the Island of Hawaii and to parts of Maui. Leonid Citer, 50, a photographer from Wayne, N.J., said in a telephone interview that he was on his way to photograph a wedding in Kona when the quake hit. Mr. Citer said he pulled to the side of the road when he felt the shock and debris began to rain down. ''There are rocks and fruit all over the road,'' he said. ''There are police and firemen at all the major intersections, and they were instructing people to go up as high as they can, elevation-wise, and they are advising them to stay away from the shore.'' Emergency management officials also urged residents and others to stay put if they could, to keep roadways open for emergency vehicles. Beth Chapman, who co-stars with her husband, Duane Chapman, on the A&E cable reality series ''Dog the Bounty Hunter,'' said she was at their home in the Portlock section of Oahu when the quakes hit. ''There were two quakes, one at 7:08 this morning and the second one at 7:12,'' she said in a telephone interview. ''I know because the clock stopped when the second one came. ''I was outside for the second one, and you could hear this strange noise coming from the ocean,'' Ms. Chapman said. ''Then the ground shook, and there was a huge wave in our swimming pool.'' Airports across the islands switched to emergency backup systems, which allowed inbound flights to land and a few outbound planes to depart. By midday, all flights out of the airports on Honolulu and Maui were canceled, as were flights to Hawaii from the United States mainland. At the airports still in operation, security officials checked luggage manually and agriculture agents used dogs to sniff packages and luggage because X-ray machines were without power. Officials asked cruise ships to keep guests on board, and ships scheduled to make landfall in Hawaii were asked to head to their next location. ''We're are dealing with a lot of scared people,'' Harry Kim, mayor of Hawaii County, said in a televised interview on KITV. Governor Lingle was on the Big Island, staying at the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel, when the building rattled. ''It shook very strongly and knocked the televisions off the bureaus in the hotel,'' she said in an interview on KSSK Radio, one of the few broadcast outlets that was not knocked off the air. ''TV's fell, books fell, mirrors fell off the wall.'' Insurance experts said that early reports suggested relatively light damage to homes and businesses and that perhaps the heaviest costs could result from electric power failures in Honolulu and on other islands. The insurers offered no immediate estimates on overall economic damage, but Robert P. Hartwig, chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute, said payouts for damage from insurance companies for the earthquake probably would be ''very modest,'' perhaps under $25 million compared with $1.1 billion for one of the least costly hurricanes last year, Hurricane Dennis, which hit Florida in June 2005. The most costly earthquake in the United States, the Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles in 1994, cost insurers up to $26 billion in today's dollars. It measured 6.7. By comparison, the insurers paid out $41 billion for damage from Hurricane Katrina. Mr. Hartwig said that probably no more than 25 percent of homeowners in Hawaii and fewer than 50 percent of businesses had special policies that pay for earthquake damage. ''Right now, it does not look like there is substantial structural damage or major fires,'' he said. ''And it looks like very modest costs to insurers. It could turn out to be higher if there is considerable damage to foundations and walls that is not immediately obvious.''"
"THE din along this city's waterfront does not come only from the procession of cars and trucks on the Alaskan Way Viaduct, an elevated highway over Elliott Bay that carries more than 105,000 vehicles a day. It also comes from the tumultuous civic dispute over a multibillion-dollar repair project involving the highway and the shoreline. In February 2001, Seattle was struck by the 6.8-magnitude Nisqually earthquake, which severely damaged the 53-year-old viaduct and the seawall holding it up. Everybody agrees that the seawall must be rebuilt, at a cost of roughly $1 billion. But in the nearly six years since the earthquake, the debate over what to do about the highway has grown more complex. Assertions by traffic engineers about the highway's central place in the region's transportation network -- it carries a fifth of Seattle's north-south traffic -- are colliding with new ideas about building a waterfront park above a six-lane tunnel, replacing the viaduct with a new one or building a park and a boulevard with no shoreline highway at all. The argument reflects the shifts that are occurring as American cities invest in infrastructure to become more economically competitive. Seattle is the latest city to weigh the value of replacing a 20th-century symbol of driving efficiency, designed to serve cars, with parks and boulevards, designed to enrich the human experience. ''Imagine our waterfront without the noise, blight and dirt from a nearby elevated freeway,'' wrote Greg Nickels, Seattle's mayor, in a 2004 article in The Seattle Times. ''Imagine walking along the waterfront and actually hearing the words of the person next to you, or hearing the cry of a seagull and the splash of the waves instead of rush hour.'' Essentially, Seattle has three options. One proposal, preferred by the speaker of the State Legislature, is to build a new and bigger elevated highway for about $3.3 billion. Another proposal, backed by the mayor and the City Council, is to build a six-lane tunnel, a shoreline boulevard and a waterfront park for about $5.5 billion, a plan supported by several of the city's most influential business and neighborhood groups. The population of Seattle, about 573,000, and surrounding King County, about 1.8 million, is growing fast. Demographers and economists expect downtown Seattle to add 56,000 new residents and 69,000 more jobs by 2020. ''The city's proposal for the Alaskan Way Tunnel is a three-for,'' said Grace Crunican, director of the city's Department of Transportation. ''The tunnel meets our transportation needs. We get a new seawall. And we get our waterfront back.'' The third idea, pursued by a citizens' group, the People's Waterfront Coalition, is to tear down the old highway, build a waterfront park and smaller boulevard, increase transit service and modernize existing streets. The coalition's proposal is based to some extent on the success of other cities, particularly San Francisco and Portland, Ore., which have replaced highways with waterfront parks and transit investments, and generated population gains and new economic vitality in neighborhoods once divided by highways. The coalition emphasizes one more point about its proposal -- its cost, which is under $1 billion. ''The question before us is, Can an American city voluntarily get rid of a moderately significant link in its transportation grid?'' said Clark Williams-Derry, 38, research director at Sightline Institute, a research center in Seattle, who helped the coalition refine its proposal. ''Can it be done politically? Can it be done substantively? What's clear is that it can be done substantively.'' When it was opened in 1953, the 2.2-mile-long viaduct represented the country's economic development priorities, providing drivers efficient routes from the central city to growing suburbs. Similar shoreline freeways were built in New York, Boston, San Francisco, Portland, Cleveland and other cities. But in the early years of the 21st century, Seattle's old wall of concrete has come to be viewed as a barrier to the city's quality of life. The viaduct has been accused of various civic offenses, including separating residents from easy access to natural resources, especially a spectacular shoreline. ''No one in the civilized world would build a double-decker freeway now on their beautiful waterfront if they had a good choice, which we do,'' said Sally Bagshaw, a lawyer, downtown resident and co-author of a report describing various plans for replacing the viaduct with a tunnel and waterfront park. But what Ms. Bagshaw calls a no-brainer is viewed as a potential calamity by many merchants in Pioneer Square, the historic section of Seattle close to the viaduct. ''The people I know aren't ready to swallow a tunnel,'' said John Siscoe, who owns the Globe Bookstore, citing cost overruns and delays experienced during Boston's $14.6 billion tunneling project known as the Big Dig. ''Oh, boy, what a mess we would be buying. Of all the options, we should forget the tunnel.'' Yet as city and state leaders argue over whether to build a tunnel or a new viaduct, the idea of doing neither seems to be gaining credence as the experiences of other cities that faced similar turning points are brought into the discussion. Cleveland is replacing the western section of its Memorial Shoreway, along Lake Erie, with a boulevard that is intended to spur development. Buffalo is debating whether to build a boulevard in place of its elevated Skyway along Lake Erie. Washington is considering demolishing its elevated Whitehurst Expressway to link Georgetown to a new park along the Potomac River. Milwaukee has already done so. The city spent $45 million to tear down the East Park Thruway in 2003, restored the street grid beneath it and freed up nearly 20 acres of land on the north side. ''The hardest part was convincing people that the highway wasn't needed,'' said John Norquist, a former mayor of Milwaukee and now president of the Congress for the New Urbanism, a design and planning group in Chicago. ''What happens is that traffic, for the most part, redistributes. Drivers have brains. They find other ways to get around.'' Cary Moon, an engineer and planner who directs the People's Waterfront Coalition from her downtown Seattle apartment, said that regardless of what is built, the viaduct would be coming down. For three or four years, there will be no highway at all along the waterfront. Seattle's traffic management plan calls for new transit service, improving streets, installing street signals and encouraging people to find alternatives. The city's plan is similar to the one proposed by Ms. Moon's group. ''We're going to find out that's all we really need,'' she said. URBAN OUTLOOK"
"Most of the Hawaiian Islands returned to normal Monday as state and local officials got their first look at the damage to roads, bridges and buildings caused by a strong earthquake on Sunday. The early morning quake was centered off the Kohala Coast on the western shore of Hawaii Island, known as the Big Island, where the most damage was immediately apparent. There were no deaths, and the most serious injuries reported were broken bones. The United States Geological Survey said that the main quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.6 and that there had been at least a dozen aftershocks, including one that measured 5.8. The quake and its aftershocks initially set off fears of a tsunami, but the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center on Oahu said no tsunami was expected because the quake was too deep underground. Gov. Linda Lingle issued a disaster declaration hours after the quake, and state officials were awaiting word from the White House. State and local officials said an assessment of the damage was not expected until midweek. On Oahu, where more than three-quarters of the state's 1.2 million people live, little damage was reported, but most of the island was without power for more than 12 hours. By Monday morning, all but a handful of communities on the island's Waianae Coast had electricity and rush-hour traffic was normal. People on the islands of Maui, Lanai and Molokai reported little damage and power was quickly restored. The focus Monday was on the Big Island, which was closest to the epicenter. Hawaii County officials were busy assessing damage to the highway that rings the island, particularly a section some 35 miles north of Hilo along the Hamakua Coast on the east side of the island, where a bridge was reported damaged. It was too early to say how many structures were damaged, but county officials estimated that hundreds of homes were affected. ''The challenge for us today is to get a good accurate picture of homes and businesses that were damaged and get the resources where they're needed,'' said Troy Kindred, Hawaii County civil defense administrator. Officials were also focusing on Kawaihae on the northwest side, where one of the island's two main commercial harbors was closed to shipping traffic because of damage. ''The pier buckled, said Janet Snyder, Mayor Harry Kim's press secretary. ''They have to send divers in to look underwater to see the damage to the pilings.'' North of Kawaihae, farmers and ranchers in the small communities of Hawi and Kapaau did not wait for county and state crews to clear the roadways of debris. One man took his backhoe and cleared one lane in Kapaau, said Jim Trump of Hawi, who runs Island Harvest, Inc., a 900-acre macadamia nut farm. ''A 100-foot old smokestack, a landmark, came crumbling down,'' Mr. Trump said. ''A lot of homes have been shaken off their foundations. Mr. Trump and his wife were taking a walk near their home in Hawi, on the northern tip of the island, when the shaking started. They clung to each other until it stopped, then ran home to find their two sons, ages 12 and 13, standing in the driveway. Then the strong aftershock came. ''It was surprising how severe it was,'' Mr. Trump said. The Kalahikiola Congregational Church in Kapaau, a historic church built in the 1850's by missionaries, was covered by a pile of rubble Monday after the stone porticos over the doors collapsed. Mr. Trump said that if people had been in the building during the quake, they would have rushed to that doorway. ''It was really fortunate that the time was early enough,'' he said. A few of the resorts along the Kohala Coast reported some damage, mostly broken glass and other items that were tossed around in the rooms. The governor, who was at the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel on Sunday morning when the quake hit, said a heavy television bounced off the dresser to the floor. Most of the patients evacuated from the Kona Community Hospital in Kealakekua had not returned to the 94-bed hospital by Monday, including 30 long-term care patients who were taken to the Sheraton Keauhou Hotel several miles away . Airline passengers stood in long lines at the Honolulu International Airport on Monday morning, waiting to pass through security checkpoints to board flights that had been canceled Sunday. At the interisland terminal, Hawaiian and Aloha airlines were back to normal after experiencing long delays on Sunday, when lines of passengers snaked their way out of the terminal and onto the driveway."
"The magnitude 6.7 earthquake that struck Hawaii last week, causing $100 million or more in damage, was followed within a few days by a 6.8 quake near Papua New Guinea, and a 6.4 temblor off Peru. Is there any connection between these events? Does one large earthquake in a region lead to another? Generally, no, said Cecily J. Wolfe, a seismologist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. More specifically, the Hawaiian quake, which damaged roads, buildings and bridges and knocked out power, was a different kind of earthquake than most of those that occur around the Pacific Rim. Earthquakes around the rim, like the Peruvian quake, result from the release of stresses that build up at the boundaries of tectonic plates. ''Out here in Hawaii, we're in the middle of the interior,'' Dr. Wolfe said. There are no plates sliding past each other. Instead, the stresses are a result of the sheer weight of the volcanoes that form the islands. As the volcanoes grow they put more pressure on the mantle below. ''It's like putting a big mass on a beam and the beam flexes,'' she said. The mantle only flexes to a point, however; eventually the stresses are released along a fault, causing a quake. In this case the fault was a deep one, some 25 miles underground, which helped keep the damage to a minimum. While strong earthquakes trigger nearby aftershocks (in Hawaii a shallower 5.8 quake occurred within minutes of the first one), they don't affect seismic zones hundreds of miles away. So why does it sometimes seem like there's a string of strong quakes throughout a region? That, Dr. Wolfe said, has more to do with psychology than seismology. The United States Geological Survey estimates that every two and a half days, on average, there is a quake of magnitude 6.0 or higher somewhere around the world. Many of these take place under the oceans or in remote land areas and are little noticed. But then one occurs in a place like Hawaii and earthquakes are in the news. So for a few days or weeks, every Tom, Dick and Harry of a quake is reported, and it feels as if there must be a connection. Even though there isn't. HENRY FOUNTAIN The Basics | 'Earthquakes'"
"An earthquake shook the walls of a two-story house in this suburb of Buffalo late Tuesday morning, sending wine glasses crashing to the floor, flower boxes plunging from second-story windows and a stuffed tiger plummeting from the bookshelf in a child's bedroom. The tremor was limited to a single structure built inside a laboratory at the University at Buffalo, intended to simulate the 1994 Northridge quake that shook Los Angeles. The 1,800-square-foot, three-bedroom house was the largest wooden building ever tested on such a simulator, built atop two ''shake plates'' that can be manipulated to resemble the earth's movement. The simulated earthquake, set off at 11:37 a.m., had a magnitude of 6.7, which is what the Northridge quake measured. Andre Filiatrault, an engineering professor at the university who supervised the test, said it was important to test wooden structures because 80 percent of the nation's buildings are made of wood, including 90 percent of the residential buildings. ''And yet,'' he said, ''we know very little of how they perform in earthquakes.'' The windows of the house shimmied during the 15-second simulation, but did not break. A station wagon in the garage moved sideways a few inches on the concrete floor. There were a few cracks in the house's stucco siding, but no structural damage was evident. ''The structure did very well -- it didn't collapse,'' said John W. van de Lindt, a professor at Colorado State University who is the principal investigator on a four-year national project aimed at improving the safety and economics of wood-frame construction. ''If the contents were correctly anchored, you would have survived in that building, no doubt.'' The imaginary occupants of the house would not even have had all that much cleaning up to do. In the dining room, a full water pitcher on the table remained full and on the table, while an infant's swing stayed upright. In a bedroom, with T-shirts tacked on the wall from each of the universities involved in the project -- Cornell, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Texas A&M joined Buffalo and Colorado State -- a computer monitor and a television fell to the floor. But in another bedroom, where a child's bookshelf, a television and a dresser were anchored in place as recommended in earthquake zones, the furnishings did not fall. And in the garage, a hot water heater that was secured as required by California law stayed put, while an unsecured one next to it toppled as soon as the test began. The house was built to California housing codes, with stucco siding and clay roof shingles more commonly found on the West Coast than in western New York. It had already withstood several smaller test quakes since construction began in June. Construction on the house included techniques common since the Northridge earthquake, like using larger washers when bolting a sill plate to the concrete floor to prevent lifting. One of the project's goals was to compare long-term savings on repairs after earthquakes with higher initial construction costs. ''We're looking at, 'How do you minimize the cost of the structure over its lifetime?' '' Mr. van de Lindt said. ''If you're the owner, over 40 or 50 years in California, you may go through more than one earthquake. So what can you do? It might cost a little more initially, but then, statistically, we can figure out that it would actually be less expensive over your lifetime.'' The next step in the project will be analyzing data gathered from the 250 sensors throughout the house to assist in the designing of even larger wooden structures. ''Tall buildings, four or five stories, are going up right now in places like the Pacific Northwest, but nobody knows too much about how they'll react in an earthquake,'' Mr. Filiatrault said. Researchers plan to design a six-story wooden house to be tested in 2009 on the world's largest earthquake simulator, in Kobe, Japan, site of a devastating quake in 1995. Tuesday's test here marked the completion of the first year of the $1.24 million project, which is being financed by the National Science Foundation. Earthquake research has been taking place at the University of Buffalo since the 1960s; the school received $21 million in federal and state financing in 2001 to build the laboratory where the test took place. Despite the lack of visible damage to the test house, Mr. Filiatrault said he was unsure whether a similar structure would be immediately habitable after a real quake. ''If I was the owner of this house and I was in California, I would probably sleep in the backyard for a couple of nights and get an engineer to check it out,'' he said."
"Last month, early on a Sunday morning, an earthquake struck the Hawaiian Islands, damaging schools, roads and businesses. It shook people awake, caused widespread power failures and jolted a machine about 5,000 miles away in the Bronx. There, in an underground vault at Fordham University, a small steel cylinder picked up the tremor. This little device and generations of its predecessors have been recording the rumblings of the earth for nearly 100 years at the Jesuit university. Since 1910, when a chemistry instructor, the Rev. Edward P. Tivnan, installed a seismograph in the basement of the administration building, Fordham has been the site of the oldest seismic station in New York City. It is an unlikely place to measure the earth's vibrations: inside a musty room 28 feet below the comings and goings of a borough of 1.3 million known for many things, but not tectonic activity. Yet over the years the university's William Spain Seismic Observatory has become a respected if little-known registrar of the world's natural and unnatural trembling, including earthquakes, China's first atomic explosion in 1964 and the more local seismic occurrences, Grand Central-bound trains. In Father Tivnan's time, quakes were recorded on a Wiechert seismograph, a pendulum contraption with levers, kerosene-smoked paper and a 180-pound weight balanced on a rod. The Wiechert was succeeded by more advanced machines, the latest being a CMG-3TD, a computerized seismometer made by Güralp Systems that resembles a giant coffee thermos. The station opened in 1924 and sits at the edge of a wide lawn in the center of campus, next to Freeman Hall, home of the department of physics. That Gothic stone building looks more like a country chapel than a seismic station. There is no need to walk softly around it, though long ago the instruments were deemed so sensitive that the grass outside the observatory was trimmed not by machine, but by horse. The tall wooden door of Freeman Hall bears a gift from Pope Pius XI, a bronze plaque emblazoned with an image of St. Emidio, the divine protector against earthquakes. Inside, down a steep flight of steps, rests the CMG-3TD, on a block of concrete poured onto the bedrock below, when the station was first built. The only sound in the dimly lighted room comes from the whir of a dehumidifier in a corner. The cylinder is about a foot tall. The black handle on top sends a mixed message: Touching is strictly prohibited. Its steel panels prevent anyone from peeking inside. It makes no noise, not even when it detects a quake that has split roads and walls on another continent. This is the irony of the machine in an earthquake. As the world shifts, the parts of its sensors that are suspended remain still, and the part of its sensors attached to the outer frame move. It is stillness and movement, together. ''It's a beautifully engineered thing -- not that I've ever seen the inside of it,'' said Benjamin C. Crooker, an associate professor of physics. Professor Crooker supervises the seismometer and looks after the observatory, which is named in honor of William Spain, a physics student who died in 1922 and whose father donated the money to build the station. For more than 60 years, the observatory's keeper was the Rev. J. Joseph Lynch, an earthquake expert whom students, city officials and reporters frequently consulted for seismic instruction and information. ''Earthquakes are like snakes,'' he told a reporter for The New York Times in 1952. ''They avoid people more than is generally realized.'' In 1960, a typical year, Father Lynch recorded about 250 large earthquakes. A beam of light traced the quakes' signatures onto rolls of photographic paper. Over the years, the Fordham machines picked up construction blasts, Bronx traffic, a 6 a.m. milk train rushing past the nearby Fordham train station and the curious lines left on the photographic paper by unwelcome visitors -- spiders -- that had crawled onto the instruments. Jesuits, known for centuries for their interest in the natural sciences, were instrumental in the development of seismology, and Father Lynch was one in a long line of Jesuit seismologists whose faith in God infused his work. In the early 1950s, he conducted seismic tests in Rome to help the Vatican search for the tomb of St. Peter. Some of Father Lynch's old seismometers, now out of service, are on display in the station, on concrete blocks near the more modern device. The station went out of service after Father Lynch died in 1987, at 92, but it was brought back to life in 1994 by Jay Mancini, then the chairman of the physics department, and Victor Aiello, a former student of Father Lynch's and a retired electrical engineer. The university's current seismometer can detect a large earthquake anywhere in the world. Earthquakes send out seismic waves that travel the earth, like ripples in a pond. These waves can be picked up by sensors that detect ground motion in three planes: east-west, north-south and vertical. ''If I take something like the rail of a train and I hit it with a sledgehammer, then somebody miles away would eventually be able to hear that sound pulse,'' Professor Crooker said. ''An earthquake is a very similar thing. It really gives a smash to the earth, and waves travel out from that earthquake in all directions.'' It took just 11 minutes and 18 seconds for the first waves from last month's Hawaii earthquake to reach New York. The vibrations were picked up on Fordham's seismometer. Its readings are displayed on a computer in a storage room of Freeman Hall and then relayed over the Internet. The physics department's Web site posts the readings of the machine around the clock. Fordham's seismometer is part of a network of similar machines that monitor earthquake activity in the northeastern United States. The network, coordinated by the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, is made up of seismic stations in New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Vermont. It supplies data to a larger national network, the Advanced National Seismic System, operated by the United States Geological Survey. The Fordham seismometer is one of three in New York City linked to the regional and national networks. The other two are located at a lab in the middle of Central Park and at Queens College. Though not as busy as their counterparts in California, seismometers in the New York metropolitan region pick up an unexpected amount of local earthquake activity. Since the 1700s, New York City has been struck by at least 18 earthquakes with magnitudes estimated at 2.4 to 5.2, according to seismologists at Lamont-Doherty in Palisades, N.Y. One of the strongest earthquakes in city history took place the afternoon of Aug. 10, 1884, alarming New Yorkers and toppling chimneys but causing little significant damage. The quake's magnitude was estimated at 5.2. The devastating 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which caused the collapse of the double-decker Cypress Freeway in Oakland, Calif., and disrupted the World Series, had a magnitude of 7.1. The most recent New York City earthquake detected by the Fordham seismometer was a minor one, one of magnitude 0.8, on Dec. 12, 2004. It was centered in the area of East 57th Street and the East River and was followed by three smaller aftershocks, said Won-Young Kim, senior research scientist at the Lamont-Doherty observatory. Inside Fordham's vault, of late a second seismometer has sat next to the cylinder, bolted to the concrete. It is a strong-motion sensor, which is part of the Lamont-Doherty regional network and is paid for by the United States Geological Survey. The seismometer is designed to helpseismologists and engineers understand how the ground and buildings respond to large or moderate earthquakes that originate close by. Luckily, it has yet to be used. Correction: November 23, 2006, Thursday Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about the William Spain Seismic Observatory at Fordham University in the Bronx, the oldest seismic station in New York City, misstated the location of a plaque of St. Emidio, the divine protector against earthquakes. It is on the door of the observatory building, not on Freeman Hall, which is nearby."
"Three days after a powerful earthquake rocked central Java, many devastated villages within the two worst-hit districts have yet to receive any help, residents said Tuesday. Swarms of aid workers flew into Yogyakarta's airport and descended on the Bantul and Klaten districts, the two most severely damaged areas, causing traffic to be rerouted to ease congestion. But the villages in these districts, a lush farming region south of Yogyakarta, are spread thinly among large rice paddies and connected only by single-lane roads. In one village, Tegal Dowo, residents rooted through rubble in the blazing sun on Tuesday afternoon. They said no relief agencies had yet made contact with them, and they pleaded for help from the international community. ''We have barely enough food and supplies to survive,'' said Iwan, 37, whose village was leveled. ''I don't know how to live anymore.'' Amfani, 40, who pulled his wife out of his wrecked home Saturday morning, only to watch her die by the side of the road, said he was now worried about his two young sons. ''Please send money, send food,'' he said, adjusting his footing as an aftershock rumbled underneath him. ''My family is desperate. Our market, our only source of income, was destroyed.'' The official death toll rose to roughly 5,700, according to news agency reports, with about 15,000 injured and more than 100,000 homeless. Some officials think those numbers will rise because more wrecked villages have been discovered by the military and aid agencies southeast of Bantul. ''People are just starting to realize that there is more destruction outside of Bantul and Klaten,'' said Paul Armour, country manager for Catholic Relief Services. In the Gunung Kibul district, southeast of Bantul, bodies were still being pulled from collapsed houses, he said. Mr. Armour's team had gone to Yogyakarta two weeks ago to coordinate relief for a possible eruption of Mount Merapi, a volcano north of the city that has been stirring lately. Mount Merapi continued to rumble Tuesday, with lava bubbling from its crater and streaming down, merging with rivers below. The 9,800-foot mountain also released a number of hot gas clouds throughout the day; when they descend, they can burn people severely or even kill them. Volcanologists fear the collapse of the mountain's lava dome, which they said would set off a large eruption. Some believe the dome was weakened after the quake on Saturday. Like other organizations, Oxfam International on Tuesday began focusing its relief effort on the outlying communities. ''Reaching people in the more remote villages has been challenging, but we're confident that we'll very soon be delivering aid to those people who've been cut off from relief until now,'' Craig Owen, an Oxfam spokesman who arrived from Aceh this week, said in a statement. A steady flow of aid, however, continued to arrive Tuesday, as relief agencies and other groups surveyed the area and started distributing supplies. Helicopters buzzed above ruined towns for the first time since the quake. United States marines helped in the distribution effort. Ambulances continued to race between villages and overcrowded hospitals. Earlier this week, the Indonesian Finance Ministry told the United Nations that it would provide subsistence grants to survivors and grants to help rebuild homes. The government intends to complete a rehabilitation plan in two weeks. In Yogyakarta, a major tourist destination and center of classical Javanese culture, life was returning to normal. Despite serious structural damage to some larger buildings like malls and universities, many stores reopened and residents returned to their jobs. Electricity across the city of half a million was restored. Fears of disease began surfacing Tuesday as displaced residents packed into makeshift tents set up by local communities. The World Health Organization sent a surveillance team to Yogyakarta to monitor possible epidemics of measles, diarrhea and other sicknesses easily spread in unsanitary conditions. ''These epidemics happen when displaced persons are tightly packed together and often lacking basic infrastructure, such as clean water and safe sewage disposal,'' said Dick Thompson, a World Health Organization spokesman. Although the stench of decomposing bodies was evident in some areas, most families immediately buried their relatives. A mass grave was dug in Bantul for unidentified people, said Sudibyo, a forensic doctor from Yogyakarta who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name. A number of those bodies were driven in ambulances on Tuesday afternoon from hospitals to the mass grave in the village of Dukuh Kurahahan. There, about 20 men, buckets in hand, bailed out the rainwater that had accumulated in the grave the night before. Donning surgery masks, they tossed the bodies in. Standing barefoot in the mud, one villager said a short prayer before the team started filling in the grave using crude shovels, sticks and their hands."
"Rescue workers and military and police units scoured this ravaged historic city in central Java through the night, using searchlights to find survivors of a powerful earthquake that struck early Saturday, leveling homes, hotels and bridges. Residents began digging mass graves to bury the bodies lining the streets. The United States Geological Survey recorded two other earthquakes east of Indonesia Sunday afternoon, one with a 6.2 magnitude off the coast of Papua New Guinea, and another of 6.7 magnitude near Tonga. No deaths were reported there. The death toll in the Indonesia quake, which had a magnitude of 6.3, had risen to nearly 3,500, according to government officials cited by news services. Aftershocks repeatedly rattled the area, about 250 miles east of the capital, Jakarta, as the injured were taken to hospitals over cracked roads on flatbed trucks, vans, buses and even motorbikes. The earthquake set off increased activity at a nearby volcano, Mount Merapi, which shot hot gas clouds and volcanic rocks down its slopes soon after the earthquake. Many residents first thought the earthquake was the long expected eruption. A driving rain began late Saturday night, and major hospitals set up tents in their parking lots to try to protect the overflowing masses of the injured. At one hospital, many victims lay on the wet ground with only newspaper beneath them. Nurses ran in and out, ferrying quickly dwindling supplies. Yogyakarta, with a densely packed population of half a million, is the cultural center of Java, and is a popular tourist destination. One of the main hotel districts was badly damaged, but there were few immediate reports of fatalities there. Officials said that, at the least, tens of thousands of residents had been left homeless. Survivors camped outside their houses or what was left of them, or in the many rice fields in the area, huddling in the rain around small fires. Electricity remained out in much of the southern half of the city. In the hardest hit part of the Yogyakarta area, Bantul, Mayor Idham Samawi said that rescuers had counted 2,200 dead and that many more people were alive but trapped under thousands of collapsed buildings. The epicenter of the earthquake, which struck just before 6 a.m., was about 15 miles southwest of Yogyakarta on the southern coast of Java along the Indian Ocean, and about six miles below the surface. Fearing a tsunami, many residents fled for higher ground, but the ocean brought no further destruction. Rescue efforts got under way quickly, with some emergency workers already stationed in Yogyakarta (pronounced JOG-jakarta), and evacuation points already designated because Mount Merapi has been showing signs of impending eruption for months. Indonesia has the largest number of active volcanoes in the world. Subandriyo, director of the Merapi division of Yogyakarta's Volcanology Center, said he expected activity at Mount Merapi to increase as shockwaves continued to disturb the mountain. If the large lava dome that has been forming for months is dislodged, he said, a serious eruption could follow. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono ordered the army to help evacuate victims, The Associated Press reported, and arrived Saturday in the province with a team of cabinet ministers. He slept in a tent camp with survivors. Some international relief agencies also managed to get quickly to Yogyakarta to ease the burden of local hospitals, and to expand search and rescue operations. The earthquake cracked the runway at the airport in Yogyakarta, forcing it to be closed, but it was not clear how that would affect relief efforts. Expressions of shock and condolence, paired with pledges of aid, began to flow into Indonesia. Malaysia said it would send a 56-member search team, doctors and medical supplies, the A.P. said, and the European Commission said it would release up to $3.8 million in emergency aid. In Washington, President Bush said in a statement released late Saturday: ''On behalf of the American people, Laura and I send our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those who lost their lives in the devastating earthquake in Indonesia. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Indonesian people as they comfort all those affected by this terrible disaster. ''Through financial and material support, the United States is assisting with recovery efforts in coordination with Indonesian authorities, and we stand prepared to provide additional assistance as needed.'' The Associated Press reported that the United States was allocating $2.5 million in emergency aid money for Indonesia. The need here is escalating rapidly. A doctor with the Indonesian Red Cross, who was volunteering at the hospital in Bantul, said that all the hospitals in the area were teeming with victims and that the situation was becoming desperate. ''We're running out of anesthetic, thread and bandages,'' the doctor, Lydia Setyawati, said. ''And we can only give early treatment. We don't have the specialists to treat some victims.'' At Bantul Muhammadiyah Hospital, the closest hospital to the quake's epicenter, an official, Kusmarwanto, said he had counted 39 bodies, The Associated Press reported. ''We need help here,'' he said. Thousands of residents, mostly women and children , huddled at the evacuation points. Some said they lacked food and water. One of the city's historic sites is the Borobudur Buddhist temple, which is more than 1,000 years old and is on Unesco's list of World Heritage sites. Officials said late Saturday that it did not appear that the temple had been significantly damaged. Nearby Prambanan, a Hindu temple, was reported to have suffered at least some damage."
"Two weeks before a scheduled test of a warning system for tsunamis around the Pacific basin, a magnitude-7.9 earthquake yesterday off the islands of Tonga provided a more urgent, unscheduled test, briefly causing tsunami fears from New Zealand to Hawaii. Tidal gauges recorded a tsunami resulting from the earthquake, but the peak-to-trough height was only about 17 inches, not large enough to cause damage. No deaths were reported from the earthquake. The earthquake occurred about 100 miles northeast of Nukualofa, one of the islands of Tonga, at 4:26 a.m. local time. The United States Geological Survey initially estimated the magnitude at 8.0, large enough to be regarded as ''great,'' but only at the threshold of the magnitude that might generate a dangerous tsunami. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii issued a warning 17 minutes after the earthquake for coastal areas around the Pacific. An hour later, the center downgraded the warning to only the region within 600 miles of the epicenter, and an hour after that, it canceled the alert. The earthquake occurred along the boundary where the Indian-Australian tectonic plate meets the Pacific plate. It was about 34 miles below the surface and did not greatly deform the ocean bottom. The deformation of the ocean floor, shifting large amounts of water, is the direct cause of tsunamis. ''This was really the perfect event,'' said Gerard Fryer, a geophysicist at the tsunami warning center. ''It was in an area that wasn't populated, and there was a tide gauge within 300 miles where we could see it, and we were able to get a warning out in good time.'' He added, ''Fortunately, it wasn't necessary.'' There are still problems in the system. Tonga, for instance, did not receive the warning because of a power failure. On May 16, as part of a drill organized by Unesco, the warning center will begin the exercise by sending out a mock tsunami warning. That will allow the authorities in different countries to measure how long it takes to disperse the warning to emergency personnel."
"The Mexican government has tapped international markets to issue a special catastrophe bond to finance rescue and rebuilding in case of a disastrous earthquake, finance ministry officials said on Friday. The $160 million bond is part of a larger $450 million insurance package over the next three years that will cost the Mexican government $26 million. Mexico is considered more at risk for a strong earthquake than even California, and the memory of the 1985 earthquake is still vivid for many residents of Mexico City. The death toll in that disaster may have been as high as 20,000. Despite the risks, the government has not bought insurance until now, said José Antonio González Anaya, the finance ministry official who has spent three years trying to structure the deal. Investors who buy the bonds are essentially betting that an earthquake will not hit Mexico in the next three years. Swiss Re, the Zurich-based reinsurance group, issued the bonds, which pay 230 basis points over the Libor benchmark interest rate. ''If there's no disaster in three years,'' the finance minister, Francisco Gil Diáz, said, ''the investors keep the premium and the interest'' and get back the bond. But if a quake hits, the government gets the full value of the bonds, and investors lose their money. Catastrophe bonds were started in the 1990's, and have largely been issued by private companies to cover losses from natural disasters. Taiwan is the only other government that has issued such a bond against a quake, but it covers damages from losses. In Mexico's case, the government collects the $450 million in the bonds and the insurance payout if a quake of 7.5 or 8 magnitude on the Richter scale hits specific regions, regardless of damage. Mr. González Anaya said that meant the government would have money for rescue operations immediately after a disaster. Mexico has a special fund for natural disasters but the fund has only $80 million. Last year, the Mexican government spent $1.2 billion to cover rescue and rebuilding operations after Hurricanes Stan and Wilma. Mr. González Anaya hopes to issue a similar kind of catastrophe bond against hurricanes."
"In a blistering report issued Monday about San Francisco's disaster preparedness, an auditor suggested that the city's office of emergency services was a top-heavy bureaucracy that might be ill-equipped to deal with a catastrophe like an earthquake or a terrorist attack. The report, by Harvey M. Rose, a budget analyst for the city's board of supervisors, detailed problems like outdated information in disaster plans and the placement of emergency sirens on buildings that might be unstable in an earthquake. The report did credit the agency, the Office of Emergency Services and Homeland Security, with increasing the number of disaster exercises and plans in recent years, a period in which the city was allocated more than $80 million in government grants for such purposes. But it also questioned the office's hiring of 19 new staff members, many of them managers, while it spent little to improve on-the-ground emergency response. ''What's possibly putting this city at risk is that we've received $82 million in government grants'' and spent only $23 million, Mr. Rose said in a telephone interview. ''Either this money is justified and should be expended, or it should be returned to the government.'' The report said that 51 percent of the money spent had been for personnel and that only 1 percent had gone to emergency training. Annemarie Conroy, who has led the emergency office since August 2004, disputed some of the report's findings, in particular the assertion about the money devoted to training, putting the figure at closer to 25 percent to 30 percent. ''We're an office that's in a growth period, a ramp-up period, and the work product coming out of this office I'd match against any office in San Francisco,'' said Ms. Conroy, who cited letters of support from 30 government and private organizations included in the report. Mr. Rose conceded that some of the office's personnel expenses might include overtime expenses for emergency workers. Ms. Conroy said that some of the issues raised predated her tenure and that her office had accomplished many significant tasks, including updating a citywide emergency operations plan and creating a database of local shelters and a Web site devoted to preparedness. ''We're putting San Francisco on a new level,'' she said. The report considered the city's preparation for manmade and natural disasters and found fault with both. It said the emergency operations center for the medical examiner was in a building that might not survive a major earthquake. And it cited a March exercise in which some emergency responders did not know which radio channel to use, reminiscent of a problem for firefighters at the World Trade Center during the 2001 terrorist attacks. Lawrence M. Wein, a professor of management science at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., who has studied domestic security, said many cities had struggled to improve their terrorism response plans since Sept. 11. ''Most cities and states hardly gave it a thought before that,'' Dr. Wein said. As for earthquake preparation, he said the Bay Area had few excuses. ''Since 1906, we should have had a good plan in place,'' he said, referring to the earthquake that devastated San Francisco. ''We've known about those things for a number of years.''"
"Sugiarto, a 50-year-old chicken farmer, spent Sunday night lying immobile with a severe back injury at the edge of a crowded tarp outside Bantul General Hospital, his wife shielding his face as rain whipped down. Mr. Sugiarto said his back was broken when the roof of his house fell on him in the 6.3 magnitude earthquake on Saturday. He was first turned away from the hospital because his injuries were not considered serious enough amid the devastation in Bantul, a district eight miles south of Yogyakarta where most of the deaths occurred. ''We returned to our mosque, where we sat out front and prayed,'' said his wife, Ngatinah, 43. ''We prayed all night in the rain.'' Neighbors drove them in a pickup truck. Like most people here, they refuse to stay inside, terrified of the aftershocks that come every few hours. Mr. Sugiarto, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, was back at the hospital awaiting treatment for a second day in a row. He lay on nothing more than a plastic sheet next to the hospital parking lot. The earthquake has killed more than 4,500 people, the Indonesian government said Sunday. The number of deaths is expected to rise as rescue workers search the rubble of collapsed buildings, and aftershocks continue to quiver through Yogyakarta and surrounding areas. Mount Merapi, a volcano north of Yogyakarta, has been expected to erupt for the past few weeks, and it seemed to become more threatening on Monday morning, venting ever larger clouds of hot gas into the air, that then slid down its slopes. Volcanologists say the earthquake probably caused the increased activity in the volcano. The epicenter of the earthquake, which struck just before 6 a.m. on Saturday, was about 15 miles southwest of Yogyakarta on the southern coast of Java along the Indian Ocean, and about 6 miles below the surface. John Budd, a Unicef spokesman, said tens of thousands had been injured and at least 100,000 left homeless, nearly half of them children. The issue of how efficiently help is coming to the quake's victims was raised Sunday, but aid workers here were quick to note that there was no comparison to be made between the relatively modest earthquake on Saturday and far more devastating quakes in Pakistan and Pakistani-administered Kashmir last October, which killed 75,000, and in Iran in 2003, which killed 31,000, let alone the tsunami, which killed 181,000 people in Southeast Asia in 2004. Two other earthquakes east of Indonesia were recorded Sunday, one off the coast of Papua New Guinea, and another near Tonga. No deaths or damages were reported. In Bantul, overwhelmed hospital employees working in blood-stained hallways teeming with sick and injured patients welcomed the arrival of emergency supplies Sunday night, though United Nations officials said they expected most of the aid to arrive Monday. Relief efforts have been stalled partly because the Yogyakarta airport is closed, after its runway was cracked and a terminal building partly collapsed. Aid workers have been diverted to nearby airports in Solo and Semarang. Limited emergency air service was expected to resume Monday at the airport, but it would still be a day or two before it could support any sustained traffic, officials said. Apart from the airport, however, Yogyakarta's infrastructure was mostly intact, allowing the government and aid agencies to get help to the area relatively quickly. Military trucks carrying supplies from the central government thundered past the lush rice paddies of the area's farming communities Sunday night from the capital, Jakarta, 250 miles west of Yogyakarta. Yolak Dalimunte, in charge of disaster response for the Indonesian Social Welfare Ministry, said supplies of tents, food, beds and clothing were beginning to arrive in Bantul, where a command center had been set up to coordinate relief efforts. Puji Pujiono, the lead officer for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said that although the government had yet to officially request United Nations assistance, the agency had been talking to local officials and had set up a communications center next to the Bantul mayor's office. ''The next 36 hours are going to be a logistical nightmare,'' he said. ''We have a small pipeline where a lot of aid is being pumped through. We are going to face a bottleneck if we don't figure this out soon.'' Mr. Pujiono said a meeting was planned among aid groups and the Indonesian government to help coordinate rescue efforts. Other aid officials said the Indonesian government had so far responded efficiently to the earthquake. ''The response from the government has been electric and focused,'' said Mr. Budd of Unicef, who was to meet with the Indonesian finance minister and other United Nations agencies on Monday to assess the extent of the damage in Yogyakarta. ''They assessed what was required and responded quickly.'' At Bantul General Hospital, where pieces of the roof were missing and walls were fissured, Mercy Corps, a disaster relief group, was distributing supplies and assessing patients' needs. Liha, a spokeswoman for Mercy Corps who goes by one name, said relief needed to come faster because the hospital was rapidly running out of antibiotics, anesthetics, bandages and, most urgently, food. ''Most people are suffering from bone fractures, but what we really need is food supplies,'' she said, standing amid a crowd of bloodied people clamoring for help. ''Most of these people haven't eaten since the earthquake.'' In Jetis, an area in Bantul, more than 300 houses were leveled. Neighbors climbing over a wrecked house spotted the bodies of a family of three and began frantically digging them out Sunday morning. But no amount of effort could free the bodies from the layers of debris. Hours later, the neighbors were still waiting for military personnel to help. The bodies remained buried and were not part of the official death toll until well into the evening Sunday. In sweltering heat, residents of Jetis carried all the belongings they could salvage to a central location Sunday afternoon, where they divided them among the neediest. ''I am devastated,'' said Prapto Warsito, the village leader for Jetis, who sat at the side of the road surrounded by rubble, holding a cardboard box for donations."
"Significant amounts of aid began arriving Monday in Bantul, the town south of this city that was hit the hardest by Saturday's earthquake, but a nearby volcano substantially increased its threatening activity. For the third night in a row, residents in Bantul and in Klaten, another badly ravaged town, slept outside their houses, grouped around campfires and used debris for cover from the sporadic rain. Some softly strummed guitars, while others, kneeling on mats, prayed for help. Mount Merapi, a towering 9,800-foot volcano north of Yogyakarta, has been close to an eruption for nearly a month, but activity weakened in recent weeks. Volcanologists said Monday that the powerful quake destabilized a fragile dome at the mountain's peak. Collapse of the dome would set off a large eruption of lava, rocks and hot gas, they said. Large, billowing clouds of gas were vented from the mountain's crater on Monday, drifting more than two miles down its western slope toward the village of Magelang. Subandriyo, director of the Merapi division of the Volcanology Center here, said the volcano released 150 gaseous clouds on Monday, compared with an average of 50 the week before. ''Residents living in the danger areas on the slopes of the volcano have again begun to evacuate,'' he said. ''The danger is growing as activity increases.'' South of Yogyakarta, the death toll from the earthquake on Saturday rose to about 5,000, with more than 15,000 injured and 100,000 displaced, according to government figures released Monday. Puji Pujiono, the lead officer of the United Nations team in Bantul, said it was receiving no new reports of missing persons, a sign that the number of deaths might not increase much in the coming days. Emergency teams previously deployed in Yogyakarta for the expected eruption of Mount Merapi have shifted their resources to Bantul, where a command center for the rescue effort has been established. A communications post there is monitoring the volcano's activity and keeping emergency workers informed of developments. Activity at the command center in Bantul was high Monday afternoon as government, military and international aid workers, forming human chains, unloaded rice, water and other supplies. The Indonesian Finance Ministry told United Nations officials on Monday evening that it would provide subsistence grants to survivors of the quake. The ministry also said it would provide grants to families, administered by local government, to help rebuild houses. It intends to complete a full action plan for rehabilitation in two weeks. Despite heavy rain during the last three nights, officials said they did not expect large numbers of deaths from disease or hunger. Many residents are staying near their homes and in their villages, where they have been able to share salvaged food, clothing and shelter. But villagers who were ill or injured continued arriving at seriously overburdened hospitals on Monday afternoon. Officials said medical workers and hospital supplies were now the most urgent need. To partly relieve overcrowding, the Indonesian Red Cross began transferring patients with minor injuries to hospitals in Yogyakarta and to emergency tents in the quake area. The United States military said it would provide 100 doctors, nurses and medical technicians. A United Nations team from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs began organizing the arrival of aid groups on Sunday. Daily meetings have been held to share information and coordinate the use of resources. Electricity in Yogyakarta, a city of half a million, has been fully restored, and the airport, which was damaged during the quake, reopened Monday to emergency and commercial traffic. Aid shipments had been diverted to nearby airports in Solo and Semarang, where the relief groups loaded supplies and personnel onto trucks and vans bound for Bantul. The convoy of trucks caused heavy traffic along the road to Bantul, further delaying aid. ''There is a huge need here,'' said Mr. Pujiono, the United Nations official. ''We are not lacking supplies, but they are being held up by a jammed distribution system.'' On Monday, trucks, cars and motorbikes continued to wait in dense traffic on the one-lane road to Bantul, while villagers lined the street holding plastic cups and cardboard boxes begging for food and money. Emergency shelters were only beginning to go up on Monday. Andi Hanindito, chief of disaster response for the Indonesian Social Welfare Ministry, said the delay was partly because local government workers, who were caught in the quake, were only now returning to work. Relief groups, many of which were coming from Aceh Province in western Sumatra, where there was widespread destruction from the tsunami at the end of 2004, said their experience there helped them carry out the relief effort in Yogyakarta. Many aid group leaders are already acquainted with the United Nations staff members and government officials responding to the emergency here. ''Everyone is switched on here, and a lot of us know each other,'' said Rae McGrath, country director for International Medical Corps. ''Authorities here have so far been sensible and supportive.'' Local government officials have not been attending the daily coordination meetings, and the national government has yet to make a formal request for assistance from the United Nations. But Mr. Pujiono said he had been meeting regularly with local officials and communicating their concerns to other groups. The Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, temporarily moved his offices to Yogyakarta on Sunday, bringing greater pressure on the provincial government to respond efficiently."
"Thousands of residents of this coastal community huddled together in makeshift camps on the crest of nearby hills on Tuesday night, fearing a repeat of Monday's tsunami, which killed more than 300 people and injured hundreds more. Most villagers said they had been taken by surprise when the wall of water about six feet high pounded the shore, leveling houses and hotels up to a quarter of a mile from the shore. Debris blocked roads, and cars and small boats carried inland by the waves littered the coconut groves. A 7.7 magnitude earthquake in the Indian Ocean at around 3:15 p.m. Monday set off the tsunami, but residents said they had barely felt the quake, and realized the danger only after the ocean quickly receded -- a sign of a coming tsunami. ''The tremors were not strong, so I felt no need to worry,'' said Mumu, a local businessman whose 15 tourist cottages were reduced to hollow frames. ''But then I heard the screams of the people on the beach, and when I looked over the fence the water was rushing toward me.'' Pangandaran, a usually vibrant tourist community, was eerily quiet on Tuesday as residents moved to camps farther inland to spend the night. The flicker of flashlights scanning the rubble for survivors was the only sign of life along the coastal road, which was lined with popular hotels, cottages, seaside restaurants and cafes. Ambulances and Indonesian military vehicles raced back and forth from the coast to inland hospitals carrying the injured throughout the day as bodies continued to wash up on the beach. Officials from the Indonesian Social Welfare Ministry made preparations to take rubber speedboats out early Wednesday morning to search for more bodies, which they said they expected to find, indicating the death toll could still increase. About 40,000 people have abandoned their homes for higher ground, according to Indonesia's disaster coordination unit, making it hard to tally the numbers of dead, injured and missing. Residents said the Indonesian military arrived in the Pangandaran area just hours after the waves struck, clearing roads and transporting villagers to safety. Local and international aid organizations began to trickle in on Tuesday. But many relief groups, already working at maximum capacity after a May 27 earthquake near Yogyakarta in Central Java killed 5,700 people and left more than a million homeless, said they planned to wait a few more days to assess the area's need before shifting their resources from Yogyakarta or from Banda Aceh, where a much larger tsunami killed 170,000 people in 2004. At one makeshift camp, outside a school perched on a hill in the village of Cikembulan, about 2,000 people huddled together to keep warm as they slept on the ground. No tents had arrived and many were weak from hunger. Ridwan, a 29-year-old doctor from Ibu, an Indonesian nongovernment organization, arrived at the camp on Tuesday morning and said more help was desperately needed. ''The community here set this camp up,'' he said. ''Nobody from the government or anyone else is here yet to help with logistics.'' He said he had treated about 150 patients who had arrived with bruises, cuts and broken bones but said the more pressing need was food. Some residents set up impromptu clinics to care for neighbors. At one, a retired nurse cared for nearly 100 people herself. By nighttime she was forced to turn villagers away because she had run out of medical supplies -- supplies she had provided from her own house. ''I cannot do anything anymore, I can no longer help because I have no supplies,'' the nurse, Meliana, said standing outside a mosque where a family, in tears, received the body of a dead relative discovered on the beach. ''I am in shock after all this.'' The tsunami affected more than 100 miles of coastline in West Java, though most of the destruction was in only a few miles of beach in the Ciamis region, where Pangandaran, the hardest hit area is located. A tsunami early-warning system was established in Sumatra after the tsunami in Aceh, the northern tip of Sumatra, in 2004. But the government has yet to establish a similar system for Java. ''This surely points to the need to establish an effective warning system,'' said Michael Kocher, country manager for the Indonesian Rescue Committee, who has been working in Aceh for more than a year. ''Surely this isn't the last tsunami we'll see in Indonesia.'' The government plans to have a warning system in place for Java by 2007, three years after Aceh's devastation and too late for many in this West Java town. ''We had no idea we were in any danger,'' said Mumu, the owner of the destroyed tourist cottages, standing outside his ruined home. ''I only started to run when the water came crashing through the concrete wall around my house.''"
"A powerful undersea earthquake struck off the south coast of Java, Indonesia, on Monday afternoon, creating a tsunami that killed scores of people. The Indonesian Red Cross put the death toll at 155 as of Tuesday morning, and officials continued to sort through debris looking for bodies. The wave was about six feet high, considerably smaller than those that hit Aceh and elsewhere in the region in December 2004, killing more than 200,000 people. But it carried a tremendous amount of destructive power, and seemed to have hit hardest at Pangandaran, a beach town popular with Indonesians and foreigners. The wave heaved boats, destroyed guest cottages, beachside kiosks and restaurants, and may have swept some surfers out to sea. Most of the area's villagers are fishermen and rice farmers. The tsunami was set off by an earthquake that registered 7.7 in magnitude, according to the United States Geological Survey. The epicenter was beneath the seabed of the Indian Ocean 110 miles south of Pangandaran. The earthquake struck around 3:15 p.m. local time and was felt in Jakarta, the capital, more than 200 miles north of the epicenter. High-rise office buildings swayed, and workers scurried to get out. There were at least two large aftershocks. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, in Hawaii, issued a tsunami bulletin about 15 minutes after the earthquake hit, but Indonesia has not yet installed a warning system on the island of Java, the country's most populous. Australia also issued an alert for western Australia and Christmas Island, but only small swells, less than two feet high, were reported. A local television station, Trans TV, said 40 people had drowned in Kebumen, about 30 miles east of Pangandaran, The Sydney Morning Herald reported Monday evening on its Web site. In Batu Keras, an Indonesian surfer said that two bodies had been found and that he had seen some French tourists who were surfing swept away, the newspaper reported. ''I don't know what happened to them,'' he said. A tsunami is produced when an earthquake thrusts the seabed upward. The resulting waves have little in common with wind-driven surf, which has a very short distance from the crest of one wave to that of the next. An earthquake briefly jolts an entire column of thousands of vertical feet of water from the sea floor to the surface. A result, once the waves reach shore, is more like a sudden rise and fall in the tide than a crashing breaker that quickly washes away. It is unusual for an earthquake with a magnitude below 8.0 to generate a tsunami, said Bruce Jaffe, a United States Geological Survey oceanographer. In this case, the thrust must have been sufficient to jolt the sea, he said. ''It's all related to how much sea-floor displacement there is,'' he said. ''If you have a plastic cup of water and you punch it on the bottom, a bigger punch will create a bigger surge.'' Dr. Jaffe said this tsunami, at first look, appeared quite similar to one that struck the southeastern coast of Java and southwest Bali in 1994, killing 223 people. That wave was generated by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 that shook the seabed about the same distance offshore, he said. Fred Pollitz, an expert on Indonesian earthquake risks at the United States Geological Survey, said that while the earthquake on Monday probably locally dissipated stresses in the submarine fault line that runs offshore parallel to the Indonesian archipelago, coasts to the west on Java and areas of Sumatra probably remained at high risk from big earthquakes and tsunamis."
"Search and rescue teams, using trained dogs to track the scent of decomposing bodies, continued to find victims near this small resort town on Wednesday, as the official death toll from Indonesia's second tsunami in two years reached about 400, with more than 100 injured. A 6.0 magnitude earthquake hit the region on Wednesday, The Associated Press reported, causing tall buildings to sway in Jakarta and sending panicked residents fleeing to the streets. No reports of damage or casualties were available. In West Java, where the tsunami hit Monday, rescue operations were briefly interrupted Wednesday morning when tense residents, who thought they had seen the ocean recede, began shouting that another tsunami was coming, igniting panic among thousands of other residents and rescue workers who were clearing debris along the coast. Roads inland were chaotic as people on motorbikes and in cars, trucks and ambulances raced away from the shore. Terrified villagers and crying children ran toward a large central mosque that was being used as a command center for the relief effort. Military personnel fanned out across the area, urging residents to calm down and slow down. Officials with bullhorns told the crowds that the tsunami warnings had been unfounded. ''We are all nervous,'' said Pak Aditya, 44, who stood outside a mosque directing fleeing residents to safety. ''Nobody wants to take any chances anymore, so if one person screams, everyone runs.'' The tsunami resulted from an undersea quake with a magnitude of 7.7 on Monday, which sent waves of more than six feet, crashing into 110 miles of coastline in West Java. Indonesia pledged Wednesday to speed up construction of a nationwide tsunami alert system, The Associated Press reported. Immediately after the quake on Monday, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and Japan's Meteorological Agency issued warnings of a possible tsunami. It struck Java about an hour later. Kusmayanto Kadiman, the minister of science and technology, said in Jakarta that Indonesia had received the bulletins 45 minutes before the tsunami hit but that officials had not announced them to avoid causing unnecessary alarm, The Associated Press reported him as saying. Questions continued to reverberate on Wednesday, though, about whether adequate warnings had been issued by international and Indonesian offices responsible for tracking earthquakes and tsunami threats. The offshore quake in this case was initially estimated by the United States Geological Survey to have a magnitude of 7.2. Hours later, that figure was raised to 7.7, putting the temblor closer to the 8.0 magnitude that prompts an automatic tsunami warning. The difference between a magnitude of 7.2 and 7.7 is significant to experts, like those at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii, who have to race to determine if an undersea earthquake is a wave maker. The United States Geological Survey said on Wednesday in San Francisco that an inexperienced overnight team failed to review the quake quickly so that it took six hours to provide an accurate 7.7 magnitude, Reuters reported. There were some indications on Wednesday that a more precise early estimate would not have mattered on the ground in Java. Charles McCreery, the director of the United States Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii, which also monitors tsunami threats in the Indian Ocean, said that going to 7.7 from 7.2 would only have expanded the area put under a tsunami watch, but would not have changed the level of warning for Indonesia. It is up to individual countries to decide how to convey the information to the public, Dr. McCreery said. Most of the damage was in this resort and fishing town. The waves, which reached as far as 500 yards inland, destroyed hotels, houses and roads, tossing vehicles around the landscape like toys. Indonesia's coordinating minister for the people's welfare, Aburizal Bakrie, on Wednesday afternoon pledged about $500,000 to people affected by the tsunami, while government trucks began delivering food and tents here. Many villagers remained at camps set up on nearby hilltops, fearing another tsunami. Hundreds were staying in the sturdy central mosque, where bodies of the dead were arriving in trucks to be washed before burial. But the owners of wave-battered hotels, restaurants and cafes began returning, salvaging what they could and searching for friends and relatives. Despite the morning panic, coordination of the relief and rescue effort appeared to be progressing quickly. A United Nations team from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance, along with the World Health Organization and other groups, had arrived by Wednesday. Several international aid organizations were also working in the area. But the majority of the rescue effort has been led by the Indonesian military and disaster response unit, each accustomed to responding to disasters in a country that has earthquakes, mudslides, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. Soldiers in military fatigues unloaded boxes of noodles and bags of rice from trucks arriving Wednesday from Jakarta. Others sat cross-legged, cooking rice and wrapping small packets of food intended for survivors. Tents were erected Wednesday morning, and hot food and water were being distributed at the largest of the refugee camps, where 2,000 villagers had slept in the open air Tuesday night without food or water. Relief groups in Indonesia are stretched thin, working at maximum capacity, after an earthquake in Yogyakarta killed more than 5,000 people and left more than a million homeless on May 27. Hundreds of aid agencies are still helping to coordinate reconstruction in Aceh Province, on the northern tip of Sumatra, where a much larger tsunami in 2004 killed more than 120,000 people and left 500,000 homeless."
"Mount Merapi has long been considered one of Indonesia's most unpredictable volcanoes. Its last major eruption in 1994 caught everyone by surprise when superheated clouds of sulfuric gas killed 66 people in this village on the mountain's high southern slopes. Today, scientists, who have been sleeping in their offices since activity first increased on April 12, have much better equipment to monitor the towering cone of 9,800 feet. Yet Merapi's fickle nature is evident from the graphs marking its activity. In sharp peaks and troughs, red lines rise and fall daily across a period of more than a month. Fears of an eruption increased significantly after a powerful earthquake struck the nearby Yogyakarta area on May 27, killing more than 6,200 and setting off a major rescue effort. The red lines shot off the chart as the earthquake's shockwaves slammed into the side of the mountain, disturbing the magma bubbling inside. Then the activity quickly dwindled. But over the last month, increasingly frequent tremors, lava flows and clouds of gas have suggested a significant eruption is about to occur. Subandriyo, head of the Merapi division for the Volcanology Center in Yogyakarta, who has been watching the mountain now for 10 years, said that given the current activity, it was unlikely Merapi would settle down without some sort of eruption. The lava dome, formed as magma seeps from the crater and cools, is now about four million cubic yards, growing by a few hundred thousand cubic yards a day, he said. ''The bigger the lava dome gets, the more unstable it becomes,'' said Mr. Subandriyo, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. When it collapses, he said, it will send a cascade of volcanic rocks tumbling down the mountain, accompanied by clouds of sulfuric gas, which can reach a temperature of over 550 degrees Fahrenheit. He said the lava dome was still fairly secure, though it was somewhat weakened after the earthquake. Most volcanoes have vertical eruptions, firing lava and debris high into the air. Eruptions at Mount Merapi, however, flow down its sides, affecting only the surrounding areas. Yogyakarta, an ancient city 20 miles south with a population of about a million, was badly damaged in the quake but will almost certainly be spared an eruption, Mr. Subandriyo said. One of Merapi's most serious threats are the hot gases, which escape the mountain's vents several times a day. So far they have reached villages closest to the crater, about two miles away. Once the gas clouds start extending more than three miles, Mr. Subandriyo said, it is time to worry. About 200,000 villagers live within about four miles of the volcano, and more than 30,000 of them live in the most vulnerable areas. A number of relief agencies who came to Yogyakarta more than a month ago to prepare for the eruption quickly diverted their aid to Bantul, the district hardest hit by the quake, more than 40 miles south of Merapi's southern slopes. The possibility of another disaster so soon after the earthquake has many aid agencies on edge. ''It would be a horrendous distraction to have two disasters, one from the north and one from the south,'' said Craig Owen, a spokesman for Oxfam, which was one of the first relief agencies to attend to victims of the earthquake, primarily because it already had a team monitoring Merapi. Villagers living on the mountain's slopes know Merapi's temperamental behavior all too well. They have evacuated and returned home and evacuated again countless times since the volcano first started showing increased activity more than a month ago. Thousands of villagers, mostly men, have long defied government orders to leave and continue to tend to their farms. Many, after numerous scares, have mastered the art of fleeing. Villagers often sleep in groups on the slopes, small fires keeping them warm, with someone keeping watch. Motorbikes and flatbed trucks are kept close by and communities have developed signals, like banging on lamp posts with hammers. Merapi first unleashed in grand form on May 15, when several large clouds of sulfuric gas poured out of its crater, sending villagers running for their lives and blanketing the volcano's southern and western slopes with ash. The local people and scientists prepared for a big eruption, but the lava dome did not collapse. It was stopped short by an unusual volcanic phenomenon, Mr. Subandriyo said. Usually, when the pressure of the gases magma rising inside the volcano's belly is released, they dislodge the lava dome, setting off a full eruption. But the new lava dome that has formed over the last month did so behind the remains of old lava domes, making it more difficult to dislodge. Mbah Marijan, a 79-year-old mystic who lives in Kaliurang, directly below the lava dome, has been appointed by the sultan of Yogyakarta to make annual offerings to the volcano. He receives a constant parade of villagers seeking advice on how to appease Merapi's rollicking spirits, which according to Javanese legend are now having a feast. Late one night last week, Mr. Marijan and a large entourage walked barefoot through villages in the shadow of Merapi's smoldering cauldron. In perfect silence they walked, adorned in ornate Javanese dress, praying for God to protect them. Traditional offerings of rice and other bits of food hang from doorways of the small houses, surrounded by green rice paddies, along Merapi's ascent. Many people here, in a population that is mostly Muslim but also includes those who harbor ancient animist beliefs, said Merapi was angry because its land has been pillaged. Volcanic sand is considered excellent building material and is used in construction throughout central Java. Despite the offerings and prayers by those who live on the mountain, Marijan said, their ultimate fate rests with God. ''I am not a scientist, and I am not psychic,'' he said. ''We can only pray for Merapi not to harm us.'' Correction: June 8, 2006, Thursday Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about the increased activity at the Mount Merapi volcano in Indonesia referred incorrectly in some copies to the distance between the volcano and the city of Yogyakarta, which is far enough away that it is unlikely to be damaged in an eruption. It is 20 miles, not 200."
"In the southern part of this city a short street once alive with guest houses, restaurants, travel agencies and souvenir shops now sits quiet, with barely a soul to be found, just weeks before the onset of the tourist season. The early morning earthquake on May 27 reduced the quaint street, Prawirotaman, to ruins. Throngs of half-awake, panicked tourists who were here that day and managed to survive relatively unharmed crawled out of rubble, wondering what to do and where to go. The 15 guests at Hotel Prambanan, a two-story inn with about 30 rooms in the popular low-budget backpacking district, were all spared serious injury, as were the other visitors staying nearby. ''Blessed be to God that no one was hurt,'' said Jahyanto, 39, the manager of Hotel Prambanan, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. ''They were confused and scared. I just tried to help them find the fastest way out of Yogyakarta.'' Yogyakarta Province is the second most popular tourist destination in Indonesia, Bali being the first. Ancient temples, palaces and a vibrant artists' community draw hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists a year to this area. Tourism accounts for about 20 percent of the province's income and is second only to agriculture as a source of revenue. Handicraft villages in Bantul, the hardest-hit district, supplied 40 percent of the souvenirs sold throughout Indonesia. Three thousand family kilns for pottery were destroyed in the quake, and most of the villages were nearly leveled. On Monday, an official from Indonesia's Social Affairs Ministry announced that the death toll from the quake had been revised to 5,782 from 6,234, saying that some victims had been found alive and that others had been counted twice, The Associated Press reported. Even before the quake, tourism here was threatened by fears of an eruption at Mount Merapi, just north of Yogyakarta. A marketing campaign to show tourists that Yogyakarta, 20 miles south of the volcano, is out of Merapi's reach began several weeks ago and included organized visits to the mountain's slopes. Two days after the program began, and the first tourists arrived at Mount Merapi, the quake struck. Yet tourism officials are optimistic that they can recover. Most of Yogyakarta's major tourist sites were undamaged and remain open, including the city's biggest draw, the Borobudur Buddhist temple, which is more than 1,000 years old and is a Unesco World Heritage site. ''Re-establishing the tourism industry here won't be easy,'' said Wiendu Nuryanti, secretary general of Yogyakarta's International Center for Culture and Tourism. ''But we are working together with a lot of different agencies to help the tourism industry.'' Along with local and national government officials, Ms. Nuryanti has created a task force to help rehabilitate tourism in Yogyakarta. The office of the task force, the Java Crisis Tourism Media Center, is busy with volunteers collecting data on damaged tourist areas. Regular meetings are held to discuss strategies for recovery. Indonesia's minister of culture and tourism, Jero Wacik, has already indicated that the government will provide subsidized loans to ruined businesses, and tax incentives for struggling hotels and tourist agencies. Condroyono, the provincial director of tourism, said strategies were being developed to use the earthquake and volcano as a way of diversifying tourism. Though Javanese culture will always be the primary reason tourists come here, he said, there are plans for tours to areas of geological significance, like massive fissures in the Gudung Kidul district, caused by the quake, or the ash-stained slopes of Mount Merapi. ''There is the potential for a kind of adventure tourism here now,'' he said. Indeed, in the last few weeks a large number of domestic and foreign tourists have brushed aside danger, driving to evacuated areas to take pictures in front of Merapi. Ms. Nuryanti said her task force planned a major campaign for Mount Merapi, trying to capitalize on the recent international news coverage. The volcano is an important symbol in Javanese culture. Its spirits are believed to protect the ancient kingdom of Yogyakarta, and the designs of many of the temples are modeled after the volcano's shape. Mr. Condroyono admitted that it would be a long time before most potential tourists saw Yogyakarta as something other than a disaster area. ''This will take a long time, more than two years probably, before tourism can start growing here again,'' he said. Standing alone among the remains of his former business, Mr. Jahyanto, the hotel manager, said all he needed was a little money to start again. ''Maybe it's a dream,'' he said. ''But it is the dream of everyone on this street to rebuild and reopen our businesses.''"
"Behind a painted sign on a sidewalk reading, ''This is not an exhibition, it's a disaster,'' hundreds of traditional ceramic sculptures lie shattered beneath a collapsed roof. More than half the houses, shops and galleries lining this small street here were destroyed in the earthquake on Saturday and are littered with the broken remains of their owners' livelihoods. The hundreds of artists who live in Kasongan, a village in Bantul, the district hardest hit by the quake, have survived for generations by selling the pottery they make to tourists. The region affected by the earthquake is part of the ancient kingdom of Yogyakarta, the cradle of Javanese art and culture, making it one of the most popular tourist destinations in Indonesia. ''I'm worried I will have nothing to give to my children now,'' said Buang, 50, who uses only one name. He has four adult offspring, all of whom worked in the family's shop. His youngest son, Eno, who will spend Thursday, his 22nd birthday, looking after his injured mother and grandfather, was the only relative to escape the building that was the family's house and shop before it crashed down. In a panic, he followed the faint sounds of his mother's call for help, throwing aside pieces of brick wall. When he finally reached her, her face was bleeding heavily. ''I was scared and confused,'' Mr. Eno said. ''There was so much happening. But all I could think of was reaching my family. My family is my treasure.'' Mr. Eno dug everyone out, including his father, pinned beneath a fallen doorway. His cousin, however, who lived down the street, died instantly, with seven other people from this community of a few hundred people. The Indonesian Social Welfare Ministry said nearly 6,000 people had died in the quake, which also left more than 130,000 homeless. Mr. Eno's family, and five others, are sleeping in a tent. His mother, Gimah, 50, lies on the floor, recovering from a blow to her head. His grandfather, whose back is injured, is carried several times a day by neighbors to a nearby health clinic for observation. Ms. Gimah comes from a long line of ceramic artists. She made most of the family's sculptures, while her children operated the store and her husband of more than 30 years supplied the materials. In minutes on Saturday morning, the quake reduced all the family had worked for to waste. ''We have to start all over, like so many of the families here, from the beginning,'' Ms. Gimah said. Mr. Eno worried that the lack of tourists would prolong their despair. In this region, thousands of shops make and sell handicrafts, traditional batik clothing, musical instruments and ceramic sculptures, many of them exported to the United States and Europe. Performances of ancient Javanese shadow puppetry and gamelan orchestras -- Indonesian musical ensembles with wind, string and percussion instruments -- are frequent in Yogyakarta. Sophisticated galleries, teeming with collectors and contemporary exhibits, line its southern streets. In the aftermath of the earthquake, many of these contemporary artists are mobilizing relief and offering their studios as temporary shelters. Others are trying to salvage mangled paintings from ruined workshops. The Indonesian Art Institute in Yogyakarta, where famous artists regularly lecture and foreign students, many from the United States, come to study Indonesian art, had major structural damage. And 20 of its students died in the quake. Nindityo Adipurnomo, curator of the internationally famous Cemeti Art House in Yogyakarta, has taken into his gallery nearly 20 neighbors whose houses were flattened. During the day, he drives to Bantul to deliver food and other supplies. He said that many studios and galleries were damaged but that artists in the Yogyakarta area were trying to continue their work. ''It is important to keep busy, for artists to keep working and to continue displaying their art, it helps us to cope with what has happened,'' Mr. Adipurnomo said. He has decided to go ahead with an exhibition scheduled for next week in Jakarta. Ki Timbul Hadiprayitno, a 73-year-old master puppeteer who lost his house, most of his puppets and all of his musical instruments, agreed. He is fully booked through August and has not canceled a single show. Shadow puppetry is one of the oldest art forms in Indonesia. Its stories offer a glimpse into the layered philosophies of Javanese spiritualism, which includes elements of Hinduism and Islam. Many of the stories emphasize a philosophy of acceptance, known locally as pasrah. ''We can only just keep going,'' he said. ''Bad luck, good luck, life, death, it is all God's will.'' Mr. Hadiprayitno, who started performing in 1946 and regularly performed privately for Suharto, the former president, lives in Tegal Dowo, a village in Bantul that was almost leveled. He lost three quarters of his finely detailed wooden puppets, some hundreds of years old, which depict everything from old-world kings and queens to monsters and clowns, and his two gamelan orchestras, which consist of several xylophones, hand drums, gongs and flutes. ''It is very hard for me to have lost my puppets,'' he said, sitting under a tarp outside his son's partly collapsed house, drawing on a crackling clove cigarette as minor aftershocks rumbled. But he will find a way, he said, and will not postpone a coming performance in Bantul to celebrate the new harvest. The show is scheduled for Saturday -- one week after the earthquake left his community in ruins."
"Safina Bibi stood amid the ruins of her home, wiping the sweat from her face. ''The way things are in our city, it is very difficult,'' she said. ''They have not even cleared the rubble from the streets.'' More than eight months after Pakistan's worst-ever earthquake killed 73,000 people and left three million homeless, families here still swelter in tents waiting for a government compensation plan to kick in so they can start to rebuild. They are being told to leave their camps and return to their villages. But with no money, not many can reconstruct their homes. ''Officials are trying to close down the camps, but we tell them where else can we go?'' Safina Bibi said. She said she was not sure the government compensation would ever come through. The government, and the army in particular, have been praised by aid officials and even the earthquake victims themselves for their management of the main relief effort immediately after the Oct. 8 quake. Pakistan successfully averted widespread hunger and disease and sheltered tens of thousands who were left homeless just before winter. ''The army did well, there is no doubt,'' said Sardar Sikandar Hayat Khan, the prime minister of Pakistani Kashmir, who worked out of a tent for months until his offices were made safe. A recent report by the United Nations and the Pakistani government also concluded that the relief effort was ''one of the best examples of civil military cooperation in a post-natural-disaster setting.'' Yet if the emergency relief stage is over, reconstruction has barely begun. There was little sign of it on a recent visit to this city, the capital of Pakistani-administered Kashmir, where a few street cleaners were out clearing debris from the earthquake. Families are still living in clusters of tents in parks and open spaces in the suffocating summer heat. They said they were dreading the monsoon rains, which come in July. Since it successfully managed the relief effort, the army has passed the job of reconstruction to the local and federal civilian governments. It is being led by the Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority, under a civilian leader. The reconstruction plan, which was drafted with help from international donor countries, relies on the private sector, and intends to pay cash compensation to families to help them rebuild their homes. The government will pay about $3,000 to every family that lost its home, and about $1,300 to families whose homes were damaged, said Muhammad Waqas Hanif, deputy director of the reconstruction authority. The allotments -- totaling some $2 billion -- should each cover 75 percent of the cost of building a simple 400-square-foot house. Since March, about two-thirds of the 300,000 people who were living in the camps have begun to return home. Yet the summer building period is rapidly slipping away, and many people are still without money. They will not be able to start building before the monsoon comes, when heavy rains are expected to destabilize many of the hillsides even further, wash out roads and make most construction work impossible. Despite the delays, Jan Vandemoortele, head of the United Nations mission in Pakistan, praised the plan for its owner-driven rebuilding through cash compensation. ''We believe it is the right way, but it is not easy,'' he said. ''It needs due process and assessments, some elements of control, so there are unavoidable delays.'' Mr. Vandemoortele noted that government-led rebuilding plans had proved slow and inefficient in several countries dealing with the destruction from the South Asian tsunami that struck in December 2004. The government has made rural homes the priority. Only later, he said, would it focus on the 120,000 urban homes destroyed, the resettlement of 18 villages declared unsafe and the rebuilding of public buildings, hospitals and 8,000 schools. In the meantime there is a stopgap plan to put up 5,000 temporary homes for urban families for the winter. The money being paid out may not be much for middle-class city dwellers, but it should help the poorest and most vulnerable families, who so often fall through the cracks of relief operations, Mr. Vandemoortele said. The money will be paid out in installments as houses are assessed and rebuilding is monitored. Teams of government officials and military engineers have been surveying the 460,000 destroyed rural houses since April and are expected to have the task completed by the end of this month. [In a telephone interview on June 20, Mr. Hanif, the deputy director of the reconstruction authority, said the first cash disbursements had already gone out to 200,000 homeowners.] But for those families stranded in towns and tents, the mood is one of sinking depression. Food aid for people living in the tent camps has been cut and the cash replacement has not come through, families said. On the university grounds, where 50 families camped through the winter, 20 families remain with nowhere to go and no relief in sight. Faiz Muhammad, 57, a jobless laborer and the father of six, lives in one tent. The family was living in a rented space before the earthquake hit and, as a result, will not qualify for compensation, he said. All he was counting on now was a cash payment that should replace the food aid, which he said stopped in March. ''We don't have any plan,'' he said. ''We are sitting here and counting on God.'' For Shahnaz, 35, a mother of four in the next tent, life is even more bleak. Her husband was paralyzed when their house collapsed on him in the earthquake and broke his back. He has since lost his job as a school clerk. In recent weeks, officials declared their village uninhabitable. All its former residents are scattered in tents through the city waiting for the government to decide where to relocate them. ''I am very worried because we don't have enough for our living expenses and I have young daughters to feed,'' she said. ''We are only surviving on money from relatives and what people are giving us.''"
"The government said Tuesday that more than $3 billion would be needed for reconstruction because of the May 27 earthquake, far more than originally estimated. The government plans to present its findings, which were compiled with help from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, on Wednesday at a meeting with the Consultative Group on Indonesia, an organization of Indonesia's major donors. The announcement is likely to put pressure on the international community to raise more money for reconstruction in devastated central Java, where about 5,800 people died in the earthquake. The National Development Planning Agency estimates that 360,000 houses were damaged, half of them completely destroyed, in a 193-square-mile area south of Yogyakarta. Half of the $3 billion will be needed for new houses, said Suprayoga Hadi, who led the agency's assessment. ''We have yet to plan a financing scheme for rehabilitation and reconstruction,'' he said. ''But we will be appealing for more financial help at the donors' meeting.'' The 2006 and 2007 national budgets will also be revised, he added, to help meet reconstruction costs. Aburizal Bakrie, coordinating minister for people's welfare, said last week that his office estimated that as many as 1.5 million people were living in tents or in improvised shelters made from debris. Many of those people, however, are sleeping outside because they remain terrified of aftershocks, though their houses might be safe. Such numbers are troubling to relief workers here who say money is also needed to maintain health standards in the thousands of blue and green tents sprouting up all over Bantul and Klaten, the two hardest-hit districts. ''This is not about the dead, it is about the living,'' said Michael Kocher, regional director of the International Rescue Committee in Indonesia, which has begun distributing hammers, wheelbarrows and other tools to residents. ''The devastation here is absolutely remarkable. But because the casualty level is not like the tsunami, I think it seemed minor in comparison, which sets a dangerous precedent.'' The Indonesian government said it would disburse about $3,000 for each house destroyed in the quake, with payments coordinated by Yogyakarta's provincial government. The United Nations and the government have each said they want to avoid building temporary shelters as they did in Aceh, Indonesia's northernmost province, after the tsunami in 2004. About 80,000 houses are still needed there. Long lines began forming last week in front of informal distribution posts in Bantul, where families received money for food and building supplies. Yogyakarta's governor, Sultan Hamengku Buwono X, said he hoped to complete the distribution of financial aid soon. ''We need to start reconstruction as quickly as possible,'' he said. ''The longer people live in tents, the more problems arise. It's important for people to get back to living their lives.'' Many residents of Yogyakarta, which is a center of Javanese culture, have strong spiritual philosophies that promote independence, community and acceptance -- all of which are said to be helping the relief effort move forward. ''We don't want to depend only on aid,'' said Iwan, 37, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, and whose neighborhood was almost entirely leveled. ''We can depend on each other. With some financial help we are able to rebuild on our own.''"
"A strong earthquake shook the entire island of Taiwan on Tuesday, followed by three powerful aftershocks, but the quake did not produce a tsunami. The local news media said the seismic activity had killed two people and injured as many as 42. The Central Weather Bureau in Taiwan estimated the initial earthquake at 6.7 magnitude, while the United States Geological Survey put it at 7.1. The Japan Meteorological Agency warned Tuesday evening of a three-foot tsunami heading for the northern Philippines, but the agency later withdrew the warning after concluding that no tsunami had occurred. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii said there was no threat of a Pacific-wide tsunami. The earthquake attracted especially wide attention in Asia because it came on the second anniversary of a far more powerful earthquake off Sumatra in Indonesia, estimated at 9.1, that set off a tsunami up to 30 feet high. That tsunami killed more than 200,000 people around the coastline of the Indian Ocean, most of them in Indonesia, and left nearly two million people homeless. The first strong aftershock of Tuesday's earthquake took place eight minutes after the initial earthquake, and was estimated by the Central Weather Bureau at 6.4 magnitude, and by the United States Geological Survey at 7.0."
"Several ships were on their way Thursday to repair regional telecommunications cables broken by an earthquake off southern Taiwan, but officials warned that it could take several more days before Internet access across much of Asia returned to normal. Fixed-line and mobile international telephone connections were largely back on line, two days after the quake, with a magnitude of 6.7, struck the Luzon Strait, telecommunications companies and regulators in several countries said. Property damage was limited, but six of seven undersea cable systems, accounting for 90 percent of telecommunications capacity of the region, broke ''one by one'' in the quake and its aftershocks, the Office of the Telecommunications Authority in Hong Kong said. The cables link countries in North and Southeast Asia to one another and to North America, and the disruption has underscored the vulnerability of the telecommunications infrastructure that the fast-growing region depends on for commercial activity. Banking services, particularly international transactions, were severely hampered Wednesday, but banks across the region reported that services had resumed Thursday after networks were configured to detour around the broken cables. International transactions at automated teller machines continued to be affected in some places, however, and access to international Web sites was spotty. Two cable maintenance ships from Singapore and the Philippines were expected to arrive at the site of the broken cables on Tuesday, and three more were to depart soon, the Hong Kong telecommunications authority said. Once they arrive, it could take five to seven days to carry out repairs. A technician in Singapore said that the speed of the repair work would depend on how quickly the crews found the severed ends of the cables, some of which were broken in several places. While undersea cables are occasionally damaged by ships' anchors or fishing nets, repairing them after an earthquake is likely to be much more complicated, he said. The severed ends may have been buried by landslides or washed far from their positions on the seabed, said the technician. Most telecommunications companies were able to restore international voice calls Thursday by rerouting traffic to satellites and to cables unaffected by the earthquake. The financial impact of the cutoff has been limited by the fact that many executives and traders are still away for the holidays. Markets were quiet and trading light. ''Business has dried up in the past week anyway, so there's not a lot of things people are doing anyway,'' said Joel Kim, a fund manager for ING Investment Management in Hong Kong. Among the damaged cables were the 11,800-mile APCN-2, a $1.1 billion cable built in 2001 that links China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan; and the north Asian loop, a 24,200-mile cable stretching from South Korea around the Eurasian landmass to the Netherlands. C2C, a $2 billion 10,500-mile cable built in 2002 that links China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan to the United States, was also damaged, as were two cables belonging to Flag Telecom, an around-the-world cable project that went public at the height of the dot-com boom and went broke in 2002. Flag, now reorganized under new ownership, said that it had already booked a repair vessel, and that fixing its cables could take up to three weeks. The only major cable in the area that appears to have escaped trouble was the E.A.C., or East Asia Crossing, cable belonging to Asia Netcom, a subsidiary of China Netcom. The 12,100-mile cable connects China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan. After at least a day of cutoffs, traders said that their Bloomberg financial information terminals were sputtering back to life. Bloomberg's rival financial information provider, Reuters, kept most of its systems running. Donald McCulloch, information technology director of Reuters in Singapore, said that was largely because the company houses its information in Singapore, but backs it up to a separate site in Hong Kong. Rob Enderle, president of the Enderle Group, a technology consultancy in San Jose, Calif., noted that the Internet system was global, ''so when a large part of the world goes dark, companies that run on information take a huge hit.'' ''Trading institutions, for example, can lose millions of dollars in a minute, so not being able to access information for hours or days can be catastrophic,'' he said. Although access appears to have been restored across most of the region, Mr. Enderle predicted that the total bill for Asian telecommunications companies could rise into the hundreds of millions of dollars. ''They are now using secondary services that are generally slower and often more expensive,'' Mr. Enderle said, referring to backup cable lines and satellites. ''But they are still having to sell the service for same price as before, so that eats into revenue.'' The troubles this week also highlighted yet another risk. Anil Talwar, vice president of services management in Singapore for DHL, the global logistics company, said that businesses typically think that having two service providers protects them. ''The question is: If both of the links go down, what will you do?''"
"SINCE the Indian Ocean tsunami two years ago today that killed more than 200,000 people, governments, donors and experts have embraced the idea that healthy mangrove forests and coral reefs could reduce the death toll from a giant wave. Former President Bill Clinton, in his role as the United Nations special envoy for tsunami recovery, recently endorsed a program that will allocate $62 million to preserve such natural barriers in 12 Asian and African countries. But the $62 million question is, will these barriers work? Research suggests that the level of protection offered by greenbelts has been exaggerated. And by diverting resources from more effective measures like education campaigns and evacuation plans to well-meaning but misguided reforestation, we may even contribute to a greater loss of life in future tsunamis. There have been few scientific studies about the protective role of coastal vegetation. And while one study did suggest that a shield of mangrove forest managed to reduce tsunami damage in three villages in Tamil Nadu State in India, the forest was not the only difference between these coastal villages and those nearby that suffered major destruction. Indeed, when my colleagues and I re-analyzed the data, we found no relationship between the death toll in each village and the area of forest in front of each one. What actually saved these villages was being further from the coast or built on relatively high land. It was only a coincidence that they also had more forest between themselves and the ocean (of course, the further a village is from the coast, the greater potential area of forest). Indeed, a recent paper in the journal Natural Hazards that surveyed more than 50 sites in affected regions found that coastal vegetation did not reduce tsunami damage, and that damage was actually greater in areas fronted by coral reefs. Similarly, my colleagues and I, working in Aceh, Indonesia, found that neither reefs nor coastal forest reduced the damage caused by the tsunami. The distance the tsunami traveled inland was largely determined by the height of the tsunami and the slope of the land. In other words, where the tsunami was 30 feet high, it flooded all land lower than 30 feet above sea level, whether this reached 200 yards inland, or two miles. Mangrove forests are, to be fair, very effective at dissipating the energy of storm waves, but a tsunami is a very different beast. Tsunamis, produced by earthquakes, have wavelengths of miles, compared to that of a few yards for typical wind-generated waves. The tsunami, for instance, that hit the Acehnese coast was eight miles thick; this wall of water rolled in for nearly an hour. Of course, coastal forests at some point do begin to reduce tsunami damage, but we can't expect them to offer meaningful protection against the sheer amount of energy involved in a tsunami. In 2004, the energy released by the Indian Ocean earthquake is estimated to have been the equivalent of 23,000 Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs: that's nearly three Hiroshimas for every mile of affected coastline. Another significant concern is the enforcement of buffer zones in the name of tsunami protection. Buffer zones, to have any real effect, would need to be many miles wide and thus impossible to institute without prohibitively high social and economic costs. Perhaps it is unsurprising then that local governments have begun to regulate these barriers in a way that is not only insufficient, but grossly unfair: luxury hotels escape enforcement while tens of thousands of impoverished fishing families in India, Sri Lanka and Thailand are prevented, in the name of tsunami protection, from rebuilding their homes in areas that have been designated buffer zones. A more recent tsunami, on July 17, demonstrated the tragic consequences of inadequate planning. More than 18 months after the 2004 catastrophe, the Indonesian government had yet to deploy an early warning system on the island of Java. Tremors from a major earthquake were felt and the tsunami was preceded by a telltale withdrawal of the sea -- yet amazingly, people did not know to seek high ground. Government officials failed to act despite precise warnings, and more than 600 people died. Clearly, education efforts in Indonesia have been inadequate. But we can take heart in the example set by Japan. On Nov. 15, an undersea earthquake with a magnitude of 8.1 set off that nation's tsunami early warning system. Thousands were evacuated. While the resulting tsunami was luckily too small to cause damage, Japan's sophisticated early warning system, intensive education campaigns, annual evacuation drills and loudspeakers for nearly every kilometer of coastline might have saved thousands of lives if the tsunami had been larger. Similarly effective measures in the Indian Ocean have yet to be developed, in part because efforts and resources remain focused on these questionable schemes to build mangrove barriers. Certainly, coastal vegetation can provide communities with many valuable resources, and the rehabilitation of these ecosystems should be encouraged. But if the aim is to protect people from tsunamis, the science indicates that money would better be spent on early warning systems, education and evacuation planning.

"Telecommunications across Asia were disrupted on Wednesday after an earthquake off Taiwan damaged undersea cables, jamming Internet services as voice and data traffic vied for space on smaller cables and slower satellite links. The quake disrupted services in Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan, but a ripple effect was felt in other parts of the world. Many phone subscribers could not get through to Europe, regional telecommunications operators reported, as they raced to reroute their traffic to alternative lanes. ''We are seeing really massive outages in a spread of countries in East and Southeast Asia,'' said Todd Underwood, chief operations and security officer at the Internet monitoring firm Renesys. ''This is a much broader effect than you see in most natural disasters.'' Financial companies and businesses in the region were hit hard, as online banking and communications between financial markets and traders were affected. The stock exchanges in Tokyo and Hong Kong said they were working without problems, and traders found ways to complete their transactions. The earthquake, which Taiwan authorities said registered a magnitude of 6.7, struck off the island's southern tip Tuesday evening. Several major cables were cut, according to telecommunications executives, including the Asia Pacific Cable Network, which links North and Southeast Asia, and the SEA-ME-WE-2 link, which stretches from South Korea around the Eurasian land mass to the Netherlands. Chunghwa Telecom, Taiwan's largest phone company, said that the quake had damaged two undersea cables off the Taiwan coast. The lines route calls and process Internet traffic for several Asian countries. China Telecom, China's biggest fixed-line telephone operator, said that the earthquake had affected lines ''from the Chinese mainland to places including the Taiwan area, the United States and Europe, and many have been cut.'' It also reported serious damage to Internet connections. PCCW, Hong Kong's main fixed-line telecommunications provider, said that several of its partly owned submarine cables had been damaged. With its data capacity reduced by half, PCCW cautioned that some Internet users in the region could experience congestion over the next several days. Both Singapore Telecommunications, Southeast Asia's top phone company, and its local rival, StarHub, reported slow access to Internet pages. Mr. Underwood said that after the earthquake struck, 3,000 Asian networks disappeared entirely from his company's tracking equipment. By comparison, 5,000 networks disappeared during the blackout of 2003 in the Northeast United States, he said. Networks in the United States and Europe were not affected. However, many companies with subsidiaries, partners or manufacturers in Asia are finding their communications disrupted. ''The reality is the Internet is a global network, and it is fairly rare to find large organizations that don't do a significant amount of traffic to Asia,'' Mr. Underwood said. Experts in Taiwan and elsewhere said that repairs to undersea cables could take weeks, raising fears of more communications difficulties in Taiwan, the fifth-largest economy in Asia, and of more telephone and Internet problems in the region. ''This is a major event, and it's not going to get fixed fast,'' Mr. Underwood said. ''These cables are underwater. You have to get boats in place, they have to drag the cables until they find the break. The good news is that during earthquakes the breaks tend to happen close to land and are not really that deep. But the last underwater cable outage took six weeks to fix.'' Analysts said it was fortunate that the breakdown occurred during the relatively quiet holiday period, with business activity light and markets mostly quiet. Such an interruption during an ordinary week could have had catastrophic impact on regional businesses, especially financial markets. Still, many securities traders in Hong Kong and Singapore were unable to obtain prices and complete orders because networks linking financial companies were disrupted. Dealers in the region said they have had difficulties accessing international news providers for information. They also reported that customers using the Internet for prices complained that they could not look up stock prices online. That Internet traffic out of Southeast Asia was not cut off entirely was testimony to the progress made in recent years in adding capacity along new routes, executives said. But they said that most information sought by global Internet users remains in the United States, and Asia is linked to that information by only a handful of relatively fragile cables that are subject to forces on the ocean floor. Information can be transmitted by satellite, but it is slower and more expensive than sending it over cables. ''We do need these submarine cables,'' said Paul Budde, an analyst in Sydney. ''Satellite is not really an alternative for the heavy traffic. For the bulk, you do need these fat cables.'' But most of Asia is separated by water, meaning data must be carried by undersea cables that rest on the seabed up to eight kilometers, or five miles, below the surface. Building such submarine cables is an expensive undertaking. By one estimate, it costs up to $500,000 a kilometer to lay undersea cables. As a result, most cables are owned by consortiums of telecommunications companies, which create joint pricing and share the cost of building and repairing the cables. As recently as a decade ago, Asia was connected to the United States by only five cables, all through Japan. The dot-com boom ushered in a period of rapid expansion, and cables now connect Australia, China and South Korea directly to the United States. In an attempt to add even more capacity to meet growing demand in Asia, Verizon Communications announced last week that it was joining with three Chinese carriers, a Taiwanese carrier and a South Korean carrier to build the Trans-Pacific Express, a $500 million, 18,000-kilometer network in the region. That will help telecommunications companies in the future, but their most immediate task is finding alternatives for delivering their customers' information until the undersea cables can be repaired. KDDI, Japan's major carrier for international calls, whose communications along undersea cables out of Japan went through Taiwan before reaching Southeast Asia and beyond, said that the use of alternative lines would limit the possibility of a complete breakdown in communications. In Seoul, the KT Corporation, South Korea's leading fixed-line and broadband service provider, rerouted ordinary telephone calls and data traffic, said Yeom Woo Jong, a KT spokesman. ''This incident reminds telecommunications companies like us of the importance of acquiring alternative lines,'' Mr. Yeom said, ''to ensure undisrupted services during an emergency. It means investment and more cost.'' INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS"
"It was a natural disaster for the digital age that radiated through much of Asia and beyond after an undersea earthquake late Tuesday off the coast of Taiwan. People awoke Wednesday to find themselves without e-mail or the Internet and, in some cases, without telephone connections, cut off from the rest of the world. The earthquake ruptured undersea cables that are part of a communications fabric that circles the globe. Coming on the second anniversary of the Asian tsunami that killed 230,000 people, it was a reminder of the world's increasing dependence on communications technology. Financial companies and technology services suffered most directly. Operations from travel agencies to newspapers to schools struggled to maintain their routines. ''You don't realize until you miss it how much you rely heavily on technology,'' said Andrew Clarke, a sales trader in Hong Kong. ''Stuff you took for granted has been taken away and you realize, 'Ah, back to the old way, using mobiles.' '' In this time of rapid change, it is easy to forget how quickly innovations have become necessities, including cellphones, the Internet, e-mail and instant messaging on both the computer and telephone. ''I'm completely dependent on the Internet,'' said Robert Halliday, an American writer based in Bangkok. ''If the Internet goes down for half a day, people can just stay in bed in terms of getting any work done.'' On Wednesday, he was frustrated in trying to get information for a review he was writing of a Romanian DVD. It takes a moment to realize what a task that would have been just a few years ago. The words ''instant'' seems to have lost some of its edge. It has become the norm, and anything else seems agonizingly slow. The word ''global'' has shrunk to the size of a computer screen. When Mr. Halliday's mother, who is in her 80s, wants to reach him, she taps an instant message into her telephone from the United States. ''All of a sudden,'' he said, ''there's a message on the phone, 'Oh, you should be here, the azaleas are out.' '' Without e-mail, Ken Streutker, a Dutch-Canadian actor and producer in Thailand, had no way to arrange a meeting with a friend who was arriving at the airport in Bangkok. ''Now I'll have to stand there at the airport with the traditional handwritten sign and hope that someone notices,'' he said. Many enterprises found themselves paralyzed without the Internet. In Beijing, Wang Yifei, an independent television producer, sent instant telephone messages when her Internet connection was down. ''I had a horrible day,'' she said. ''I've been complaining about this all day. This high-tech world of ours. It didn't happen in the old days. In the end I can't do anything.'' In Manila, Abe Olandres, who owns and runs a Web-hosting company, just about gave up. He said he planned to try a Wi-Fi hot spot in a coffee shop after struggling at the office all day. ''This is killing me,'' he said. For his customers, it may have been worse. When their service went down, they tried to reach his help desk, but it was down, too. Niall Phelan, the creative director of APV, a media production company in Hong Kong, said he usually received about 300 e-mail messages a day. On Wednesday, he said, he got none. Without e-mail, he was back to the old-fashioned way of communicating, by telephone, which greatly multiplied his work. ''Usually, one e-mail is cc'd to lots of people,'' he said. ''But, with calling, you have to contact all six involved people individually.'' With their work day disrupted, he said, ''Most people I spoke to in Hong Kong today are just twiddling their thumbs.'' He made the best of it. ''What I did today was eight hours of filing,'' he joked. ''I had a year's worth of paperwork. If the Internet is still down tomorrow, maybe I will finish it.'' Even without the help of technology, work seems to have its own momentum. Lucy Fennell, regional business development director at APV, stayed late in the office despite the enforced slowdown. ''What I did do today was, well,'' she laughed, ''I've filled in my diary for all of next year, you know, with friends' birthdays and things. I guess you have to do that.'' Carolyn Mison-Smith, director of a language center in Singapore, found in the communications crash a concrete demonstration of the interconnectedness of the world. ''Cables all over the seabed,'' she said. ''I don't know if your average dude appreciates that fact. ''Who puts them there and how long does it take and how many kilometers is it?'' she said. ''If they've got cords going all over the seabed, I think that's fascinating. Who designs it all, who's the engineer that designs it and who are the laborers who go down and do that?''"
"British and Pakistani investigators are trying to determine whether the group of Britons suspected of plotting to blow up as many as 10 commercial airliners may have received money raised for earthquake relief by a Pakistani charity that is a front for an Islamic militant group. The charity, Jamaat ud Dawa, which is active in the mosques of Britain's largest cities, played a significant role in carrying out relief efforts after last October's earthquake in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. It is one of the most militant of the groups battling the part of Kashmir controlled by India. In May, it was labeled a terrorist organization by the United States government. British and Pakistani investigators are looking into the possibility that the group, whose name means the Association of the Call to Righteousness, passed the earthquake donations raised in British mosques to the plotters, according to two people familiar with the investigation. One former Pakistani official close to the intelligence officials there said Jamaat ud Dawa provided the money that was to be used to buy plane tickets for the suspects to conduct a practice run as well as the attacks themselves. The money is believed to have come directly from the group's network in Britain and was not sent from Pakistan, the former official said. ''The Pakistanis have been asked by the British to examine the links between Jamaat ud Dawa and the suspects in the airplane attack,'' the former Pakistani official said. According to a former British security official familiar with the investigation, some of the money raised in British mosques also went to the group's militant activities in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Both the former Pakistani official and the former British official spoke only on the condition of anonymity. On Wednesday, Pakistani officials detained Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, the head of the organization. On Sunday, a senior American law enforcement official said that the British police and intelligence officials had identified several suspected accomplices of the plotters who were believed to have provided support to the plot outside Britain. The new suspects were identified by checking the arrested men's computers, the official said. After the earthquake, which killed some 73,000 people, Jamaat ud Dawa raised funds in British Pakistani areas in London, Birmingham and Manchester. The group also urged British people of Pakistani origin to go to the region to help in the relief efforts, and hundreds did. Several of the 23 suspects still in custody after the arrests by British police on Thursday -- most of them Britons of Pakistani descent -- traveled to Pakistan last year, ostensibly to help with earthquake relief efforts, said Nasir Ahmed, a leader among Britain's Pakistanis and a member of the House of Lords. Mr. Ahmed said he was not sure how many of the suspects rounded up last week had gone to Kashmir to help, but among those who had gone were the suspects arrested in High Wycombe, west of London. The former Pakistani official said several of the suspects had gone to Pakistan at the time of the earthquake. The official declined to say whether the suspects were believed to have been organizers or people who had provided support, like passports and safe houses. Mr. Ahmed said it was possible that those who went came into contact with the militant Islamic organizations that were doing the relief work on the Pakistani-controlled side of Kashmir, where most of the casualties were. Indeed, at the time, Jamaat ud Dawa was welcomed by people in the area for stepping in where the Pakistani government had failed. The group was praised as one of the few providing aid efficiently, while Muslims around the world complained that Pakistanis had been abandoned. ''In the first few days, it was only religious organizations, the militant organizations, that were prepared to dig out people and provide relief supplies,'' Mr. Ahmed said. ''It is possible that young people, many people, who have gone from U.K., may have fallen into hands of organizations like Jamaat Ud Dawa.'' As both a militant group and a social welfare organization, Jamaat ud Dawa resembles its brethren in other parts of the Muslim world, like Hamas in the Palestinian territories and Hezbollah in Lebanon. In the days after the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States government shut down many Muslim charities that it said were financing militant activities. No one from Jamaat ud Dawa could be located Sunday in Britain. Its Web site says the organization has provided food to some 54,000 families who were struck by the earthquake. It also claims to be ''one of the most feared militant groups fighting in Kashmir.'' The Web site displays a photograph of Mr. Saeed leading a demonstration protesting the United States government's designation of his group as a terrorist organization. The details of the suspected plot to blow up the airliners began to emerge Thursday, when the police in Britain detained 24 people. The authorities said the suspects, most of them British-born young men of Pakistani descent, intended to smuggle liquid-based explosives onto 9 or 10 commercial airliners headed for the United States and detonate them as they approached. British officials said the plot, had it been successful, could have killed thousands. The day before, on Wednesday, the police in Pakistan had arrested a British-born man they said was linked to Al Qaeda. They say they have at least one other British man in custody and are looking for at least one other suspect. American and Pakistani officials have long believed that Jamaat ud Dawa is the successor organization to Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was banned in 2002 by the Pakistani government, under American pressure, after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. It has called for holy war against the United States, India and Israel. Although it has avoided direct association with Al Qaeda, links between the groups have often surfaced. Abu Zubaida, the senior Qaeda member captured by Pakistani forces in the city Faisalabad in 2002, was found hiding in a safe house for Lashkar-e-Taiba. THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE MONEY TRAIL"
"The giant earthquake that set off a devastating tsunami across the Indian Ocean in December 2004 disrupted the earth enough to change gravity and to deflect satellites passing hundreds of miles above. Two identical satellites, collectively known as the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or Grace, travel one behind the other in a polar orbit separated by about 130 miles. By recording small changes in the distance between them when their orbits are deflected, the satellites provide data used to calculate variations in the earth's gravitational field. In a report in the current issue of the journal Science, scientists at Ohio State University and the University of California, Santa Barbara, report that in the aftermath of the magnitude 9.1 earthquake, the largest in four decades, Grace recorded a sudden drop in gravity near the quake's epicenter off Sumatra. The rupture raised thousands of square miles of the seafloor, reducing the density of rocks in the earth's crust and diluting their gravitational pull. The data, combined with models of the earth's interior, indicate that the density changes extend hundreds of miles. ''It really gives an insight of the earth's interior down to the mantle area,'' said Shin-Chan Han, an Ohio State research scientist and an author of the Science paper. It was the first time that the gravitational effect of an earthquake had been observed. The gravity at the earth's surface decreased by as much as about 0.0000015 percent, meaning that a 150-pound person would experience a weight loss of about one-25,000th of an ounce. In other places, where the force of the earthquake compressed rocks, gravity increased by a similar amount. The force of gravity is changing in other areas of the earth, too. In Hudson Bay, Canada, which was crushed downward by the weight of ice during the last ice age, the ground is still rebounding upward. That change adds about one-400,000th of an ounce to the weight of a 150-pound person every year. KENNETH CHANG FINDINGS Correction: August 10, 2006, Thursday An article in Science Times on Tuesday about changes in Earth's gravity referred incorrectly to gravity changes associated with the December 2004 earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It was the first time such gravitational changes were observed from space, not the first time they were ever observed. Such changes were detected in earlier earthquakes by ground-based gravity instruments."
"The musicians who come to play at One World Theater, a 300-seat performance space in Austin, Tex., often say there's something different about the place. The way sound reverberates off the curved back wall. The fact that it always seems cool and quiet, removed from the traffic and broiling Texas sun outside. But what the performers never seem to suspect, says the theater's co-owner, Julian Goldstein, is that the place is built out of old coffee cups and packing peanuts. Or to be more precise, it is made of Rastra, a composite of recycled polystyrene, cement and concrete that, thanks to the growing attraction of green living, has become one of the hottest building materials in the United States. More than 6,000 structures -- ranging from a traditional three-bedroom house in the Poconos to a four-story block of loft apartments in Portland, Ore. -- have been built in the United States using Rastra, the vast majority of those in the past five years. (Rastra was created by a group of European engineers in 1972, but it has taken a long time to catch on here.) The material is popular among the environmentally conscious for two reasons. All the polystyrene foam used in its production is recycled. And because foam accounts for 85 percent of its volume, Rastra is a remarkable insulator, greatly reducing energy costs. The stuff is also practically indestructible. It is fireproof, resistant to high winds and in laboratory tests has withstood a simulated earthquake of 8.5 on the Richter scale. Termites can't eat it, nor can mold grow on it. ''Katrina and all these brush fires have been great advertising for us,'' says Karl Holik, the president of the Rastra Corporation. A standard Rastra block is 10 feet long, 10 inches thick and 15 inches high. These porous, pumicelike blocks are stacked, either horizontally or vertically, and held in place with urethane glue or metal staples. Steel rebar and poured concrete are then inserted into the form at 15-inch intervals. Despite its blocky beginnings, Rastra can be formed into almost any shape using simple tools, so making rounded walls, niches, pop-outs and circular windows is much easier than with wood framing or cinder block. Rastra has a few downsides: it can be about 10 percent more expensive to build with than wood, although proponents say it more than covers the price difference within a decade through savings on energy bills and insect-proofing. And while it's far lighter than pure concrete, a standard Rastra block still weighs 150 pounds, which can make it expensive to ship. But perhaps the biggest concern with Rastra is obtaining it at all: the material has become so popular that the company -- with just one North American plant, in Pima, Ariz. -- can't keep up with demand. Deliveries can take up to 12 weeks. (The company hopes to open two more plants, in New Mexico and Ohio, by next summer.) Still, to many who care about green building, the minor inconvenience is worth it. As Goldstein, of One World Theater, says, ''There's an intrinsic value in a building that is also helping the planet.'' Jeremy Kahn Going Green"
"YOKOHAMA BURNING The Deadly 1923 Earthquake and Fire That Helped Forge the Path to World War II. By Joshua Hammer. Illustrated. 313 pp. Free Press. $26. On Sept. 1, 1923, a massive earthquake ripped through the Japanese port city of Yokohama and leveled much of Tokyo. The subsequent fires, tsunamis and aftershocks claimed the lives of 140,000 Japanese and foreigners. Millions were left homeless. Even though it was one of the greatest natural disasters in history, however, memories of it have been overshadowed in Japan by the firebombing of Tokyo and other cities during World War II, not to mention the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In ''Yokohama Burning,'' Joshua Hammer excavates this terrible event from oblivion. Hammer, a former correspondent for Newsweek and the author of ''A Season in Bethlehem: Unholy War in a Sacred Place,'' has pored over diaries, letters and documents and conducted numerous interviews. His zeal to produce a kind of cinéma vérité of the earthquake, in the form of anecdotes and short accounts, can become dizzying in places. He also tries to make too much out of minor American government officials or other characters whose obscurity is not a historical accident that needs to be remedied. But Hammer goes beyond simply recounting the earthquake's aftermath to make a provocative and largely persuasive case that it marked a turning point in Japan's embrace of militant nationalism. Had the earthquake never occurred, the story of Yokohama would be fascinating enough. After Commodore Matthew Perry opened up shogun Japan with gunboat diplomacy in 1853, the sleepy fishing village of Yokohama became a foreign settlement, epitomizing the determination of Emperor Meiji, a Japanese version of Peter the Great, to import and emulate Western ideas. Countries like the United States and Britain set up consulates, while a motley crew of foreigners, including Chinese money-changers, English silk merchants, Spanish missionaries and Lebanese jewelers, piled into Yokohama around the turn of the century. Soon enough, it came to resemble Shanghai. Japanese nationalists, however, were incensed by the emergence of the bustling cosmopolitan city. As Hammer notes, the divisions between traditionalists and modernizers extended even to earthquakes. The traditionalists clung to the notion that angry spirits were responsible for natural disasters, and resisted Western science. Hammer highlights the travails of Akitsune Imamura, a University of Tokyo seismologist who represented a new generation of scientists, trained by Western experts. Imamura, who predicted the timing and magnitude of the Yokohama quake 16 years in advance, came close to ruining his career. Government officials and academics dismissed him as an alarmist, and tried to force him to recant. Once the earthquake erupted, the Japanese government was nowhere to be found. Americans and Britons on the scene carried out the lion's share of the initial rescue work. Hammer shows that the emergence of modern communications, most importantly the telegraph, meant that the Yokohama disaster became the first modern international relief effort. But the Japanese authorities, intent on demonstrating that they didn't require assistance, reportedly jammed the messages of American relief ships and tried to prevent them from docking. Nor were Japanese captains inclined to take on refugees stranded on beaches. According to Hammer, ''historians looking back for clues to Japan's psychology prior to World War II might begin here, in this key moment of interaction between the Japanese and their American would-be rescuers, when Japan's peculiar pre-conflict combination of pride and insecurity was on full display.'' Indeed, in what Hammer sees as a dress rehearsal for World War II, the Japanese military seized upon the chaos to foment hatred of Koreans living in Japan. Thousands were murdered by street thugs. As Hammer observes, ''although the killings appeared to have started spontaneously . . . the army in Tokyo and other areas whipped up rumors about Korean well poisonings and arson, and for several days gave vigilante squads known as Self-Defense Committees freedom to patrol the streets and exact what justice they saw fit.'' Given the virulence of Japanese nationalism, which today remains a potent cultural force that suppresses any effort to confront past war crimes, the militarist cabal would most likely have come to power even if the earthquake had not taken place. But it certainly harmed relations between the United States and Japan. Resentment over reports that the Japanese had failed to show much appreciation for American aid ended up heightening xenophobia on both sides of the Pacific. In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge, over the impassioned and prescient warnings of his ambassador to Japan, opportunistically signed the egregious Immigration Act, or National Origins Act, which in essence stigmatized the Japanese as an inferior race. The result was to infuriate Japan and bolster the power of the nationalists. As the United States and Japan headed toward war, the lone survivor of their brief détente seemed to be the venerable Imperial Hotel, which had been designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and opened its doors on the very day of the earthquake. The large courtyard pool Wright insisted upon permitted the Imperial's alert staff to douse numerous small blazes created by the earthquake and to save it. The hotel went on to survive World War II as well. Its reputed indestructibility added to its mystique, attracting celebrities like Babe Ruth and the honeymooning Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio. In the late 1960's, old age led to the dismantling of the hotel, whose facade can now be viewed in a theme park devoted to the Meiji era. In illuminating this descent into militarism, Hammer's fine book helps to ensure that Japan cannot dispose of the other, less savory parts of its past as tidily. Jacob Heilbrunn, a frequent contributor to the Book Review, is writing a book on neoconservatism."
"Two powerful inland earthquakes rattled the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Tuesday, leveling hundreds of buildings and killing at least 70 people, according to government officials in Jakarta. The death toll was expected to increase as rescue workers continued to dig through the rubble. There also were reports of hospitals being overwhelmed with the injured, and relief agencies and the government trying to provide temporary shelter. ''My house is on the brink of collapse,'' said Imelda Kusmawati, 28, one of thousands sleeping in tents or under the stars instead of returning indoors after the quake. ''I am still traumatized and worried about aftershocks,'' she told The Associated Press. Communication was cut off from much of the area close to the epicenter so there was no immediate way of knowing the extent of the damage there, officials said. The first earthquake, with a magnitude of 6.3, struck just before 11 a.m. 20 miles beneath the town of Solok on Sumatra's western coast. It was followed two hours later by a magnitude 6.1 quake with an epicenter a little to the east, according to the United States Geological Survey. Smaller aftershocks continued throughout the day, residents said, stirring the fear left by the tsunami that struck in December 2004, taking 170,000 lives in northern Sumatra. Mass panic followed the strong quakes on Tuesday, snarling traffic as people fled buildings and neighborhoods for higher ground. Several large volcanoes in western Sumatra also showed increased activity after the tremors. Rumblings were felt several hundred miles away in Singapore and in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, prompting the evacuation of several office towers in those cities. However, no damage was reported outside western Sumatra. Officials in Solok, the hardest hit area, said hundreds of houses and several large buildings had collapsed. Among them, according to local news reports, were a number of large mosques and schools. Several children were killed when a school building collapsed onto a playground. Before sunset, Revanche JesRizal, who works for a local nongovernmental agency that helps residents prepare for potential disasters, said tents were being set up for evacuated residents and for others too afraid of the aftershocks to return home. ''Aid is on the way, but progress is being delayed by damaged roadways,'' he said. The initial panic, he said, was calmed by radio announcements from the local government that there was no threat of a tsunami. The mayor of Solok, Syamsu Rahim, told Reuters: ''Our priority is to handle the injured ones, including their families. We have set up six tents at a soccer field as emergency posts.'' The injured were also being taken to hospitals in nearby Padang, although damaged infrastructure was forcing ambulances off the major roads. Deaths were reported in cities throughout western Sumatra. More than 300,000 people live in the Solok area. The police said that more equipment was needed to dig through rubble and more ambulances were needed to transport victims. John Budd, a United Nations official in Jakarta, said a team was on its way to Solok to assess the destruction."
"Rescue teams on Wednesday continued searching collapsed buildings in western Sumatra for victims of two large earthquakes that struck Tuesday. The quakes left at least 52 dead, said Cabinet Secretary Sudi Silalahi, lowering the death toll by nearly 20, The Associated Press reported. He said some victims had been counted twice. Earlier in the day, the governor of West Sumatra Province, Gamawan Fauzi, said the death toll was about 70, with several hundred other people seriously injured. Officials in Solok, the hardest-hit area, said, however, that the number of dead might change because some families had reported the same death repeatedly. More than 1,000 buildings collapsed and thousands of others had structural damage, officials said. In Solok, 44 schools were damaged, 15 of which were destroyed. Four public administration buildings also were heavily damaged. Displaced and fearful residents remained in large communal tents on Wednesday, while cold rain fell intermittently. The first quake, with a magnitude of 6.3, struck just before 11 a.m. about 20 miles beneath Solok. The second, of 6.1 magnitude, struck two hours later a little to the east. United Nations officials arrived Wednesday to assess the damage and reported that sanitation and shelter would be needed for displaced residents. John Budd, a United Nations official in Jakarta, said that temporary schools and school materials would be needed for the 1,500 children whose schools had been affected. Local private aid agencies, the military and the police were still finding injured residents late Wednesday and taking them to hospitals nearby in Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province. Local relief organizations said that aid was moving quickly and that the rescue effort appeared to be focused and under control. Pressure on hospitals in Solok eased slightly on Wednesday as patients with minor injuries returned home and the military moved debris blocking roads to Padang. ''Fewer people have been arriving at local hospitals,'' said Willy Micaksono, an official with a local private group that has been helping to dig victims out of rubble in Solok since Tuesday afternoon. ''But there are many houses damaged here, no electricity and it's been raining. Many people are still crowding refugee camps.'' The United Nations was moving tents, water, family hygiene kits and other aid to the region on Wednesday. The Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, was scheduled to travel to the region on Wednesday but delayed his visit because of two other disasters -- a passenger jet that caught fire on landing at Yogyakarta, on Java, and mudslides caused by heavy rain on Flores, a small eastern island where dozens of people were killed. The Indonesian archipelago is in the middle of the Pacific Ring of Fire, where seismic activity is common. In the last several years, the country has been hit by a seemingly endless string of natural disasters. A large quake measuring 6.3 struck near Yogyakarta on May 27, 2006, killing more than 5,000 people, leaving hundreds of thousands homeless and setting off a volcanic eruption. A 9.1 magnitude offshore earthquake near Aceh Province in North Sumatra in December 2004 resulted in a tsunami that killed about 170,000 people."
"A powerful undersea earthquake struck early Monday morning off the Solomon Islands, sending a tsunami crashing hundreds of yards onshore and setting off tsunami warnings around the South Pacific. Several people were killed in the Solomon Islands, dozens of buildings collapsed and at least one coastal village was destroyed, according to early news reports from the area. But fears of a major tsunami around the Pacific Rim, like the devastating tsunami of Dec. 26, 2004, appeared to be unfounded. Tsunami alerts were issued in Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and as far north as Hawaii but were later withdrawn. Beaches were closed and ferry services were suspended until the danger had passed in threatened coastal areas of Australia. The earthquake, measured at about 8.0 by the United States Geological Survey in Hawaii, struck at 7:40 A.M. local time (6:40 P.M. Sunday Eastern time) . The survey placed the epicenter 6.2 miles under the ocean and 25 miles from the coastline. Within minutes, residents reported, a wave several yards high flooded villages along the west coast of the Solomon Islands. Reports of death and damage were sketchy in the first hours after the earthquake. The Associated Press cited a man reached by telephone at the police station in Gizo, just 25 miles from the epicenter, as saying that up to eight people had died, including six children. The news agency said the line was cut before the man gave his name. Sky News, a British news service, cited Julian Mcleod of the National Disaster Management Office in the Solomon Islands capital, Honiara, as saying only three deaths had been reported. Reached by telephone, Jacob Pitisoba, 30, owner of Phoebe's Guesthouse in Gizo, the closest town to the epicenter, said two fatalities had been reported there -- an infant who drowned when the wave hit his house and a woman who was killed when a building collapsed. ''The ground moved very strongly,'' he said. ''It was so big, so strong. It was lucky for all of us in Gizo because we were awake and weren't in our beds.'' ''It was supposed to be high tide, so when we saw the sea going out we ran up to the high ground,'' he said. ''All the buildings on the coast are gone, washed away by the tsunami. There's nothing left.'' Harry Wickham, a hotel worker in Gizo, told New Zealand Television that a torrent of water 10 feet high poured through the town, smashing buildings along the waterfront. The earthquake was caused by a sudden slippage where the Australian and Pacific tectonic plates crash together near the Solomon islands, the National Earthquake information Center of United States Geological Survey reported. ''It's not surprising for it to generate a tsunami,'' said Rafael Abreu, a geologist at the center. The center said on its Web site that the original earthquake was followed by severe aftershocks with magnitudes of 6.7 and 6.4 within an hour and a half. Mid-ocean earthquakes of a magnitude 8.0 can generate tsunamis that cause catastrophic damage close to the epicenter, and the shallow depth made it more likely that the quake lifted the ocean floor to create the wave. But generally a tsunami from an earthquake of that magnitude is not powerful enough to inflict damage thousands of miles away. In the case of the Solomon Islands earthquake, the sea floor was shallower to the north and deeper to the south. ''Our simulation model indicates to us the beam of energy of the tsunami was going to be directed to the south,'' said Victor Sardina, a geophysicist at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii. That spared the islands to the north and the waves' energy had largely dissipated before reaching Australia and New Zealand."
"To get a sens0e of the problems in West Oakland, a rough-and-tumble corner of a city known for having a few, you need look no farther than places like 14th Street, where a house floats in midair. One of dozens of Victorian-style houses that dot the neighborhood, the house sits on six makeshift wooden pilings. It has broken windows, peeling paint and a front yard strewn with garbage. A sign announces, ''House Moving,'' but the inhabitants are nowhere to be seen. It has been nearly two decades since the Loma Prieta earthquake caused the collapse of a freeway here, killing 41 people and drawing the spotlight to a long-neglected neighborhood. Now another freeway collapse, precipitated last month by a gasoline tanker explosion, has exposed how desperate things remain. ''It's not like an atom bomb; its more like a neutron bomb,'' said Brian Beveridge, co-chairman of the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project, which monitors conditions in the neighborhood. ''The people are gone, but the buildings are still there.'' An angry and sometimes profane Web site, BeautifulWestOakland.com, tracks the neighborhood's various maladies, with photographs of unseemly images like used syringes, graffiti and unclean streets. Recently, photos of diverted traffic from the damaged freeway were added to its list of annoyances as something that has destroyed ''what quality of life we have been able to piece together.'' If there was a silver lining to the Loma Prieta quake in 1989, it was the decision to rebuild the Cypress Freeway in a more industrialized area to the west. That freeway had long been blamed for dividing the neighborhood and choking its air. In 2005, a small park opened at the point of the Cypress Freeway collapse, its memorial plaque emblazoned with this hopeful slogan -- ''With the collapse of the freeway, a neighborhood divided was reunited'' -- and the freeway's former path was converted to a manicured boulevard, lined with high grass and flowers. But for large swaths of the neighborhood, that is by and large all that has bloomed. Drugs, unemployment and poverty remain pervasive in much of West Oakland, longtime residents and community advocates say. Killings and violence are too common occurrences, they say, and health problems -- mental and physical -- remain a part of the landscape. ''People who had problems still have problems,'' Mr. Beveridge said. Last month, after the gasoline tanker set off a fire that disabled a pair of Interstates here, Margaret Gordon went down to the detour route, West Grand Avenue, to check the progress of the traffic being diverted through her neighborhood. It was not a happy experience. ''My throat got scratchy almost immediately,'' said Ms. Gordon, a longtime resident who serves with Mr. Beveridge on the environmental indicators group. ''And I had my inhaler out before I got home.'' One of the principal concerns is asthma. Health officials say that nearly two out of every five Oakland adults suffer from it, as well as one out of every five children, a situation that some fear may worsen with the influx of cars detouring around the current collapse. The April accident, which took place in a nearby jumble of roadways known as the MacArthur Maze near the Bay Bridge to San Francisco, has sent tens of thousands more vehicles down West Grand Avenue each day. That additional traffic comes on top of thousands of trucks that already travel through West Oakland, heading to the nearby port. Dr. Washington Burns, a retired pathologist who is the executive director of the Prescott-Joseph Center, a community center in West Oakland, said the exhaust from trucks and idling boats in the port had worsened longstanding problems in poor households. ''Ten thousand diesel trucks a day go through the port,'' said Dr. Burns, who is also the director of West Oakland Asthma Coalition. ''Then there's the shipping, also diesel. There's a lot of smoking, a lot of mold and a lot of pests in the households. All these factors contribute.'' The entrenched poverty and occasional flashes of violence have also contributed to many people's malaise, Dr. Burns said, even in the elementary school across the same street from his center. ''We went over there and found that there were three kids who were suicidal,'' he said. ''In one case, the kid's brother was killed, and he was scared for his life. It's that sort of thing that worries me.'' All of which is frustrating for those who remember West Oakland's heyday. Queen E. Thurston, 75, has lived in West Oakland since 1942, part of several generations of African-Americans who gravitated to the area to fill good jobs available in the ports or along the railroads. Ms. Thurston recalls a different place, one where Count Basie played in local nightclubs and where streets were safer and more vibrant. ''When I was growing up, you could skate on the street,'' said Ms. Thurston, who raised six children in the neighborhood. ''You can't do that now because the attitude of the drivers. They'll run you down.'' Also populating the streets, Ms. Thurston said, are drug dealers who are periodically arrested or chased off by police crackdowns. ''But they are still there,'' Ms. Thurston said. ''In the night, we can hear them in their cars, playing their radios.'' The relationship between the Oakland police and residents of West Oakland has also been uneasy for a long time, highlighted in 2000, when four officers assigned to the neighborhood's late-night shift were indicted on corruption charges, accused of assaulting and falsely arresting suspects, and sometimes planting drugs on them. The four officers, known as the Riders, were later acquitted, but the city paid nearly $11 million in a civil suit and the police department agreed to institute reforms. Mayor Ron V. Dellums, a former congressman who took office in January, grew up in West Oakland, has toured his old neighborhood and has promised to attack joblessness, lack of heath care, and crime, including a soaring rate for murders, some of them in West Oakland. Still, for all the problems, there are signs of progress throughout the neighborhood, especially in the eastern parts, which lie nearer downtown. There, several stretches of elegant houses are near renovated low-income housing tracts, and children play in a pair of handsome parks. The area to the east, known as the Bottoms, is less picturesque, but also has pockets of life, including Esther's Orbit Room, a famed nightclub that is one of the last vestiges of the area's entertainment past. Residents are also dealing with what many view as the pernicious influence of gentrification in a neighborhood whose train station is only one stop, or about seven minutes, from downtown San Francisco. New market-rate housing is being built along the westernmost stretches of the neighborhood, and some residents complain that opportunistic developers have pushed out longtime residents. ''Since 2000, there's definitely been a surge of investment in the community,'' said Adam Gold, the administrative director of Just Cause, a nonprofit housing organization based in Oakland. ''But that investment has caused a new set of problems.'' The neighborhood, Mr. Gold said, ''is finally getting attention, but it's not necessarily the attention it needs.'' Correction: May 22, 2007, Tuesday A map on Friday of the site of two freeway collapses in Oakland, Calif., incorrectly located the site of the 1989 collapse of Interstate 880. The highway was about 3,500 feet east of Maritime Street, not at its present location, about 2,000 feet east of Maritime."
"A powerful earthquake jolted central Iran on Tuesday morning, killing at least 420 people and injuring more than 900, the governor of Kerman Province said on state television. The death toll is expected to rise, because many of the injured were reported to be in critical condition and rescue workers have been unable to reach five villages deep in the mountains. The Iranian Student News Agency said 546 people had been killed. The governor, Muhammad Ali Karimi, said several villages in the area, which has a population of about 30,000 people in 40 villages, had been flattened, while others had sustained damage ranging from 20 percent destruction to 90 percent. The quake, with a magnitude of 6.4, was centered on Zarand, a town 35 miles northwest of the city of Kerman. It hit at 5:55 a.m., when many were still asleep, and lasted for 11 seconds. Afterward, many residents insisted on staying outdoors as 20 aftershocks jolted the area. The villages of Dahuniyeh and Hoodkan were destroyed. ''The situation in these two villages is so bad that it is possible no one would be found alive from under rubbles,'' said Iradj Sharifi, a doctor at the hospital in Kerman, the provincial capital. ''The number of the dead might reach 1,000, including the death toll in these two villages,'' the news agency quoted him as saying. A mosque in Dahuniyeh collapsed, burying worshipers who had gathered for dawn prayers, Muhammad Javad Fadaee, deputy governor of Kerman Province, told the state television. Only the blue dome of the mosque could be seen, one witness said. It is not known how many people died there. Images on Iranian television showed piles of mud-brick houses that had easily collapsed. Residents desperately dug through the debris looking for survivors. People carried the bodies of their loved ones for burial, wrapped in bloodied blankets and bedsheets. Survivors sat outdoors in heavy rain on blankets distributed by aid workers. The government-run news media reported that the authorities were distributing tents and blankets and that by afternoon 15 trucks loaded with food and water had begun to arrive. ''All hospitals in Zarand are filled to their full capacity with the injured,'' an announcer on state television said. ''Hospitals in the region cannot receive any more of the casualties.'' Mr. Fadaee said that because of heavy rain and snow, the authorities were moving residents who had lost their homes out of some villages. ''We have distributed tents and blankets but will have to move people of some areas to the city of Zarand before the nightfall,'' he said. Governor Karimi said in a telephone interview from Zarand that rescue workers had reached most of the affected villages but that stormy weather and avalanches set off by the earthquake had cut access to five villages in the mountains. In Zarand, the roof of the bazaar, which dated from the late 19th century, collapsed, the Iranian Student News Agency reported. Cracks appeared on the roof of the grand bazaar in Kerman, the agency said. The earthquake also knocked out electricity in the city. A 6.6 magnitude quake hit the historic city of Bam in December 2003, in the same province. The city was flattened, and 26,000 people were killed. Iran is situated on seismic fault lines, and the mud-brick construction of houses in villages and small towns contributes to the high number of deaths. Mr. Karimi said the experience in Bam had helped the authorities manage the crisis in Zarand more efficiently. ''We created rescue networks and have finished the transfer of the injured by air to hospitals in Kerman and Zarand,'' he said. A search and rescue team with sniffer dogs was on its way from Germany, but he said there was no need for foreign aid. The authorities turned down offers by Turkey and Pakistan to provide help. ''I told foreign teams who are still in Bam and volunteered to come to Zarand to remain there,'' Mr. Karimi said. ''Our task is to distribute food and tents now.''"
"Rescue efforts continued Wednesday in central Iran with dogs and heavy machinery, but there was little hope that many more earthquake survivors would be found under the heavy mud-brick debris dampened by overnight rain. Reports of the number of dead were conflicting, but Iran's interior minister said the toll would probably reach 500. ''The scale of destruction is vast,'' said the minister, Abdolvahed Moussavi Lari, who visited the area Wednesday morning. ''Around 8,000 houses have been destroyed.'' ''Fifty villages are badly damaged, four or five of which are 100 percent destroyed,'' he said. The ISNA news agency said its estimate, based on the figures released by hospitals and local morgues, indicated that 790 had died, but that could not be confirmed. The 6.4 magnitude quake struck northwestern Kerman Province early on Tuesday and lasted 11 seconds. Rescuers found two women alive in Hoodkan, one of several mountain villages that had been cut off until Wednesday because of bad weather and blocked roads. One of the survivors, Zahra Mirzai, 18, emerged to find that the rest of her family had died in the quake. Here in Dahuiyeh, every building except for a small shrine with a golden dome and two minarets was destroyed. A landslide set off by the quake, and fragile mud-brick houses that collapsed easily, left very few survivors. The only buildings that resisted the earthquake were in a 30-year-old housing complex with buildings of concrete and steel nearly three miles south of the village. Huge cracks appeared in the walls, and residents did not dare spend the night inside. But no one was killed. ''Only the poor people who lived in the village have died,'' said Abbass Arabpour, a cleric in Dahuiyeh, who came to help bury the dead. ''Those who could afford to live in the stronger buildings have survived.'' Abbass Mirzai said he had raced here from his home in nearby Zarand to find the bodies of 12 relatives together near the door of his parents' house. ''I think they were trying to get out of the house before the roof came down and buried them,'' he said. The only survivors were his elderly parents who had been out tending their sheep when the quake struck. Mahdieh Arabpour sobbed as a nephew found her sister's wedding ring in a plastic green box under the rubble. ''I don't know how many of my family members have died,'' Ms. Arabpour said. ''All of them I guess. ''My parents, my sisters and brothers with their children.'' Her nephew, Alireza Arabpour, who lived in the housing complex that withstood the quake, said he and his father had rushed to the village to his grandparents' house to help. ''We could hear my uncle's voice screaming for help, but by the time we dug the ground with our bare hands and pulled him up, he was dead,'' Mr. Arabpour said. Dahuiyeh remained without power and water on Wednesday. Trucks were distributing relief supplies, and helicopters flew over the area dropping aid for mountain villages. Some residents complained that many families had not received tents, but the government said it was vigorously trying to distribute enough shelter and blankets before nightfall on Wednesday. The Iranian Red Crescent called for donations of new clothes, blankets and canned food. Bahram Akasheh, a seismologist at Tehran University, said the last earthquake in this region was in 1978, and killed 500 people. ''We warned about earthquakes and said buildings should be strengthened,'' he said, according Iran, a daily newspaper. ''Earthquakes are not necessarily deadly. We are suffering from our own incapability to build stronger houses.'' The supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also blamed poor construction for the extent of the crisis, and in a meeting with engineers and scientists on Wednesday called on the authorities to construct stronger buildings. An earthquake with a similar magnitude hit Bam, a historic city in southeast Kerman Province, in December 2003, killing at least 26,000 people. Specialists said the epicenter of the Bam earthquake was six miles underground, while the quake on Tuesday, in the northwest of the province, was 26 miles deep -- one reason the death toll is likely to be much lower. In addition, Bam was more heavily populated than the villages hit Tuesday. The government, which declared Wednesday a national day of mourning, continued to resist foreign aid. Mr. Lari, the interior minister, said Wednesday that Iran ''cannot prevent foreigners from helping us, but a bitter taste lingers from Bam.'' ''We were promised a lot of things at that time, and a lot of speculations were raised,'' he said. ''Unfortunately, a big part of the aid never arrived.'' The Japanese government announced Wednesday that it would send blankets, tents and other aid worth $191,400, The Associated Press reported. Despite hostile relations between Iran and the United States, President Bush expressed ''sincere condolences'' over the earthquake. ''Our thoughts and prayers are with those families and individuals who lost loved ones,'' the White House said Wednesday in a statement. ''We will be in contact with the government of Iran to offer concrete help.''"
"In the category of ''good research takes time,'' scientists have just discovered more than 100 quakes that occurred on the Moon three decades ago. Seemingly combining archaeology and modern computer science, several groups of researchers have exhumed data from the Apollo landings and taken a closer look at them to improve their understanding of what the Moon is made of and why its inside trembles. ''It's a very exciting data set,'' said Dr. Yosio Nakamura, a geophysicist at the University of Texas who was among the scientists who analyzed the seismographs in the 1970's and continues to work on them today. The lunar landers for Apollo 11 through 16 carried seismometers, the same type of instruments that measure earthquakes on Earth, designed to be left behind and to continue to radio back data after the astronauts left. Apollo 11 left a prototype that failed after a month, and Apollo 13, which was almost lost when its oxygen tank exploded, never made it to the lunar surface. But the four other seismometers, from Apollo 12, 14, 15 and 16, recorded some 12,500 seismic events through 1977, when NASA turned the network off. As expected, the Moon shuddered when hit by small meteors. There were a handful of deliberate tremors when discarded parts of the Apollo spacecraft were sent crashing onto the lunar surface. The seismometers also recorded 28 shallow ''moonquakes'' over eight years, the largest about magnitude 5.0. But more unexpected and still not well understood were numerous tiny moonquakes, several a day on average, that occurred far below, 500 to 750 miles down, about halfway to the Moon's center. ''That's deeper than any earthquake we see on the Earth,'' said Dr. Catherine L. Johnson, a geophysicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. ''It tells you something about the ability of the middle of the Moon to fracture.'' Nearly identical squiggles emerged from the Moon seismographs over and over, indicating that certain parts of the Moon's interior broke repeatedly in the same way, almost like someone cracking his knuckles. Dr. Nakamura and other scientists counted 108 of these regions, which they called nests. The rate of moonquakes seemed to ebb and flow on every 27 days, the time it takes the Moon to circle the Earth, suggesting that they were caused by the pull of tidal forces. Almost all of the deep moonquakes originated on the near side of the Moon, the side that always faces the Earth. That meant either the structure of the far side is different and does not experience moonquakes or moonquakes do occur, but the waves dissipate when they hit a still molten core. That was the unsatisfying, unresolved conclusion to Dr. Nakamura's initial studies 20 years ago. He also could not figure out the sources for more than 9,000 of 12,500 events in the seismographs at that time. The difficulty then lay in the limits of early computers. The four seismometers on the Moon were advanced for their era, recording the data digitally and radioing the information to Earth in real time. But mainframe computers were incapable of processing that much data. Instead, Dr. Nakamura and his colleagues took the computer-friendly digital data and printed them on old-fashioned rolls of paper, then placed the paper on light tables and identified moonquakes by eye. ''We still have those pieces of paper,'' he said. Now he has reanalyzed the 9,000 unidentified events using computers. In a paper published last month in The Journal of Geophysical Research, Dr. Nakamura reported that 5,885 of them turned out to be deep moonquakes and that he had located about 250 new nests. Only a few of the nests were located on the far side, leaving the question about the core and far side earthquakes still unanswered. Meanwhile, Dr. Johnson and a graduate student, Renee C. Bulow, also sifted through the original digital seismic data, looking for the signatures of small moonquakes buried in the noise that may have escaped the attention of scientists looking at the paper printouts. The largest of the moonquake nests in Dr. Nakamura's catalog had 323 events. In their analysis of that nest, Dr. Johnson and Ms. Bulow discovered an additional 101 moonquakes. Dr. Johnson estimated that when the entire analysis was complete, perhaps 1,500 new moonquakes would be added. The findings were reported at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in December. Another researcher, Dr. Amir Khan, a geophysicist at the University of Copenhagen, has also used modern analysis techniques on the moonquakes to conclude that the Moon's crust is about 25 miles thick, 25 percent thinner than earlier believed. Based on the speed of the seismic waves, Dr. Khan concluded that the Moon's interior was considerably different from the Earth's upper mantle, with higher concentrations of aluminum and silicon and lower amounts of magnesium and iron. That would fit current ideas that the Moon did not form at the same time as Earth. If that had been the case, the two bodies would be expected to have similar chemical make-up. But even with computers wringing new answers from old data, the best hope for learning more about the Moon would be a new network of seismometers, especially on the far side."
"Eleven days ago, a team of earthquake experts published a scientific paper precisely describing how the titanic tsunami-generating earthquake off Sumatra on Dec. 26 greatly raised risks of a fresh offshore earthquake. The earthquake they described was almost exactly like the one that struck yesterday. The paper's authors and other experts had calculated how the December shock increased stress on the adjacent section of the Sunda Trench, a seam in the earth's crust where one plate dives beneath another. The pressure greatly increased the chance that the seam would fail, they said. The new earthquake was generated when the plates suddenly moved, releasing pent-up energy. Yet for hour after hour yesterday, no scientist could say with any certainty whether the new quake, a giant of magnitude 8.7 on a fault known to set off killer waves in the past, had in fact spawned destructive tsunamis like those that swept the Indian Ocean on Dec. 26. A tsunami is generated when the ocean floor moves up or down during the quake. Particularly puzzling to ocean and quake experts was that there were clear signs that a tsunami radiated southwest from the epicenter, far from the crowded coasts of the Bay of Bengal that were struck so hard in December. For waves to propagate in that direction and not toward the Indonesian coast was highly unlikely, many experts said. Dr. Bruce Jaffe, a United States Geological Survey oceanographer who is in charge of a federal project aimed at clarifying tsunami threats, said he and colleagues had been in touch with Sri Lankan and Maldivian officials who had evacuated some communities as a precaution. Like other experts, he expressed concern about silence from Sumatra, where the earthquake hit in the middle of the night. Dr. Jaffe said a tsunami that swept parts of Java in 1994 struck the same way. ''Initially it was just reported as a big earthquake, but then the death toll kept rising and rising and rising,'' he said. This time, he said, ''we're all hoping that the lack of reports is because there wasn't a large tsunami, rather than the opposite.'' The difficulty of predicting tsunami hazards from earthquake signs underscored how much remains to be done to create a truly effective warning system for tsunamis in the heavily populated but poorly studied region, experts said. As a result, three months after the December tsunamis exacted a huge death toll, and three weeks after tsunami experts and government officials met in Paris under the auspices of the United Nations to design an Indian Ocean alert system, scientists expressed frustration yesterday with the vast gaps that must be plugged. Dr. Costas Synolakis, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Southern California who attended the Paris meeting, said governments and scientific agencies appeared too focused on expanding networks of seismometers, sensitive gauges that detect ground motion. Knowing how the earth has moved is only the first step to determine if a wave has been spawned, he said. Tide gauges, another priority in the new international tsunami-warning plan, also only give a narrow local view, he added, saying the most valuable tools are deep-ocean instruments called tsunameters that sense a passing wave and transmit an alert via buoys at the surface. ''What we really need is direct tsunami detection,'' Dr. Synolakis said. In the Pacific, the United States has already deployed half a dozen such devices and plans on expanding the network to 32. They provide a clear, direct signal that a high-energy wave is passing, he and other experts said. It would take years before such an array of sensors and buoys could be deployed in the Indian Ocean, where funds and expertise are extremely limited. Until then, countries there will most likely have to rely on indirect measures, several tsunami experts said yesterday. The limits of the system were evident yesterday. Two hours and 20 minutes after the earthquake, Australian officials said a tide gauge on Cocos Island, 650 miles south of Sumatra, registered passing tsunami waves 10 inches high. That is a significant height for a spot in the middle of the ocean, where a wave's energy is spread from the surface to the seabed, making it nearly imperceptible from above. But data about that reading, the one clear signal that a tsunami had been generated, had still not circulated beyond Australian government agencies and a few other offices eight hours after the tremors. Seismologists and oceanographers refused to express a sense of relief about the lack of tsunami reports from Sumatra well into last night. Dr. Kerry Sieh, a Caltech seismologist who has spent more than a decade deciphering past patterns of quakes and waves etched in Sumatran reefs, said it would be nearly impossible not to have an earthquake on that fault line, of that magnitude, without swamping nearby shores. ''I'm biting my fingernails,'' he said last night."
"Just three months after a deadly tsunami punched through the Indian Ocean, a powerful underwater earthquake struck again late Monday off the west coast of Indonesia, sending a ripple of panic and public warnings across a still traumatized region. The quake, which was measured at a magnitude of 8.7, hit shortly after 11 p.m. about 200 miles farther south along the same fault as the more powerful Dec. 26 earthquake and tsunami that killed as many as 270,000 people in 12 Indian Ocean countries, including more than 100,000 in Indonesia. Early signs seemed to indicate that this time the quake had not inflicted anywhere near the same damage. The one glaring exception was the Indonesian island of Nias, where 1,000 to 2,000 people were feared dead, Indonesia's vice president, Jusuf Kalla, said in an interview on Al Shinta radio. But reports from remote affected areas were slow in coming, and scientists and other officials were reluctant to dismiss the possibility of wider devastation, including what might come from new tsunamis. Most clear was that this latest jolt spread fear, that gigantic waves would again inundate many of the same South and Southeast Asian countries still struggling to recover from the disaster of December. The tremor struck about 125 miles off the Indonesian island of Sumatra, home to Aceh Province, among the hardest hit areas in December. It sent jittery residents fleeing from their homes -- relief tents in many cases --into the night and away from the ocean or toward higher ground. In Banda Aceh, the provincial capital, Diah Zahara, 24, said in a telephone interview that the tremors were so strong that they immediately engendered fears of another tsunami. ''Suddenly the road was full of cars,'' she said. ''People were running out onto the street toward safe places.'' Ms. Zahara said she and her mother, Ummi, her father, Gazali, and her 21-year-old brother, Mafoud, all ran from their house and then made their way toward an area away from the sea. ''We just ran, there was panic, and we just wanted to keep going,'' she said. Alessandra Cilas Boas, the communications manager for Oxfam in Banda Aceh, said by telephone that the tremors were so severe that parked cars ''were moving backward and forward'' on the street. ''It was hard to walk,'' she said, as she and her colleagues rushed out of their compound. The tremors lasted for about two minutes, she said. The power went out for some time, adding to the anxiety. In one relief camp in Banda Aceh, an Associated Press photographer reported seeing people fleeing their tents in panic, only to be urged by police to return to their shelters. Reuters quoted Agus Mendrofa, deputy mayor of Gunungsitoli, the main town on the Indonesian island of Nias, as saying buildings had been flattened and townspeople trapped inside. ''Gunungsitoli is now like a dead town,'' he told Reuters. ''The situation here is in extreme panic.'' [In the Sumatran city of Medan, Erni Ginting, a spokeswoman for the disaster center for Aceh and North Sumatra, said Tuesday that the death toll was 322, Reuters reported. She said all the fatalities were on Nias, 220 of them in Gunungsitoli.] On the Thai resort island of Phuket, Wayne Graham, a Canadian real estate agent who lives 200 yards from the shore, said that as soon as the earthquake hit, there was immediate worry of another tsunami. From his house, Mr. Graham said he could see Thai military boats scouring the sea for any changes signaling a tsunami. ''We were nervous and on standby,'' he said in a telephone interview. In Sri Lanka, state-run radio and television urged people to leave the seaside in favor of higher ground. In India, officials in New Delhi alerted local officials to tell residents of the coastal area to move at least 200 yards from the water. The quake's impact could be felt as far as the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur. Australian meteorologists recorded two waves in the Cocos Islands, some 1,500 miles south of the epicenter; the second of the two waves measured 10 inches. Scientists said it was too early to conclude that the quake had generated no tsunami at all, particularly along the coast of Sumatra. The Pacific Tsunami Warning System, based in Hawaii, pointed out that areas that had not witnessed abnormally large waves within about two hours of the quake had probably been spared a tsunami. Speaking to reporters at the United Nations, Jan Egeland, the emergency relief coordinator, said United Nations agencies in the region had received no reports of tsunamis. Before daylight broke on Tuesday, India, Thailand and Sri Lanka -- all hit badly by the December quake -- withdrew their tsunami warnings. Late Monday night, they had urged people to leave low-lying coastal areas. By early Tuesday, there were no reports of abnormal activity on the ocean. The United States military's Pacific Command, based in Hawaii, said it had received no reports of tsunami damage, said its spokesman, Lt. Col. Bill Bigelow. The quake on Monday pointed once again to the lack of a tsunami early warning system in Asia. ''A little bit stronger earthquake and we could have had a major tsunami in the middle of the night,'' Mr. Egeland said. ''We need that early warning system.'' Such a tsunami early warning system exists in the Pacific, but not yet in the quake-prone Indian Ocean, making it impossible for scientists to plan whether and where evacuations should be ordered. Here in the Indian capital, meteorologists staffing an emergency control room said they could only call for calm and caution along the country's Indian Ocean coast. ''You will not know till it comes,'' said S.K. Swamy, a meteorologist in the control room. ''There is no system of knowing it.'' The United States Geological Service reported that the quake on Monday emerged along the same fault line that caused the December quake, which measured 9.3, the world's biggest in 40 years. The quake, Mr. Egeland said, caught the relief community better prepared than the disaster last December, not least because many operations were already in place and running. ''We started in the morning of the 27th of December with virtually nothing, and it really hurt our early relief effort after the tsunami,'' he told reporters. ''We start tomorrow morning with 1,000 international aid workers, with several thousand local aid workers in Sumatra alone, with a dozen helicopters, with 50 to 100 trucks, with several landing boats which we can use for these islands, and we have very good working relations with the government of Indonesia both the local and regional levels.'' United Nations officials are scheduled to start doing aerial surveys on Tuesday morning to gauge the full magnitude of damage. ''My impression is that the system worked far better this time,'' Mr. Egeland said. In Washington, the State Department spokesman, Adam Ereli, told reporters that the agency immediately began communicating with its embassies and coordinating with relief agencies in the region. ''We're applying what we've learned from the previous earthquake so that we can be prepared to be responsive quickly and in a meaningful way,'' he said. ''So where we are right now is having alerted all our posts, been in contact with all our posts, putting ourselves in battle mode to be in a position where we can act.''"
"PAUL MORIN, who helps earth science researchers and teachers visualize information at the University of Minnesota, remembers being frustrated five years ago with the 3-D technology he was using. ''I was working with a cave at the University of Michigan,'' Mr. Morin said, referring to an elaborate and expensive room-size three-dimensional display system. ''And it was cheaper to fly me to the cave from Minneapolis than it was to build one ourselves.'' What's more, while the system was good for researchers, it wasn't suitable for teaching. ''A cave is really a one-person operation, it's really immersive,'' said Mr. Morin, who is affiliated with the National Center for Earth-surface Dynamics in Minnesota. But students didn't need to feel as if they were someplace else; they needed to be able to visualize basic things like mountain ranges and the interactions of tectonic plates. ''We needed stereoscopic imaging, but we didn't need immersion,'' he said. Mr. Morin voiced his concerns to other visualization specialists, including Jason Leigh at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois, Chicago, who had developed cave systems. The result, after several years of tinkering and tweaking and with support from the National Science Foundation, was the GeoWall, an inexpensive system that uses a PC with an advanced graphics card and digital projectors to present the geophysical world to dozens or even hundreds of students at a time. The success of the GeoWall -- there are now more than 400 of the systems in use at schools, colleges and other institutions, loosely linked through a consortium (geowall.org) -- has spawned next-generation efforts meant more for researchers than for students. These include the GeoWall2, a system that typically uses 15 flat-panel liquid-crystal display screens stitched together, and a desktop system, the Personal GeoWall2, with four L.C.D.'s. While these newer systems can be used for 3-D displays, the more immediate goal is to give geoscientists the resolution they need to study things like maps with remote-sensing data or images of rock cores. A 15-panel GeoWall2 system, for example, has a resolution of about 30 million pixels. ''If you want a lot of resolution, getting the big flat-panel system works well,'' said Dr. Leigh, an associate professor of computer science at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and a director of the visualization lab. The high resolution eliminates the need to constantly zoom in to study detail, as is necessary with a typical single-screen PC. The display also allows someone studying a rock core, for example, to ''drive'' its length to compare the composition at different points. Such comparisons can be a tedious process with the actual core itself. These newer systems are more expensive: a 15-panel setup, with its cluster of computers, costs about $90,000, although that should drop as the price of L.C.D.'s fall. And their 3-D capabilities are limited. ''The holy grail is 3-D without glasses, but at enormous resolution,'' Dr. Leigh said. The systems are not there yet. For teaching, the original GeoWall system is generally preferred. It uses off-the-shelf parts (''Anything that a nerdy kid in his basement uses to shoot aliens,'' Mr. Morin said) and open-source and vendor software for creating 3-D images from data. A PC with a graphics card controls two digital projectors that use polarized light to display slightly offsetting images on a silvered screen. Simple glasses with polarizing filters block one image from each eye, creating the stereoscopic effect. A basic GeoWall, either purchased as a unit or assembled by someone with a basic knowledge of computers, costs less than $10,000. That figure is important, Mr. Morin said. ''It's what a department chair or a dean can sign off on without going through an approval process,'' he said. Stephen J. Reynolds, a geology professor at Arizona State University who uses the GeoWall for as many as 220 students at a time in introductory earth science classes, said he takes his students on a tour of the main features of the planet using a presentation developed by Mr. Morin. ''It's a lot easier for them to learn,'' Dr. Reynolds said. ''We spend a good hour or so just exploring the face of the earth.'' Later he uses the GeoWall to explain more complex subjects like seismicity -- rotating a 3-D plot of earthquake epicenters off Indonesia, for example, so that students can see how one plate slides under another. ''They can see the data we've used to come to some of the models we've developed in geology, like plate tectonics,'' he said. The GeoWall uses such basic technology that it is unlikely to change much. But Mr. Morin, Dr. Leigh and others in the consortium are keeping an eye out for improvements to the more advanced systems. ''We are always trying to find better display technology so we can make higher resolution, more seamless displays,'' Dr. Leigh said. One improvement, he said, would be to eliminate the frame around each L.C.D., which gives a multipanel display a segmented look. But he acknowledged that most geoscientists are much more concerned with improving resolution. When it comes to eliminating the frames, Dr. Leigh said, ''the geoscience community couldn't care less.''"
"The violent thrust of the seabed near Sumatra, Indonesia, that touched off catastrophic tsunamis in December created significant new risks of earthquakes and tsunamis there, seismologists are reporting today. The researchers say that the place at greatest risk from a new earthquake is the devastated city of Banda Aceh and that the tsunami risk lies along Sumatra's heavily populated southern coasts. But they added that any fresh tremors or waves would be unlikely to have anywhere near the destructive power of the December earthquake, the world's second most powerful seismic shock in 100 years. Still, the researchers, from the University of Ulster in Northern Ireland, said the new threat added urgency to efforts to extend the world's only existing tsunami-warning network, in the Pacific, to include the Indian Ocean. They said they could not predict when the next shocks might occur, but noted that in similar geological settings, in Turkey and Japan, big quakes had set off tremors in adjacent faults in a few months or years. The findings are described in the journal Nature. Ross S. Stein, a seismologist with the United States Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., who was not involved in the new study but developed a method the authors used to calculate risks, called the analysis ''important and sobering.'' ''What we need now are networks of seismometers in Sumatra and its offshore islands,'' he said. ''If the rate of small shocks climbs, I would become very worried about the prospects of a successive shock.'' The Ulster researchers pinpointed the risks by mapping patterns of aftershocks and using a computer simulation to determine where the quake had intensified or relaxed stresses on nearby seams in earth's crust. Beneath Banda Aceh, the tectonic shifts in December appear to have loosened two vast rock faces pressing together along 180 miles of the Sumatra Fault, which bisects the island. The change makes it more likely that one side could slip abruptly past the other and cause a destructive horizontal jolt, said Prof. John McCloskey, the lead author of the study. Elsewhere the Sumatra Fault has produced major earthquakes, but the northern section, where the pressures have changed, has not seen a big earthquake in more than 100 years, he said. That means it is probably experiencing pent-up stress. The other quake-prone fault lies in the Sunda Trench, a deep scar in the sea bottom running southeast from the epicenter of the December earthquake, the team said. An earthquake there could generate deadly waves, as previous quakes did at least twice before, in 1833 and 1861. Recent computer simulations recreating the 19th-century upheavals and waves suggest that tsunamis from the Sunda Trench would pose a grave risk to Sumatra's southern shores but would not sweep other South Asian coasts. The most imminent risk, Dr. McCloskey said, is probably in the fault beneath Banda Aceh."
"The girl, just 10, trapped partly underwater for two days, would not talk about what happened to her when the waves hit, but her body spoke for her on Tuesday, shaking uncontrollably. ''I can't take it anymore!'' cried the girl, Nana, who lost both parents and so was being nursed Tuesday in a hospital here by her older sister, Rika, 11. She had contracted tetanus, and doctors forbade her to drink water. But she craved it. ''I can't take it anymore!'' Meulaboh, the city nearest the earthquake's epicenter, is a caldron of suffering that will require years of concentrated help. In the week after the quake and tsunami seemed to swallow this area up, its pain was like Nana's -- silent -- and there were fears that no one had survived, with talk of 40,000 dead in the city alone. Fortunately, that turned out to be an exaggerated fear. The dead in Meulaboh number around 6,000, although the number still grows daily. But in the week that aid workers have been here, they have seen that while more people than expected survived, much of the city did not. One result is that the rebuilding task is on a scale no one had previously imagined. ''It's the effect that is so widespread,'' said Pete Sweetnam, an official with Mercy Corps, one of the first aid groups to set up permanent operations here, only a week ago -- at a time when aid to other regions hit by the tsunami was well established. ''There are so many survivors who have lost everything -- and lost access to everything. The economy has ceased to function. Nobody is fishing. No one is working. Nothing is moving.'' The wave hit and splintered the big things into millions of smaller ones scattered for miles: houses and boats to boards, trees to twigs, families to numbed parents and scared orphans. More than half the 100,000 inhabitants of this region are homeless. Oddly, perhaps, the nearness of the earthquake might actually have saved some lives here, by giving people here an unmistakable warning felt much less in places like Sri Lanka or the Maldives. An army officer, Jailani, 32, who like most people here uses only one name, said that when the earthquake hit, at 7:58 a.m. local time on Dec. 26, some buildings collapsed, and many people ran from their homes. Near his house 50 yards from the beach in Meulaboh, a row of shops came thundering down. ''People went out to look at that,'' he said. ''Then the sea went out. People were trying to gather up the fish. Suddenly I saw that water was coming back -- so I ran to tell my family to run. I started shouting: ''Run, run, run!'' He escaped with his three children, and at least one other family listened to his warning: a tailor, Mukhtar Adam, 52, said his family heard Mr. Jailani's cry and ran off to safety. On Tuesday, Mr. Adam, who was not home at the time, returned to look for anything that the tidal wave might have left behind. There was not so much as a scrap of his house. On the ground, the damage looks different from that in Banda Aceh, more urban and therefore strewn more with concrete rubble, with many of the larger buildings left standing, if badly damaged. This city is on a smaller provincial scale, with more buildings made of wood. So it is less like rubble here than a total splintering of everything that the wave crashed through. The wave also seemed to have traveled farther inland, two or so miles in places. It turned everything in its path -- houses, boats, the main fish market -- into a blanket of small debris. The numbers are not official, but some aid groups say that the wide area covered by the wave may have contributed to an especially large number of children dying here. ''On the west coast, there are no children,'' said Dr. Didier Laureillard, an infectious disease specialist with the aid group Doctors Without Borders, which established surgical wards and mobile medical clinics at the main hospital here. ''They died. They couldn't swim.'' In the main refugee camp in Meulaboh, a civil servant named Ishak, 39, spoke of his own lost children: Zikrillah Cucu Pratama, 6; Fahriananda, 4; and Fatur Rahmansyah, 2. For him, the earthquake served to separate him from his family. He ran out to see the damage from the quake, leaving his children at home with his wife. ''Then suddenly, the tsunami came,'' he said. He could not get back to his house in time. He spent two weeks searching for them in all the refugee camps in the area, and finally gave up five days ago. ''I believe they are all gone,'' he said, as the whites of his eyes turned red. ''I feel empty.'' After the tsunami hit, the remoteness of Meulaboh meant that help came here more slowly than to other places. It is only in the past few days that the streets have been cleared, more or less, of bodies -- and the cleanup here is considered to be a week or so behind in more accessible places like Banda Aceh. But both aid officials and people left homeless here say aid is now largely getting through, with scores of flights from American military helicopters and through aid groups by plane and ship. The road south has reopened, and the first aid has begun to arrive by truck. And while Indonesian officials are discouraging it, some people have begun to rebuild. ''Formerly, my house was at this place,'' said a man named Mustafa, 30, in one neighborhood of Meulaboh all but reduced to sticks. Hammer in hand, he had already framed three windows and three doors, rebuilding the three-family house where he lived for 10 years exactly as it was before, with one major exception: he was building now with what the tidal wave left behind from other people's houses. At the hospital here, where Nana lay comforted by her sister Rika, it was not possible to act so concretely on the future. The girls' parents were dead, along with an 8-year-old sister, and Nana was so traumatized she could not speak of her ordeal: two days trapped partway in the water, before a passerby rescued her and brought her to a neighbor, Meri Herawati. Sitting outside the hospital, Ms. Herawati, 30, who until the tsunami hit had employed Nana at small restaurant she ran, wondered how she would take care of the two girls, another brother who survived, and her own son when her own house was also destroyed. ''I will take care of then, but I am staying in someone else's house,'' she said. The future she saw was not like the life she had before. ''It will never be normal again.'' ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: DAMAGE"
"Like many of the hundreds of thousands of survivors left homeless by the recent tsunami, Mohamed Adan, his wife and their six children confront an unpalatable choice about where to go now. But here in Aceh that decision must be made at the intersection of natural calamity and civil war. The couple has returned several times to the shards of their house, and as they contemplate the landscape of loss, they wonder if they will ever be able to come back. ''Who will rebuild it?'' asked Mr. Adan, 60, of the brick, tin-roofed home he built with his own hands, where his wife tended a garden of lush mango trees and brilliant bougainvillea. They could stay in a neighboring village with one of their grown daughters but are afraid of the added burden on her. Or they could go to one of the 24 resettlement camps that the government has started to build for some of the displaced. But the notion of large numbers of people in close quarters guarded by soldiers raises sour memories -- and some real fear -- in the Aceh region of northwestern Sumatra, where the government has fought an insurgency for nearly 30 years. In various phases of the long-running civil conflict, the government has herded people into relocation camps, often after houses were destroyed by the army. Under the banner of security, the government used the camps to keep separatist rebels from mixing with local populations. Some Indonesian aid agencies say the new camps could end up serving a similar purpose, and local people share the concern. ''I am worried that this is another kind of martial law,'' said Livia Iskander, a psychologist and a member of an Acehnese aid agency, Recovery. ''The relocation camps should not be controlled by the military. They should be given back to the community, so people will not live in constant fear.'' The government has already begun construction of two resettlement camps, which it prefers to call centers, that it will administer with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees. The first two camps, one near the Banda Aceh airport, will consist of 10 barracks-style buildings made of wood and metal sheeting, said the site supervisor, Adi Putra. ''Of course we will have soldiers there,'' said Maj. Gen. Bambang Darmono, the officer in charge of the operation. The United Nations refugee agency says it is not opposed to the army's presence at the camps if it is to provide security and is for the purpose of ''law and order,'' said the deputy representative for the agency in Southeast Asia, Stéphane Jaquemet. But he added, ''If it goes beyond that and its purpose is to control the people, we may have questions.'' United Nations officials say they are also trying to insist on refugees moving voluntarily to the new centers. ''The idea is that there will be no forced relocation,'' said Michael Elmquist, the head of emergency assistance for the United Nations in Indonesia. But for those like Mr. Adan and his family there may be little choice. Mr. Adan said he wanted nothing to do with an official resettlement camp -- in part, he said, because he knew that a camp would be a long way from his daughter Masaran. ''I would like to stay here near my daughter,'' he said. ''This is my soil.'' But Masaran's own resources are depleted. She is already looking after her father's other children. Her house was spared by the tsunami, but her rice field is flooded under dirty saltwater that washed in from the ocean. The field was her only source of support. ''I don't feel comfortable living off my daughter forever, but I don't want to move,'' Mr. Adan said. One of the concerns of the refugee agency is that the large centers could become permanent features in Aceh, leaving families isolated from their home communities and extended family relationships. To try to limit the number of people in the new refugee centers, the United Nations refugee agency says it will assist victims whose houses can be repaired. ''We will start helping people rebuild their damaged houses by providing materials,'' said Mans Nyberg, a spokesman for the agency. To complement the government-built camps, the refugee agency said it had started to distribute 10,000 lightweight tents, made for tropical weather, to provide shelter for 100,000 people. About 200,000 survivors in Aceh are believed to be living with relatives, and while many prefer that arrangement over moving to one of the big centers, they are clearly becoming an increasing financial burden on their host families. Mr. Adan's wife, Rusmini, said that with a little investment she could make a go of it for her family in Angan, the village bordering Kling Meria where she and her husband have temporarily settled. She says she will do everything she can to avoid life in a camp. ''I want to own a becak and sell vegetables at the market where many of my friends are,'' she said referring to the small motorized vehicles that villagers use for transportation. ''There is hope for this, but I have no money right now.'' Officials of the United Nations refugee agency say it is concentrating on housing for now and has not tackled the question of offering small loans to help survivors get back on their feet. In the meantime, frictions are emerging in the small villages like Angan that were left unscathed but now have become makeshift refugee centers and must cope with housing the homeless. Many of the displaced survivors sleep in a small open-sided tin-roofed hut usually used as a public meeting place. A makeshift kitchen has opened on the side of the shelter, and vats of steaming rice are readied at lunchtime. The 370 refugees staying with relatives in Angan are too much of a burden for the families, said the village leader, Surya Darma. Already it is too difficult for to guarantee a steady supply of relief food. Most of the food aid that has flooded into Aceh has gone to the makeshift refugee camps, bypassing families that had taken in their own kin, said Mr. Darma's wife, Yulisma, who is the self-appointed aid coordinator. ''Maybe there is food from the military and the government, but we haven't received it yet,'' she said. Where there is limited food, there is also limited patience. Mr. Adan and his family and the others had better move on, Mr. Darma said, adding, ''They should move as soon as possible -- the faster, the better.'' ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: THE DISPLACED"
"Ten days after the earthquake and tsunami flattened this western edge of Indonesia, relief officials described real progress on Wednesday in turning what started as a limited airlift for isolated regions into a vast truck-based network to supply relief to hundreds of thousands of injured and homeless people. The progress comes after what relief officials agree was a frustrating first week -- plagued by shortages, bottlenecks and damaged infrastructure -- and as the outpouring of international assistance topped $3 billion for the dozen nations hit by waves that killed more than 150,000 people. Australia committed $765 million to Indonesia on Wednesday, and a total of $1 billion over five years, making it the largest donor yet. Germany officially put up some $663 million for the regionwide relief and rebuilding effort, and Britain raised its contribution to $100 million. As Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, on their third day in the region, had their first look at the center of the tsunami's destruction, United States officials doubled their estimate of the number of Americans presumed dead in the disaster to 36, and officials were continuing to pare down queries about the missing. ''In more than 40 years in the military and as a high-level government official, I've been in war, and I've been through a number of hurricanes, tornadoes and other relief operations, but I have never seen anything like this,'' Mr. Powell said after flying low over miles of flattened coastline where tens of thousands died. ''The power of the wave to destroy bridges, to destroy factories, to destroy homes, to destroy crops, to destroy everything in its path is amazing.'' Governor Bush heads home on Thursday, but Mr. Powell will stay to attend a conference in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, of donor nations and the countries affected by the tsunami. He will then fly to Sri Lanka, where more than 30,000 people died. The ''core group'' of countries established by Mr. Powell last week to lead the relief effort will be dissolved at the meeting, leaving the task to the United Nations, a State Department official said Wednesday. The core group -- comprising the United States, Japan, India and Australia -- was ''designed to respond to a short-term need,'' the official said, adding, ''Now that the relief efforts are broader and more long-term, the appropriate place for them to be coordinated is the U.N.'' Even as relief officials were increasingly confident that a corner was being turned, they cautioned that help was often arriving too late for increasing numbers of the injured who were succumbing to horrible infections, and that years of work lay ahead to rebuild communities where serious hurdles remained. The hurdles include insufficient warehouse space to keep the supply lines moving smoothly, an inability for now to deliver protein-rich foods like fish, or even cooking oil, and little progress in improving sanitation leaving the area vulnerable to a major disease outbreak. But despite those obstacles, in Banda Aceh, provincial capital of the hardest-hit region that Mr. Powell toured Wednesday, United Nations officials said the relief drive -- from food to water to medicine to housing -- could reach as many as 800,000 people in the province. Mr. Powell said he and the top Indonesian official in charge of the recovery, Alwi Shihab, had agreed on the need to increase the number of landings by American C-130 transport planes delivering aid. The number of flights had been limited by flight-control operations, said Andrew S. Natsios, administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, but should increase over the next day or so. Usaid has rented 80 trucks to move rice, soybeans, water purification kits and other supplies overland to Banda Aceh, Mr. Natsios said. But the 300-mile trip from the city of Medan takes three days because of damaged roads and the threat of violence in a continuing conflict between Aceh separatists and Indonesian government troops. A firefight two days ago halted the relief trips for eight hours, he said. The Indonesia government and the United Nations have also reached an agreement to construct formal camps for the hundreds of thousands of displaced residents, which should gradually replace the dozens of makeshift and often unsheltered sites where homeless victims have assembled, the officials said. A water-purification plant, provided by Australia, is producing 480,000 liters a day of drinking water that is being sent by truck to homeless camps. As of Wednesday, at least around Aceh Province, truckloads of biscuits, rice, noodles and other supplies were totaling 100 metric tons a day, a relief official said. If all goes as planned, that number should jump to 200 metric tons a day by the end of this week, said Mike Huggins, a spokesman for the United Nations World Food Program. ''By the end of this week, we will have the infrastructure in place to feed 130,000,'' he said. Somewhere between a dozen to two dozen medical clinics are also being set up in the province. Mr. Powell seemed moved by the scale of the destruction he witnessed in Aceh. ''I cannot begin to imagine the horror that went through the families and all of the people who heard this noise coming and then had their lives snuffed out by this wave,'' he said. Governor Bush told the crowd of reporters, ''Our hearts go out to the people, the families that have lost loved ones, to this beautiful area, to our friends from Indonesia.'' Along parts of the coast, the most striking feature from the air is the absence of debris in areas that were densely packed with houses until Dec. 26. When the colossal wave receded, it seems to have pulled whole villages into the sea, leaving only gray-brown mud and a web of foundation lines and road outlines to show what existed before. In other areas, houses were so shattered that their multicolored shards were spread evenly across the plain. Occasionally a more durable structure, often a costlier residence, remained intact, satellite dish still fixed to a tile roof. One white mosque with three domes stood in relative splendor above the muck. On a hillock, around a blue tent, about 20 survivors stood in a tiny relief encampment around boxes of supplies dropped from the air. With the helicopters barely touching down to dump boxes of supplies before lifting off to head for another drop point, only boys and men were able to grab what had been dropped, as anyone weaker had no chance to get close. Near the Banda Aceh airport, which was shut down for much of Tuesday after a supply plane hit a water buffalo, a small-town facility is now jammed with helicopters and fat transport planes. United States Navy sailors, helicoptered in from the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln to help out, mix with Indonesian soldiers, some toting machine guns. In an open-sided tent, where Mr. Powell stopped in briefly, about 20 people who have serious injuries or are very ill lay on stretchers, tended by family members. Officials said the local hospitals were full. Banda Aceh is still very much crippled, with symptoms including a widespread power failure that started Tuesday night and lasted all day Wednesday. But many of the markets -- at least in the half of the city that was not destroyed by the tsunami -- are filled again with food, and street vendors are selling bottled water, cigarettes, fruit and vegetables. Perhaps the greatest challenge remains reaching the towns on the western coast, including Meulaboh, that remain cut off. ''We might find that there are not many people there,'' said Inigo Torres of the international aid group Action Against Hunger, ''as most of the people who lived there may be dead.'' -------------------- Turn Pledges to Cash, Annan Urges JAKARTA, Indonesia, Thursday, Jan. 6 (Agence France-Presse) -- Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations said Thursday that $977 million was immediately needed to cover emergency needs for survivors of the tsunami over the next six months. Speaking at a donor conference here, he said the pledges from governments around the world had already exceeded the money needed for emergency programs. But he urged all nations to quickly turn their pledges into cash and remain committed for the long term. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: AID OPERATION"
"A dozen towns that once thrived near here are gone. Some 10,000 people have been buried, local officials say, and the effort to collect bodies cannot keep up. For seven days, the scale of the natural disaster that swallowed coastlines in southern Asia last Sunday has slowly unfolded, with death tolls doubling almost daily. But Meulaboh, just 90 miles from the earthquake's epicenter, remained almost beyond description since no one could get here and the destruction could be only imagined. On Saturday, the president of Indonesia flew in briefly and the examination finally began. It is a picture of grief and devastation beyond that of any other in the dozen countries hit. Apart from a few sturdy mosques and buildings, there is simply nothing left under the mountains of black mud and debris. The people the president met wept as they spoke. One man, Roosli, 52, sat near the entrance of one of the town's remaining buildings, nursing his naked 2-year-old son Bendi, who was the sole surviving child of eight children in the family. ''When the water came I got out of my house and I ran in panic,'' said Mr. Roosli, a street trader. ''I have zero left. I lost seven children. What do I need? Everything. Help us, please.'' Proffering a red plastic cup, he said a cup of rice was issued to all the homeless each day. After his convoy snaked through streets of crumpled buildings, the Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, admitted that assistance was slow in coming to Meulaboh and other areas in tremendous need, and asked the world for help. In Indonesia alone, at least 100,000 people have died, most here in Aceh Province, the government estimates, making Indonesia the worst sufferer from the quake and tsunamis. ''I appeal to the world community to contribute to the reconstruction of Indonesia that has been hit by disaster and we welcome those contributions as a manifestation of global unity,'' Mr. Yudhoyono said at a news conference in the modest but unscathed military headquarters here. He acknowledged that his government had been slow in organizing and dispatching aid. Bloated bodies remain uncollected in the city of Banda Aceh, and there was no sign of any ability to clear the huge amounts of debris and black mud in this isolated town. ''I know there are problems on the ground, and I know we have had some shortcomings,'' he said. He promised that the government would try to improve. Decomposed bodies still lie amid wet rubble on the streets of Banda Aceh, the provincial capital that is 125 miles away from Meulaboh, at the northern tip of Sumatra island. The lieutenant governor of Aceh Province, Abu Bakar, said Saturday that 10,000 people had been buried so far, but that it would be another month before all the bodies could be cleared away. Here in Meulaboh, the shock of last Sunday was still so strong that the military commander, a Colonel Geerhan, wept as he showed Mr. Yudhoyono a video of the townspeople as they ran from the tidal wave to higher ground. In the video, groups of people were seen walking, then running away from the shore. In one frame a man and his small children grabbed the back door of an ambulance, opened it and clamored inside to get a ride away from the water. One of Colonel Geerhan's soldiers explained Saturday that the ambulance was missing and presumed to have been dragged out to sea. In describing the hours of hell last Sunday, Colonel Geerhan said he was preparing to exercise at about 7:45 a.m. when he felt an earthquake. He said he checked on his men at the military headquarters and then went to help dig people out of collapsed buildings. He said the first wave of water came about 15 minutes later, although others said the first wave of water came later, about half an hour to 45 minutes after the earthquake. ''We used ambulances with sirens to mobilize people to go to higher ground,'' Colonel Geerhan said. ''That's when the second wave came, and I found myself next to a 16-foot-by-6-foot fishing boat that had been swept in by the sea. That's when I felt a little bit afraid.'' Each wave was about 15 minutes apart, he said. Within three hours after the last wave, he said, the military had collected nearly 40 bodies. By Saturday, they had buried 4,000, he said. The first American military helicopters pledged by the Bush administration as a key part of the American aid package arrived at the Banda Aceh airport on Saturday and made some deliveries, said Alwi Shihab, the minister for social services. American pledges of aid have risen sharply this week, in the face of local criticism that Washington had done too little to help. Many Indonesians compare the earthquake disaster to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, but note that the death toll here is far greater. Other nations, including Singapore and Australia to the south, got helicopters and medical assistance into Indonesia earlier than the United States. A combination of shock, reluctance by the government to come to grips with the extent of the calamity, and the nature of the disaster appear to have delayed the efforts to help those devastated by the earthquake. A decision was made Friday that the bodies could not be burned because it would violate the tenets of Islam, Mr. Shihab said. ''We don't want to offend the deeply held beliefs of the Acehenese,'' he said. Instead, religious leaders have said bodies could be buried where they were found rather than being taken to a designated grave, which is the custom for Muslims. The biggest challenge in Meulaboh appeared to be the removal of mountains of rubble and the reconstruction of destroyed homes and shops. But Maj. Gen. Judi Jusuf said Saturday that the military was stymied on how best to go about it. Five Indonesian naval vessels arrived Saturday and were anchored offshore with 600 soldiers and some heavy equipment to begin clearing the mess. But the ships could not unload the equipment because the beaches in town had been washed away, the general said. It would also be difficult to bring heavy earth-moving equipment over land because the only existing road into the town was from the south and was too narrow and mountainous. The road to the north connecting Meulaboh to Banda Aceh had hugged the coast and was totally washed away, he said. Along that coast from Meulaboh, 12 towns were washed away by the waves. On Saturday, as Mr. Yudhoyono flew over in a helicopter, there was no sign of life, not even of debris. The sea had apparently washed over the land with such ferocity and then fallen back with such pull that it swept everything with it. Those few who had survived walked out to Banda Aceh. On Thursday, a correspondent for Netherlands Television, Step Vaessen, said she drove for an hour out of Banda Aceh and met a family who had walked since Sunday. ''They were completely exhausted, they had had nothing to drink,'' she said. ''Others said they had walked for three days.'' In Banda Aceh, morale was low because earthquake tremors frightened survivors, said Azwar Hassan, who works in Jakarta as a community development specialist and came back to his home to find his family. Much of his family was intact, except for two missing cousins. ''Everybody wants to run away,'' he said. ''They are just praying and praying and praying.'' But most disturbing, he said, was the feeling among the survivors of not knowing what to do. ''The military is just looking after the dead bodies,'' he said. Instead, Mr. Hassan said, more should be done for the living. ''It's very hard for people to find help,'' he said. He tried to get his family rice, the favored food here. He was disappointed, he said, that when he found an open store, stockpiles of rice from the military storehouse were being sold for the equivalent of $6 a bag, a huge markup on the usual price. Mr. Shihab, like the president, acknowledged that there were huge problems. ''Government is almost dysfunctional, administration is almost in a void,'' he said of what remains in the province of Aceh. ''Even if there are personnel, they are dispirited. We don't have air transportation to move in replacements. Most people are depressed. People say, 'Where is the army? Where are the police?' They are depressed. They can't be replaced in one or two days.'' ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: THE RELIEF"
"IN seven hours last week, great ocean waves scoured shores from Thailand to Somalia, exacting a terrible price in wealth and human lives. But unimaginable as it may seem, future catastrophes may be far grimmer. Many more such disasters -- from earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, to floods, mudslides and droughts -- are likely to devastate countries already hard hit by poverty and political turmoil. The world has already seen a sharp increase in such ''natural'' disasters -- from about 100 per year in the early 1960's to as many as 500 per year by the early 2000's, said Daniel Sarewitz, a professor of science and society at Arizona State University. But it is not that earthquakes and tsunamis and other such calamities have become stronger or more frequent. What has changed is where people live and how they live there, say many experts who study the physics of such events or the human responses to their aftermath. As new technology allows, or as poverty demands, rich and poor alike have pushed into soggy floodplains or drought-ridden deserts, built on impossibly steep slopes, and created vast, fragile cities along fault lines that tremble with alarming frequency. In that sense, catastrophes are as much the result of human choices as they are of geology or hydrology. Dr. Kerry Sieh, a veteran seismologist at the California Institute of Technology, has spent years studying some of the world's wealthiest and poorest earthquake-prone territory -- not only the sickle-shaped scar of faults off Sumatra's west coast that caused last week's tsunami, but also California's San Andreas fault, which could, with a sudden twitch, submerge the inhabitants of some of the most valuable land on Earth. The difference between the rich and poor countries, Dr. Sieh said, was that the rich ones had improved their building techniques and their political systems to deal with inevitable disasters. In the Pacific Northwest, where offshore faults could generate a tsunami as large as last week's ocean-spanning waves, officials have created ''inundation maps'' to know more precisely what would happen in a flood and prepare accordingly. And in response to the threat of earthquakes, buildings on the West Coast now are designed to sway over shifting foundations, and new highway overpasses are no longer stacked like the jaws of a huge horizontal vise. Istanbul, Tehran, New Delhi and other increasingly dense and shabbily constructed cities, on the other hand, are rubble in waiting. When an earthquake leveled the ancient Iranian city of Bam in 2003, for instance, more than 26,000 people were essentially crushed by their own homes. Several earthquake experts refer to the ''seismic gap'' as a way of describing this difference between the ability of rich cities and poor ones to withstand earthquake damage. ''Tehran is a city the size of Los Angeles, with thrust faults like Los Angeles,'' Dr. Sieh said. ''In Los Angeles the next 7.5 quake might kill 50,000 people. In Tehran, that would kill more than a million people.'' Nonetheless, elected officials and disaster agencies, both public and private, remain focused on responding to catastrophes instead of trying to make societies more resilient in the first place, said Dr. Brian E. Tucker, a geophysicist and the head of GeoHazards International, a private research group trying to reduce poor countries' vulnerability to earthquakes. For instance, while the United Nations in 1989 declared the 1990's the ''International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction,'' and created a secretariat to run it, it set no concrete goals or timetable for accomplishing them, Dr. Tucker said. He described a recent study by Tearfund, a Christian relief agency, that found that less than 10 percent of the money spent on disaster relief by government agencies and institutions like the World Bank goes to preventive measures. According to the study, Mozambique, anticipating major flooding in 2002, asked for $2.7 million to make basic emergency preparations. It received only half that amount from international donor organizations. After the flood, those same organizations ended up committing $550 million in emergency assistance, rehabilitation and reconstruction financing. Dr. Sieh said he was not confident that wealthy countries would ever recognize the value of prevention. Even as they grow more scientifically prescient, people have a blind spot for certain inevitable disasters, either because they play out over long time frames, like global warming, or because they are rare, like tsunamis. ''I really am wondering if, from an evolutionary biological perspective, we're really equipped to deal with things that only recur once every several lifetimes or longer,'' Dr. Sieh said. Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia University's Earth Institute, was more optimistic, if only slightly so. He noted how Bangladesh had seen its mortality rates from flooding drop sharply since the 1970's, mainly by adopting simple means of getting people to higher ground, some as basic as installing high platforms for people to climb above the floodwaters. BUT he also noted another class of cataclysms that which receive no blanket news coverage: malaria, AIDS, crop failures -- even global warming. ''We're at a period in Earth's history where we're living on an edge where things can go terribly wrong if we're not attentive,'' Dr. Sachs said. ''But we also have magnificent knowledge and technologies that could make the outcomes far better than they are now.'' The tsunami assault, he said, could be a call to action. But he and Dr. Sieh agreed that it could also end up just another in a series of distant disasters, a disturbing distraction for the world's more fortunate nations. ''There is a technological and scientific basis for proactive strategies,'' Dr. Sachs said. ''But they are not being applied, and there is no reason for that. It's not even a question of money. It's much cheaper to anticipate rather than respond.'' That is true, he said, whether the goal is restoring fertility to African soil or building a system to warn of tsunamis."
"Aboriginal tribes here on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal largely survived the Dec. 26 tsunami, but it devastated the coastal areas of the archipelago, military and government officials said Tuesday. The islands are home to six small tribes that have maintained ancient ways as hunters and gatherers and that mostly shun outsiders. Their isolation may have provided some protection from the worst ravages of the earthquake, which was less than 100 miles away. Although a survey is still under way, A.L. Singh, a research officer with the tribal welfare department who accompanied a team to track down the Onges, who number about 94 on Little Andaman Island, said most were safe in forested highlands. Lt. Gen. B.S. Thakur, the Army's commander in chief at Port Blair, the capital, said the Sentinalese, numbering about 100, had been spotted on North Sentinal Island. On Tuesday, the Indian government began taking more aid to affected communities in the archipelago rather than trying to evacuate people to Port Blair and the mainland. But the government continued to bar foreign relief groups from many of the islands, citing a need to protect the indigenous tribes. ''We have plenty of relief material available domestically and can manage with that, but we cannot dilute the policy directive from the top,'' said Rohul Bhagat, an official coordinating nongovernmental organizations. Representatives of international aid groups, who have been confined to the capital, voiced unhappiness with the policy, and some were seeking local partners as a way around the restrictions. ''This is not a very encouraging situation,'' said the representative of one international group, who did not want to be identified. As of Tuesday, nearly 7,000 people were confirmed dead or listed as missing out of a population of 350,000 on the 36 inhabited islands. (There are a total of 572.) More than 9,000 people have been evacuated to Port Blair and 21,000 or more are living in relief camps. ''This is a warlike situation; we are having a war with the nature,'' Air Marshal Shashi Tyagi said after visiting some of the worst-affected coastal areas. The destruction is beyond imagination and several communities had been completely washed away, he added. ''Not even in war have I seen this kind of devastation,'' he said. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: ISLANDS"
"Fresh infusions of aid on Tuesday gave yet more push to the global relief effort for Asia as it confronted monsoon rains, logistical breakdowns and the urgent need for everything from earthmoving equipment to trucks in the struggle to reach the survivors in the most remote areas. Jan Egeland, the United Nations' emergency coordinator, acknowledged the many obstacles but called the global response ''phenomenal.'' He spoke on a day when expectations rose that pledges could far exceed $2 billion before a meeting here on Thursday of donor nations that will discuss how to coordinate the aid. With television broadcasts showing American servicemen delivering aid to victims of the last week's tsunami, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell candidly acknowledged the hope that the United States' military help and its $350 million contribution might improve America's image in the Islamic world. Indonesia, home of two-thirds of the estimated 150,000 people who have died, is the world's most populous Muslim country. ''We'd be doing it regardless of religion,'' Mr. Powell said here on the second day of his tour through the region with Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida. ''But I think it does give the Muslim world and the rest of the world an opportunity to see American generosity, American values in action.'' ''America is not an anti-Islam, anti-Muslim nation,'' Mr. Powell added in his remarks to reporters alongside the Indonesian foreign minister, Hassan Wirajuda. ''America is a diverse society where we respect all religions. And I hope that as a result of our efforts, as a result of our helicopter pilots being seen by the citizens of Indonesia helping them, that value system of ours will be reinforced.'' For his part, Mr. Wirajuda, a Harvard Law School graduate, went out of his way to praise the performance of the American military in the aid effort. ''We particularly appreciate the crucial role that the United States armed forces play in providing helicopters for relief assistance for victims and survivors at the remote and isolated areas,'' he said. The American forces sent so far, which include a crew of nearly 6,000 on the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln, proved essential in launching rescue helicopters on Tuesday after a cargo plane reportedly struck a water buffalo at the airport in Banda Aceh, at the chaotic center of Indonesia's hardest-hit area on the island of Sumatra. The accident closed the runway for much of the day and exposed the vulnerable logistics of what relief and military officials have called the largest aid operation ever. ''We are making extraordinary progress in reaching the majority of people affected in the majority of the areas,'' said Mr. Egeland, the United Nations coordinator. ''We are also experiencing extraordinary obstacles in many, many areas.'' Reuters, citing a government source, reported that Germany was expected to increase its aid contribution to $680 million, from $27 million, which would make the country the biggest single contributor to relief funds. Chancellor Gerhard Schröder promised to announce ''a significant sum'' on Wednesday, the news agency reported. Even as contributions mounted, the United Nations office overseeing relief from Geneva appealed for generators, water purification equipment, some 250 trucks and cargo planes able to land on short runways, which it said only the United States and Britain could provide, according to Reuters. With each day, the relief efforts amounted to a race against time for perhaps tens of thousands among the estimated 400,000 people left injured or without shelter since the earthquake erupted on Dec. 26 and sent wave after wave crashing into Sumatra's western shore. The World Health Organization warned that pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria and many infections, including gangrenous wounds left untended in the tropical heat, were taking an increasing toll in Aceh, Sumatra's most afflicted province. The region around the coastal town of Meulaboh, still inaccessible except by air, remained a particular concern. ''The casualty rates in Meulaboh defy imagination,'' Aitor Lacomba, the Indonesia director of the International Rescue Committee, an aid group, told Reuters. ''Tens of thousands need immediate assistance there.'' Rescue workers were reportedly preparing to use small boats and motorbikes in the hunt for more survivors and to deliver assistance, as helicopters shuttled workers from the international aid group Doctors Without Borders into isolated areas. They reported casualty rates of 70 to 80 percent in some places. ''The people who survive have done that under very difficult circumstances, often surviving on coconuts alone,'' an official of the group, Erwin Vantland, told BBC World TV. ''The picture becomes grimmer and grimmer the more we learn.'' The full scale of the devastation came into sharper focus in other regions as well. Indian officials raised the number of those believed missing on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to more than 6,000. They also came under increasing pressure from international aid groups to allow outside relief workers to tend to more than 21,000 people now sheltered in camps on the islands, which have been closed to protect endangered aboriginal tribes. In Sri Lanka, health officials warned that relentless seasonal rains were slowing the delivery of aid and threatening to spread water-borne disease. Mr. Powell said Myanmar, also known as Burma, the region's most politically isolated nation, did not appear to have suffered severely, according to satellite photographs of the closed country's coastline. Another government official said visitors from the Red Cross and other organizations had confirmed that impression. The Myanmar authorities and aid agencies had announced fewer than 100 deaths, but other authorities believed that the actual toll might be far higher. For the United States, the aid effort that is focused on Indonesia unfolds at a time when America's standing among Muslims is at an all-time low. Since the 9/11 attacks, the State Department has begun a number of public diplomacy campaigns aimed at improving the image of America and emphasizing that it is not hostile to Islam. But with the war in Iraq filling television screens worldwide with images of American soldiers battling in a Muslim land, those messages have often been muted. In Indonesia, which has also suffered terror attacks from extremists in recent years, Mr. Powell said America supported democracy and economic progress globally in part because such change ''dries up those pools of dissatisfaction which might give rise to terrorist activity.'' Earlier in the day, Mr. Powell, accompanied by Governor Bush, President Bush's brother, toured the ruined Thai resort island of Phuket and offered United States technical assistance in helping Thailand to create a regional warning system to protect against future disasters. Standing in the sweltering heat near a wall covered with pictures of the missing, Mr. Powell suggested that the problem of supplying survivors in Thailand was well in hand and that the greatest need here might be for help with the gruesome task of identifying bodies. ''The difficult challenge that I see here this afternoon that I will go back and see what more we can do has to do with identification of remains,'' he said, after meeting with a United States military forensic team that usually handles the remains of American service members missing in action. Thailand's foreign minister, Surakiart Sathirathai, said his government had recorded 5,187 dead, slightly more than half of them foreigners, mostly tourists vacationing at beach resorts. Some 362 bodies have not been identified, including some so badly decomposed that it was impossible to tell whether they were Thai or European, Mr. Surakiart said. An additional 3,810 people are missing. Still, Mr. Powell said the problems of Thailand were modest compared with those of Indonesia, particularly in Aceh Province, which he and Governor Bush are scheduled to visit Wednesday. In addition to Mr. Powell, the donors' meeting on Thursday is expected to be attended by Secretary General Kofi Annan, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan, whose nation has committed $500 million dollars. Before the meeting, pressure was building among European nations to declare, at a minimum, a moratorium on debt payments from the stricken countries. At Bangkok International Airport, Mr. Powell and Mr. Bush got a glimpse of the mountains of donated supplies already arriving in Thailand as they toured storage hangars. Cartons of noodles and bundles of plastic water bottles were stacked on the tarmac next to a drearier sight: piles of empty wooden coffins. Outside in the sun were a heap of local donations, including clothing, blankets and quilts. Andrew Natsios, the administrator of United States Agency for International Development, shook his head at the chaotic scene. ''It all seems so familiar,'' he said. ''People are very generous, but there are distribution problems.'' Still, he added, ''this is better than what I've seen in a lot of places.'' ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: AFTERMATH"
"NATURAL disasters often provoke sharp stock market declines where they occur, usually followed by recoveries that are almost as intense. Ten years ago this week, the Kobe earthquake in Japan sent stocks there tumbling 5 percent before they snapped back. The Sri Lankan market followed a similar path after a tsunami struck on Dec. 26, but it was the exception. Despite the huge devastation, other markets in southern Asia had no big gyrations, and ended the ensuing week flat to higher. The bonds of the affected countries, as well as their currencies -- which can be volatile even in benign circumstances -- suffered few ill effects, either. ''The stock markets in the region have generally not been impacted by the disaster and, in fact, have behaved differently than expected,'' said Mark Mobius, manager of the Templeton Global Emerging Markets fund, in a note to investors. Markets in Indonesia and India ended the trading week after the tsunami more than 1 percent higher, while the Thai and Malaysian markets were little changed. Sri Lanka's market fell sharply immediately after the disaster, then got most of the lost ground back later, ending the week down about 4 percent. In the month ended Friday, stocks rose in all these countries except for India; for American investors, returns were higher in all five countries because their currencies rose against the dollar. Paul Niven, head of strategy at F&C Asset Management, a fund management company in London, pointed out that many Asian stock markets have continued to rally this year. ''Such behavior may seem odd at a time of such unprecedented disaster across numerous countries,'' Mr. Niven said, ''but it does appear that markets are behaving entirely rationally.'' He and other investment professionals say there was no widespread selling because the tsunami damage, though extending for thousands of miles along the Indian Ocean's rim, had negligible impact on industrial capacity. It may seem perverse when juxtaposed with the immense loss of life, analysts say, but the disaster may even produce economic and commercial benefits as rebuilding begins. The tsunami resulted in ''a tragic human loss, but it turns out much of the damage was done in outlying areas where not much of the production is focused,'' said Anthony Chan, an economist at J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management in New York. By contrast, said Mr. Chan, who has studied market effects of past natural disasters, ''if something like that would have hit central Tokyo or Beijing, investors would have hit the sell button.'' But after such events, he said, markets tend to recover as attention shifts to reconstruction and the accelerated economic output that accompanies it. ''Whenever there's a typhoon or other natural disaster, once rebuilding takes place it adds to overall economic growth,'' he said. In the case of the tsunami, he added, ''the huge amount of aid will be a positive contributor to growth.'' Mr. Chan and others drew a distinction between natural disasters and events that originate with human menace or meddling, and they said investors were doing the same. ''Why no panic? People understand that earthquakes haven't suddenly become more likely,'' said Jerome Booth, research director at Ashmore Investment Management, a London firm specializing in emerging markets. He contrasted the tsunami and its randomness with ''the increase in uncertainty surrounding events of terrorism and disease, like SARS.'' He was referring to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, an infectious disease that had a negative effect on Asian markets last year. Ashmore has not cut and run. Mr. Booth says that his Asian equity portfolios are more heavily invested in the southeast area of the region, ''because we see more value there,'' and that he has not changed his outlook as a result of the tsunami. ''In terms of types of stocks, we like Thai banks, Thai infrastructure companies and Indonesian materials companies,'' Mr. Booth said, though he declined to name individual stocks, ''and also telecoms in Indonesia and the Philippines, as mobile businesses are doing well on the back of rising domestic demand.'' He said the tourism industry in southern Asia would bear the brunt of the economic impact. Daniel Lian, a Morgan Stanley economist who follows Southeast Asian markets from Singapore, predicted a limited effect on growth in the region, even in Indonesia, near the epicenter of the earthquake that set off the waves. But he said the economic implications for Thailand were more severe. ''While the six affected Thai provinces account for only 2.7 percent of G.D.P., we believe the damage done to the kingdom's major economic activity, tourism, will have a multiplier effect on the entire economy, as close to a third of Thailand's international tourists visit resort facilities in these provinces,'' Mr. Lian wrote in a note to investors. He said the country might receive only 75 to 80 percent of the number of tourists forecast for this year. Fund managers and analysts are also keeping an eye on industries like transportation and insurance. ''Various insurance companies have been hit, for example Thai Reinsurance and Bangkok Insurance,'' said Hugh Young, the Singapore-based head of equities for Aberdeen Asset Management. He added, though, that insurers are thought to have passed ''a substantial chunk'' of their risk to international reinsurance giants, so the impact ''is not catastrophic.'' Turning to other segments of the market, Mr. Young noted that various companies with tourism businesses had been affected. These include two Sri Lankan companies: Aitken Spence, a tour operator, and John Keells, which has interests in hotels, soft drinks and supermarkets. Mr. Young said the tsunami was ''arguably beneficial for companies involved in reconstruction, for example, Siam Cement.'' Mr. Young said his portfolios held all five of these companies. Mr. Mobius, at Templeton, also favors sectors related to rebuilding coastal areas. ''Construction companies and building materials companies will see more business and probably higher prices,'' he said. ''We are already seeing that happen with cement producers in the region.'' He said cement prices were already starting to rise in Indonesia and expected to climb in Thailand. Mr. Niven, at F&C, agreed that construction companies were benefiting, and said investors had been buying stocks like Semen Gresik, a cement maker in Indonesia, helping to push that market higher. Mr. Mobius and Mr. Young contended that the insurance industry, though suffering somewhat now, might ultimately gain from the tsunami. That is because of ''the possibility of higher premiums and definitely more awareness of the value of insurance itself,'' Mr. Young said. ''Traditionally the countries, businesses and individuals affected would have been underinsured before the disaster,'' he added. Any impact on the insurance industry is likely to be confined to Asia, Mr. Niven said. ''U.S. and European insurers have minimal exposure to claims,'' he said, ''and several, such as Generali, have already stated that there will be no impact on earnings.'' Generali is one of Italy's largest companies. MR. CHAN, at Morgan, said the tsunami might have positive economic and investment implications outside Asia. Tourism-related industries in the affected countries are bound to suffer, but that may mean more business for the same industries elsewhere. ''The airlines that go to those areas will certainly be impacted,'' Mr. Chan said. But he added that ''people are not going to stop traveling.'' ''They will gravitate to areas that make you feel more comfortable or secure,'' he added. ''If you don't take an airline to go there, you take one to go somewhere else. For the airline industry as a whole, it's a wash.'' In the long run, he said, the tsunami may help strengthen Asian economies and markets because ''rebuilding takes place with more modern buildings and equipment, so it raises capabilities'' of manufacturers in the affected economies. The tsunami is ''a forced way to modernize,'' Mr. Chan said. When local companies build homes, factories and infrastructure, ''there will be a lot of expert advice to guide them,'' he said. ''All of that,'' he added, ''is going to enhance productivity and the productive capacity of the region.'' SUNDAY MONEY: INVESTING"
"This town was not just destroyed. It vanished. After almost three weeks, only 323 bodies have been found. Before Dec. 26, when the tsunami swept in from both sides of the pretty tropical peninsula that once cradled Calang, 7,300 people lived here. There is no hint of the 5,627 people missing, and the reality is settling in that 8 in 10 people in Calang were whisked clean away. ''It seems impossible,'' said a student here, Suhardi, 20, still dumbstruck. The waves left little behind, not people and not houses. There is, in fact, almost nothing left to see. Concrete foundations were stripped bare. There is some rubble, though far less than might be expected given that every home, coffee shop, fish restaurant and mosque was leveled, apart from one rich man's manor, now a two-story skeleton of partial walls and bone-white columns. ''There is only one,'' Col. Ikin Sodikin, an Indonesian Army officer, said as he pointed out the sole standing house. He chuckled in resignation, as people sometimes do in the face of things no one can really grasp. ''All Calang has just disappeared,'' he said. Calang is one of many villages on the western coast of Aceh Province wiped from the map of Indonesia, where suffering along the land closest to the earthquake's epicenter has been compounded by its remoteness. In the next village south, Kreung Sabe, half the town's residents died, and all but 500 of the 4,400 people who lived there before the tsunami are homeless. They now must walk seven miles to a port where relief supplies are delivered with what they say is still not enough food or medicine. Just south of Kreung Sabe, a fishing village called Panga and three others nearby were flattened completely, with not a single house standing. In Panga itself, 793 of 1,108 people died, local leaders say, in a place with no airstrip, no port and roads completely washed out. It took a week for the first relief to arrive. Maybe 100 bodies, soldiers say, still lay around a swamp. ''I've been encouraging people to come get them,'' said Lt. Col. Reza Utama, who lost 20 of his own men stationed here. But no body bags or rubber gloves have been delivered, and so Colonel Utama said, ''people are a bit reluctant.'' This strip of coast southwest of the regional capital, Banda Aceh, itself devastated by the tsunami, appears to have suffered some of the worst proportional losses on Dec. 26. In the region hit by the earthquake and then the tsunami, this is also one of the places that help was last to reach. And that assistance, nearly three weeks later, seems both heroic and not quite enough. People complain of surviving on just rice and instant noodles. A local leader in Panga, named Ismaelis, said children were suffering from fever, vomiting and diarrhea. ''We don't mind being orphans if the aid is coming,'' said Sharudin, 18, who lost his parents and four siblings. ''If the aid doesn't come, it would be better if we just died with our parents.'' It is not for lack of trying: American military helicopters, Indonesian ships and aircraft, along with a flotilla of private boats are getting through to most places. (One aid official reported finding a village near Panga on Wednesday where residents said they had not seen any outside help.) But the devastation is so great, the numbers in need so huge, with much terrain accessible only by helicopter. On Wednesday, two aid boats capsized, residents said, in the treacherous surf off Panga. ''It's a lot of people in some really remote places that aren't accessible,'' Maurice Knight, with the private consulting company International Resources Group, of Washington, D.C., said on a boat trip this week along the coast as part of his work coordinating relief efforts. ''I think the fact is that it's going to have to be a scaling up, and that is going to take two months.'' But time is not unlimited: Rick Brennan, the health director for the aid group International Rescue Committee, camped out for two days here, said enough supplies were getting in to keep people basically fed and healthy. There are no signs of child malnutrition or outbreaks of serious diseases like cholera. He estimated, though, that 80 percent of the children had suffered from diarrhea, and sanitation in ever-more-crowded refugee camps is far from adequate to ensure health or prevent major disease outbreaks. ''From a humanitarian point of view, we need to move quickly,'' he said. Perhaps more than any other place hit by the tsunami, the focus here is on the living -- on getting food and medicine here more quickly, of drafting plans to resettle the homeless into refugee camps that are safe, clean and accessible. And perhaps more than anywhere else, there is no choice but to think more about the living, because so few of the dead have been found. Unlike elsewhere, there are no mass graves in this town, no patrols uncovering dozens of bodies a day. The few bodies that have been found were buried in small groups near where they lay. Zulfian Ahmad, 53, the governor of the province around Calang, has not found any trace of his wife or four of his five children, lost while he was away in Jakarta on business. He has not seen a single one of his neighbors. ''Families are trying to find their relatives,'' he said, sitting on a mat in a tent where he has set up a makeshift office, complete with a typewriter and stacks of papers. ''But the government believes they are dead. So we have to focus on the refugees.'' The destruction was so complete that it is hard to find anyone who lived in Calang in the throng of refugees crowded here by the beach, smoky from campfires as they combed through piles of donated clothing and waited for food rations. One man from a nearby village told a story similar to others along this coast: of a quake of tremendous strength, of a sea that receded and suddenly rushed back in fury. Near Calang, he said, he watched three waves from the top of a hill where he escaped with his family. ''When the waves came, the coconut trees just smashed like a potato chip crushed in your hand,'' he said. The first wave, he said, came ''fast and hard,'' destroying the trees and houses. The second was smaller. ''The third one was the biggest, and it just swept everything away,'' he said. In Calang, once a jumping-off point for tourists to see orangutans, bears and tigers, geography may have been one reason for the destruction. The town rested on a peninsula, and people here said the waves had crashed from both sides, pushing some people inland but most of them simply out to sea. In that sea, groups of boys have begun swimming again, throwing themselves daringly into the waves and dangling off the big ropes that moor two Indonesian military ships here to keep order and to oversee the aid operation. If they are afraid, they will not say so. ''I don't see any dead bodies,'' said one boy, Yuli, who said he was 12 but looked more like 8. An older boy, Wande, 14, watched them in the water from not far away. ''You know, they know that people died, but they have trauma,'' he said. ''They don't want to talk about it. They just want to play.'' ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: ABSENT REMAINS"
"Indonesia announced Wednesday that all foreign troops assisting in the relief operation must leave by late March. Sensitive to the impression that it was relying too heavily on outside military forces and wanting to assert control over the relief operation, the government set a deadline of March 26 -- three months after the tsunami struck -- but said it hoped to phase out the foreign troops even earlier. A number of countries have sent or are sending troops to help. The United States military has taken a major role, flying daily helicopter runs to ferry food to isolated villages devastated by the wave and bringing wounded people to hospitals here in the provincial capital. The Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and two other Navy vessels have been cruising off the coast here to provide support. American soldiers delivering the aid return to their ships at night. Some of the large contingents of foreign troops, particularly from neighboring Singapore, have brought heavy equipment -- bulldozers and backhoes -- to clear smashed buildings and the debris here and in Meulaboh, a city on Sumatra's west coast that was severely damaged. Australian troops, which were the first to arrive, are to be complemented by a naval ship due on Thursday. The Indonesian vice president, Jusuf Kalla, announced the deadline to Antara, the state news agency, saying that the foreign troops could stay ''no longer than three months'' and that Indonesia would be better off if they left sooner. In Washington, the White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said that the administration was ''seeking further clarification'' on the timetable from Jakarta, but that the United States was committed to helping rebuild the devastated areas. ''This is a long-term effort, and the United States will be there for the long haul,'' he said, ''to help people in the region get the relief they need and to reconstruct their cities and reconstruct their lives.'' The timetable for the withdrawal of foreign troops was made public a day after the commander of the Indonesian military announced restrictions on the movement of foreign aid workers. The Indonesian military has fought a civil war against separatist rebels here for 30 years and has kept the province of Aceh virtually sealed to outsiders in that period. The new president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, is a former general and a strong defender of the military role in the province. Western military officials said the Indonesian Army, the backbone of the nation's strong sense of sovereignty, has been cooperative but is touchy about the foreign troops working here. The governments of India and Thailand, nations also hit by the tsunami, said they could cope on their own. But out of a total death toll exceeding 150,000, Indonesia accounts for more than 100,000 and it accepted help from foreign troops when it became clear that its own military could not deal with the devastation. Still, in the last several days, a groundswell of opinion has emerged in the capital, Jakarta, that the foreign forces threatened Indonesia's sovereignty, a Western diplomat said. An anonymous text message comparing American intentions in Aceh to its invasion of Iraq was widely circulated on cellphones in the capital this week. It read, ''After Iraq, will Indonesia be the next U.S. target?'' To compensate for the departing foreign troops, the military will send three more battalions of soldiers and a battalion of ''mobile brigade'' police, the Indonesian government said. Those brigades are generally the forces most feared by Aceh's civilians, who regularly describe them as the most brutal of the array of government forces here. Explaining the decision to limit the stay of foreign troops, a senior government official, State Secretary Sudi Silalahi, said, ''It is not proper for us to keep on relying on overseas aid.'' He added: ''We are going to intensify the use of domestic resources to gradually take over the humanitarian operation. By March 26 we expect to have control of the situation.'' But the huge task of clearing debris here in Banda Aceh has barely begun, and it is unclear how much can be done in the coming weeks. Even as the government announced the deadline, some of the foreign troops that have been pledged to help are still on their way. The Spanish foreign minister, Miguel _ngel Moratinos, said Wednesday night in Jakarta that a naval vessel was scheduled to leave Spain on Thursday and would not arrive here until next month. The ship will carry a military hospital, heavy machinery and an engineering unit capable of building roads, he said. Two Spanish military transport aircraft are set to land in Aceh on Thursday, he said. An amphibious Australian Navy ship with 150 military engineers and bulldozers and heavy forklifts is also to arrive in Aceh on Thursday to help restore ruined bridges and roads. Paul D. Wolfowitz, the American deputy secretary of defense, who is a former ambassador to Indonesia, is to visit the area this weekend. He is to go to Jakarta, where he and senior Indonesian officials are to discuss the possible renewal of military relations between the United States and Indonesia. The Bush administration has wanted to restore the military relationship, which was cut by President Bill Clinton in the early 1990's on the ground that the Indonesian military had committed human rights abuses, particularly in East Timor. Congress has blocked efforts to lift a ban on the sale of military equipment. But last week, in a gesture that signaled Washington's desire for better relations with the Indonesian military, the administration lifted a ban on spare parts for Indonesia's military transport planes. Martial law was in place here through most of the 1990's and was imposed again in 2003. Though it was officially lifted last year, many of the regulations remained in place. The conflict here has meant that a disproportionate number of Indonesian troops were deployed here compared with the rest of the country and resentment of the soldiers is widespread. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: RELIEF OPERATION"
"Until last week, few experts or governments gave much thought to the likelihood of tsunamis in the Indian Ocean. Most of the focus was on the Pacific. But in an article in an Australian government publication last September, scientists used a computer simulation to demonstrate that an underwater quake in 1833, originating just a few hundred miles south of the 2004 epicenter, spawned a ferocious tsunami that swept the Indian Ocean and pulverized some of the same coastlines. The 1833 quake may have registered as high as 9.2 in magnitude, compared with 9.0 this time. According to the simulation, developed by Dr. Phil Cummins and his colleagues at Geoscience Australia, that nation's agency for earth-science research, the quake generated offshore waves eight inches to five feet in height. Depending on the coastline, tsunami waves can swell enormously when they reach the shore. A wave with offshore height of just eight inches is capable of producing a damaging tsunami at certain coasts. Historical accounts of the 1833 tsunami are rare, Dr. Cummins said. It would have ravaged Sumatra and, to a lesser extent, parts of Australia. But its force was largely directed away from the Bay of Bengal, where much of the devastation took place last week. ANAHAD O'CONNOR"
"The Cascadia fault, a 600-mile-long collision between two chunks of the earth's crust off the Pacific Northwest coast, has been quiet for a long time, and that is not a comforting fact. Major earthquakes occur somewhere in the world every year or two. Catastrophic tsunamis -- giant waves generated by undersea earthquakes or landslides -- strike less often, and some of the largest of tsunamis originate in places that do not, at first glance, appear particularly treacherous. The devastating tsunamis created Dec. 26 by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake that killed as many as 150,000 people on the shores of the Indian Ocean caught the world off guard, including most tsunami experts. ''Here is something that we didn't foresee,'' said Dr. Costas E. Synolakis, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Southern California. Dr. Synolakis said that experts would now take a closer look at the Indian Ocean and that he expected that they would find geological evidence of earlier tsunamis, which would allow scientists to estimate how often they occur. ''We're going to have a much better idea of what the hazard is,'' he said, ''because right now we don't know.'' Observations of the destruction will also provide a check to their computer models and could provide insight into the earthquake, the first magnitude 9.0 in 40 years, that produced them. Like the Cascadia fault, the Indian Ocean fault is also at a place, known as a subduction zone, where one tectonic plate plunges beneath another, and up to 600 miles of the fault ruptured. The overlying plate jumped upward more than 15 feet, lifting the water above it and setting off the tsunami. An earthquake about as strong as last week's struck Cascadia in 1700, sending tsunamis across the Pacific. Seismologists foresee a repeat. The question is, When? There are warning systems in the Pacific and plans up and down the coast to cope with such a disaster, which is a situation far different from that on the shores of the Indian Ocean. Only in the last year or so did Dr. Phil Cummins, an Australian seismologist who was at the vanguard of concern, conclude that a disastrous tsunami was possible. When it occurred, he was still preparing a position paper that marshaled evidence of past tsunamis and pressed for an international warning system. He had already been urging awareness of the danger in presentations to scientists in Japan and Hawaii. Tsunamis seem to be among the most mysterious of natural disasters, but scientists know a good deal about how they occur and are working to understand them better. Tsunamis follow the same laws of physics as ordinary surf waves generated by wind. The difference is size. For wind-driven waves, the distance between wave crests -- the wavelength -- is at most a few hundred yards. For tsunamis, that wavelength can be a hundred miles or more. Because the wavelength is so much greater than the ocean depth, the speed of the wave depends on that depth. In water 2.5 miles deep, the average depth in the Pacific, a tsunami travels almost as fast as a jetliner, 440 miles an hour. Ships at sea notice nothing. As a tsunami races past, the ocean surface rises and falls slightly, a few feet at most, over a period of several minutes to a couple of hours. Underwater, the effects are more pronounced. The downward pressure of a surf wave dissipates a few hundred yards below the surface, while the pressure force of a tsunami extends to the ocean bottom. That led the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to develop instruments it has named tsunameters. With six deployed in middle of the Pacific since 2001 in waters 2.5 to 4 miles deep, the tsunameters can detect the perturbations in water pressure as a tsunami passes above. When it detects something, it sends a signal by sound waves to a buoy on the surface. The signal is relayed to a satellite and then back to earth to tsunami warning centers in Hawaii and Alaska. ''That whole thing only takes two minutes to get the signal through,'' said Christian Meinig, engineering division leader at the N.O.A.A.'s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, which designed and built the tsunameters. No significant tsunamis have yet occurred in the Pacific for the tsunameters to detect, but they have prevented a false alarm. In November 2003, a magnitude 7.8 undersea earthquake occurred near the Aleutian Islands, spurring officials to issue a tsunami warning. When the wave passed over a tsunameter, they saw it was small and canceled the warning. While there is a good understanding of how tsunamis travel in the deep ocean, less is known about how they crash ashore. Dr. Harry Yeh, professor of ocean engineering at Oregon State University, leaves tomorrow for India, one of several scientists who will survey the wounds of the tsunami on the coast. In particular, the scientists want to record the height of the tsunami waves as they crashed onto land. ''Sometimes you can see by the scar marks on the tree,'' he said. Elsewhere, they might find mud marks on building walls or collect accounts from survivors. ''Those data are very perishable,'' Dr. Yeh said. As cleanup begins, the telltale signs are wiped away, and survivors' stories often change, as their personal memories are affected by what they have heard and read. Videos captured of the tsunami seemed to pale next to the cataclysmic imaginings of Hollywood movies, but ''looking at the videos, you would be fooled,'' said Dr. Synolakis of U.S.C. For one, those who tried to videotape more imposing waves might not have survived. But also, unlike an ordinary wave, which quickly dissipates and rolls back out, a tsunami is a long sheet of water. ''Behind the wave is a change in sea level coming in,'' Dr. Synolakis said. ''The wave is coming and coming and coming. A three- or four-meter tsunami can be quite devastating.'' One cubic yard of water weighs nearly a ton, and a tsunamis come ashore at speeds of about 30 miles an hour. An oncoming tsunami can hit a building with millions of pounds of force, said Dr. Peter E. Raad, a professor of mechanical engineering at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. ''And that's before you put anything in the water,'' he said. Trees, automobiles and pieces of concrete all become lethal projectiles as they are swept along by the rushing water. Computer simulations by Dr. Raad aim to improve the understanding of the rushing waters in order to construct buildings that better withstand tsunamis. For example, the lower floors may have walls that break away when hit, but the support columns may survive and hold up the upper stories, he said. A parking garage may be placed away from the beach to prevent cars from being swept away, he said. Tsunamis caused by underwater landslides can be even more destructive. In 1998, seismologists were surprised when a modest magnitude 7.0 earthquake off Papua New Guinea was followed by a 30-foot-high tsunami that killed more than 2,100 people. The earthquake, it turned out, had caused nearly a cubic mile of sediment to give way. Three-dimensional maps of the bottom of California's Monterey Bay show several sections that have given way -- and others that have cracked and may collapse in the future. Some scientists have suggested that the outer edge of the East Coast's continental shelf is also prone to cave-ins. Others, including Dr. Steven N. Ward of the University of California, Santa Cruz, have warned that the volcano Cumbre Vieja in the Canary Islands off northwestern Africa could be nearing one of its periodic collapses. As the volcano grows through eruptions, the sides become unstable and eventually fall into the ocean. During the last eruption in 1949, a two-mile-long crack opened up and one side of the volcano slid 10 feet. ''Geologically, we're getting close to the end,'' Dr. Ward said. ''It's really the cycle of life for these volcanoes. They grow too big, they collapse.'' In Dr. Ward's computer models, when Cumbre Vieja collapses -- and that may not happen for hundreds of thousands of years -- about 100 cubic miles of rock will slide into the ocean at speeds greater than 200 miles per hour, and the splash will generate tsunamis 300 feet high crashing into the northwestern coast of Africa. Waves 40 feet high will reach New York. Other scientists have pointed out that such catastrophic landslides are very rare -- Cumbre Vieja last collapsed 500,000 years ago -- and that there is no geologic evidence of such mega-tsunami in the past. They suggest that the landslides will not accelerate quickly enough to produce the waves Dr. Ward envisions. Even more catastrophically -- and even more rarely -- may be tsunamis caused by asteroids' crashing into an ocean. In 1998, researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory reported that a three-mile-wide asteroid hitting the middle of the Atlantic Ocean at 40,000 miles per hour would send tsunamis that would crash tens of miles inland. Such asteroid impacts, fortunately, occur only every 10 million years or so. The tsunami that hit Washington State in 1700 was not of such gigantic proportions, but it was big. And evidence of it was recognized only two decades ago. Until a couple of decades ago, the Cascadia fault, where a piece of ocean floor the size of Oregon and known as the Juan de Fuca plate disappears beneath North America, was also considered a low seismic threat. Oregon and Washington have far fewer earthquakes than California, and few in the northern states have caused much damage. In 1987, Dr. Brian F. Atwater, a geologist with the United States Geological Survey, discovered near the mouth of the Columbia River and in several other estuaries in Washington the scars of a large tsunami, including spruce tree forests that had suddenly turned into salt water tidal flats when the land elevation dropped several feet. ''There must be tens of thousands of stumps in the estuaries,'' he said. Dr. Atwater also found layers of sand that had been washed in. Radiocarbon dating and examination of the tree rings placed the trees' death in 1700. Historical records from Japan pinned down an exact date and almost an exact time for the earthquake -- 9 p.m. Jan. 26, 1700. The Japanese documents described 10-foot waves that washed away about a dozen houses in a fishing village on the east coast of Japan nine hours later. Computer simulations by Dr. Kenji Satake of the Active Fault Research Center in Japan indicate that for 10-foot waves to reach Japan, the Cascadia earthquake that generated them was huge, between magnitude 8.7 and 9.2, rupturing the entire 600-mile fault. The 1700 earthquake was not a singular event in the Cascadia subduction zone. Dr. Atwater's sediments show evidence of seven earthquakes there in the past 3,500 years ago. For now, the Juan de Fuca and North American tectonic plates are locked tight against each other, accounting for the seismic lull. But as the Juan de Fuca plate pushes inexorably to the northeast, pressure along the Cascadia is building, seismologists are certain that it will break again, most likely unleashing another volley of tsunamis. The interval between earthquakes has been roughly 300 to 1,000 years. It has been 305 years since the 1700 earthquake. Scientists will not be surprised if one occurs tomorrow, or several centuries from now. ''Geologically soon,'' said Dr. Yeh of Oregon State, ''is 1,000 years or 100 years.''"
"The newspaper Al Qabas in Kuwait set off a debate spreading throughout the country and beyond on Monday by suggesting that Kuwait deserves its reputation for being cheap and oblivious to people who go there to work as servants, given the relatively low level of aid it has donated to the tsunami victims at a time when the state treasury is bursting with an oil bonanza. Noting that the bulk of the nannies, drivers, menial laborers and other servants who keep most households running in the emirate come from Southeast Asia -- imported workers easily outnumber the native population -- some Kuwaitis agree that the country and its Persian Gulf neighbors need to be doing much more. But the campaign to shut down Islamic charities accused of financing terrorism has left many people confused about where to turn when they do want to donate money. And a few extremist Friday Prayer leaders and other religious commentators fueled the uncertainty by suggesting that the tsunami destruction was the wrath of God. Gauging the extent of private donations for the region proved difficult because nobody seems to be collecting the information. Many donations are channeled through the government-backed Red Crescent societies, but senior officials either did not return phone calls or said they were too busy to make a tally. There were random charitable acts around the region. In an echo of the debate about skinflints that occurred in the United States over the government's level of aid, though, a front-page editorial in Al Qabas on Sunday said gulf Arabs had an obligation to dig deeper in their pockets for the people of Southeast Asia because of the longstanding ties between the two regions. ''We have to give them more; we are rich,'' Waleed al-Nusif, the editor in chief of Al Qabas, said in a telephone interview. ''The price of oil doubled, so we have no excuse.'' After the paper's editorial appeared, the Kuwaiti cabinet raised its announced donation on Sunday to $10 million, from $2 million, having previously doubled it. Kuwait is expected to run a budget surplus this year of roughly $10 billion, and Mr. Nusif noted that the government had just distributed an estimated $700 million to the Kuwaiti people themselves, the public share of the unanticipated revenue. He said Kuwait should give a minimum of $100 million, not least because many of the country's 1.29 million foreigners of a total population of 2.25 million come from the devastated regions. ''They built Kuwait, and they raised our children,'' said Mr. Nusif, noting that before successive oil booms, India and other countries opened their doors to Kuwaitis, who were then relatively poor. The paper also advised Kuwaitis to check with their housemaids to see if they wanted to phone home in case family members were dead or missing. It was not the kind of reminder necessary for an older generation of Kuwaitis, Mr. Nusif said. ''Our fathers were more generous than we are,'' he said. ''They had suffered more.'' The editorial became the hot topic in diwaniyas, the nightly salons where men gather to chew over the issues of the day. ''We should show more sympathy, especially since we have a budget surplus and these are our neighbors in Southeast Asia,'' said Saad al-Ajmi, a former Kuwaiti minister of information. He believes more private donations will be coming. The Qabas editorial did not cite Kuwait alone in seeking to fatten donations. It said all the Arab gulf countries benefiting from huge oil revenues should give more. Qatar and Saudi Arabia have each pledged $10 million, while Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan, the ruler of the United Arab Emirates, raised his country's cash contribution tenfold, to $20 million, on Monday night. Most pledges from the gulf Arab nations were made in the first hours after the earthquake, and as the scale becomes apparent, more money will be pledged, officials said. The Islamic Development Bank in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, said it would distribute $10 million in emergency aid to Indonesia, the Maldives, Somalia, Thailand, India and Sri Lanka. The Thai Embassy in Kuwait said some people were dropping by to give money, with one business phoning to say it wanted to bring $14,000. The Kuwaiti Embassy in Jakarta announced that it was chartering a ship to deliver aid to devastated Aceh Province in Indonesia. In Riyadh, the Saudi capital, Dr. Saleh al-Tuwaijri, vice president of the Saudi Red Crescent Society, said the government's $10 million donation would go directly to sister organizations in the affected countries. He said that per capita giving in the gulf was generally high, but that ordinary citizens faced obstacles to making donations because so many private charities had been closed under American pressure on suspicion of helping finance terrorism. No replacement mechanism has been established, which makes public fund-raising difficult, he said. In Kuwait, some charities drew fire by advertising that they were collecting money for Muslim victims. Indonesia, the hardest-hit country, is the most populous Muslim nation. ''I don't know why only Muslims, when disasters do not differentiate between religions in choosing their victims,'' Muhammad Mousaed al-Saleh, a columnist, wrote in Al Qabas. The daily paper published a religious ruling, saying donating to non-Muslims is permissible. The view that wanton behavior provoked the quake was the subject of Friday sermons in Saudi Arabia and of other religious commentaries. ''Asia's earthquake, which hit the beaches of prostitution, tourism, immorality and nudity,'' one commentator said on an Islamist Web site, ''is a sign that God is warning mankind from persisting in injustice and immorality before he destroys the ground beneath them.'' Walid Tabtabai, a member of the Kuwaiti Parliament, said the earthquake was a message. ''We believe that what occurs in terms of disasters and afflictions is a test for believers and punishment for the unjust,'' he wrote in a column in the newspaper Al Watan.

"The greatest outpouring of disaster relief on record has been promised for the victims of the worst natural disaster of our time, a stupendous display of good will and empathy for the huge suffering and loss in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, India, Somalia and the other devastated countries. Now, how does the world get it to those who need it? President Bush, who embarrassed Americans with his initial offer of a piddling $15 million, should be commended for increasing the government's pledge to $350 million. Japan quickly followed suit, raising its promised amount to $500 million from $30 million. And Norway, just yesterday, announced that it is adding $160 million to its initial pledge, for a total of about $180 million, a whopping amount from a country with a gross domestic product figure that's half the size of New Jersey's. The foremost challenge now is to ensure that the money pledged in the glow of the media spotlight gets to the people who need it. That is the job of the United Nations, which has a chance to redeem itself after the oil-for-food scandal. It must make sure that the money is not diverted into the hands of corrupt government officials or used as a political weapon by armies waging counterinsurgency campaigns in some of the most stricken areas. Right now in Indonesia, cartons of food, water and medical supplies are stacking up in airports, not getting to the villages that were hit the hardest. Part of the problem is the Indonesian military. Complaints have already arisen about soldiers siphoning off supplies for their relatives and friends. But Indonesian government officials bear some blame. Take, for example, the remarkably callous dismissal of reports of hungry families in leveled towns made by Alwi Shihab, the country's senior disaster response coordinator: ''I can guarantee you there is no starvation, except for me, because I didn't have lunch today.'' This is hardly the face the Indonesian government should want to present to a traumatized population. Furthermore, the money must be sent, not just pledged. The Bush administration is notorious for promising wonderful pots of money when the cameras are rolling -- the Monterey summit meeting on poverty nearly three years ago comes to mind -- and then failing to follow through once the attention fades. Victims of the earthquake in Bam, Iran, a year ago are still living in tents because aid, including American aid, has fallen short. In 2002 in Monterey, Mr. Bush announced a Millennium Challenge Account to give African nations development assistance of up to $5 billion a year. We're still waiting for the account to actually hand out so much as a dollar. Of more lasting importance than getting money to the tsunami victims is working to ensure that when the next disaster hits, fewer are killed. That can happen only if America and other rich countries spend more on development aid, not just disaster relief. Emergency aid is a Band-Aid; development aid is a vaccine. Rich countries like America and the European nations have the firm foundations necessary to help fight nature's wrath, including early warning systems and sound housing structures. Last fall, severe storms hit Haiti and Florida. Haiti lost around 2,000 lives; Florida lost about 100. The horrific casualties inflicted by the tsunamis are the face of poverty today. So many lives could have been spared with basic things like an emergency response system or local shelters built on high ground. The aid to the tsunami victims must not come out of the same pot used for development aid. It's clear that in the yearly lottery of disaster aid, the tsunami survivors will get the most. But that doesn't mean that the eight million people who die every year from preventable diseases like malaria should end up losers -- again. Editorial Correction: January 27, 2005, Thursday An editorial on Jan. 4 incorrectly described the American role in helping victims of the earthquake in Bam, Iran. The United States delivered on its pledge within days. It was not among the countries that failed to meet their commitments. An editorial on Jan. 21 about a proposal to make Jacques Chirac a senator after he finishes his term as French president incorrectly said that legislation doing so had been introduced. The bill's author said he had decided to do further work after it came under public criticism."
"LAUREN HUTTON is the Zelig of travel. Wherever one goes, there inevitably Ms. Hutton will be. No secret Caribbean surf break, remote African boma, former Vietcong tunnel or Bhutanese dzong, it seems, is obscure enough to eliminate the possibility that one will encounter the gaptoothed model with the iffy filmography and the irresistible Marlboro baritone. A fine example turns up in the January issue of W, a magazine whose target audience Ms. Hutton has often been hired to symbolize. It happened that the writer of the article, Kevin West, was in the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania in search of lions, elephants, cheetahs or giraffes. Instead ''while watching elephants feed in a woody area,'' Mr. West writes, he spied Ms. Hutton ''sitting yoga style atop a Range Rover.'' It always happens. Pick an exotic locale and expect to bump into the ever-expanding cadre of global nomads, a group whose membership is far from limited to people who keep a bar tab at the Soho House. There was a time -- Hemingway's time -- when risky travel was exclusively the province of the very rich; it was one of the ways in which they were so different from you and me. But the sort of adventure formerly associated with types who carry numerals after their names is now within the reach of a lot of people. This has never been clearer than since the Indian Ocean tsunami. If the catastrophe made one thing apparent it is that ''the Lonely Planet'' is now a misnomer. Lauren Hutton may never have visited the Andaman Islands, but a surprising number of Westerners have. Over three million Americans live abroad, and despite terrorism, war and the threat of contagion, foreign travel from the United States is rebounding, say those in the travel industry. At a minimum, travel brings home to the average cosseted Westerner a truth well understood by the great proportion of the world's population: that life is a tenuous proposition, a fragile entity. The globe keeps contracting. Untrammeled places become harder to find as tourism in all its ecoadventurous or five-star or backpacking or bungee-jumping diversity closes in. The rules of engagement change with the times, and among the crucial alterations is the abridgment of that magical sense of invincibility so many have tended to toss into their duffels whenever they take off. Still, it is a surprise to learn how many people with the visa stamps and frequent-flier miles to qualify as bona fide global nomads still adhere to Helen Keller's observation that ''life is either a daring adventure or nothing.'' Trying to avoid danger may in the long run be no safer than outright exposure to danger, as Keller once famously remarked. In the aftermath of last month's catastrophe it is startling to learn how many travelers treat Keller's dictum as a rallying cry. ''Trying to control the whole scenario is futile'' when one travels, said William Sofield, the New York-based designer whose projects include 400 Gucci boutiques around the world. To call Mr. Sofield well-traveled is seriously to understate the case; during one recent stretch he commuted twice weekly between London and Tokyo. For recreation he ventures mainly to South Asia where, along with garden variety worries like Delhi belly, it turns out that visitors run an increased risk of encountering earthquakes, landslides, cyclones, tsunamis or floods. The odds are low of course and, to haul out a hoary statistic, one is in more imminent peril every time one gets in a car. Yet the horror of 150,000 deaths should be enough to test the nerve of even the most stalwart fatalist. ''I was once in a plane that crashed, so it's not that I assume I'm safe,'' said Mr. Sofield, referring to a commuter flight that skidded on its belly while landing at La Guardia Airport during a snowstorm. ''And I've had enough experience of being met in the small plane somewhere by people with Uzis accusing someone on the plane of smuggling.'' For all that Mr. Sofield's experience rings of a Bond film subplot, it is real and by no means unique. Peril comes in a variety of forms. Since 1992, as Ann Hagedorn Auerbach wrote in ''Ransom: The Untold Story of International Kidnapping'' (Henry Holt, 1998), tribesmen in Yemen have abducted at least 100 foreigners, including many tourists, ransoming them for cash, luxury cars, high military posts and of all things public sector jobs. Kidnapping in general has soared, Ms. Auerbach wrote, to 6,500 in Latin America alone in 1995 from a total of 951 in 73 countries between 1968 and 1982. Cambodia, Kashmir, the Philippines, Colombia and Mexico are a few of the places where there is a better than average likelihood of being abducted. And while a majority of these crimes involve locals and not tourists, plenty of travelers are happy to chance the distinction. Certainly there are worse things than the ''bad roads and indifferent inns'' that Edward Gibbon bemoaned in the 18th century. Yet there are those for whom the urge to travel broadly, to track what the journalist Alexander Cockburn termed ''the lost valleys of the imagination,'' or at least a pastel cocktail on a distant white sand beach, prove compelling enough to expose oneself to risk. As has never been clearer, risk is the constant, the unwelcome reality underpinning all the tempting commercial come-ons and the brochure blandishments. ''There really is no such thing as security,'' said David Herndon, the executive editor of Caribbean Travel & Life, whose wanderings have taken him throughout the Indian Ocean region, the South Pacific and Africa. ''I was once in a forgotten part of Ethiopia surrounded by 90 percent naked warrior tribesmen toting AK's when I could have been safe and snug in New York City,'' Mr. Herndon said. The date was Sept. 11, 2001. Robert Morea, a personal fitness trainer in New York, received a similar lesson in the strange workings of fate on a visit to Cuba during the Havana Film Festival in 2003. On the flight to the Caribbean Mr. Morea befriended a young director from New York and made tentative plans to meet him the next day for a drink at the Hotel Nacional. When Mr. Morea arrived for the rendezvous it was only to discover that his new acquaintance had been found that morning unconscious in the street; he died in a Havana hospital later that week. ''It was the suddenness that shocked me,'' said Mr. Morea, who has traveled through Europe on bicycle and once departed from a Mexican city shortly before a leftist insurrection. ''Whether he had been drugged or had a bad reaction to something, I don't know. But you never think this stuff can happen to you, Mr. Invincible, or anyone you know.'' But it can and does, and yet somehow travel to destinations where it pays to be sure that one's travel insurance has a repatriation clause seems to maintain its appeal. It is true that following the Dec. 26 tsunami hotel bookings in Thailand and Sri Lanka plummeted. But one would have a hard time trying to find a room right now in Bhutan. Far from dissuading people from following their nomadic paths, the tsunami has added to indulgence another level of ethical awareness. ''It brings to the forefront that every moment is truly precious and to take advantage of everything life has to offer,'' said Judith Wendell, a Manhattan feng shui consultant and seasoned traveler who has no plans, she said, to cancel a trip to South India. ''I am not deterred'' from travel by the tsunami, Ms. Wendell said. ''I am inspired but for different reasons.'' As remote Laotian villagers become wired for the Internet and Rajasthani villagers start bartering with tourists over pornographic DVD's the intrepid will continue hone their map skills as they hunt down the few remaining untracked places: Siberia, the Gobi and what Lauren Hutton herself refers to as ''the 'stans.'' ''I came to New York to get to Africa and became a model so I could travel and get past the accident of my birth,'' Ms. Hutton, snowbound in a New Mexico cabin, said by telephone on Thursday. For the past quarter century she has spent six months of each year traveling mainly to what used to be called the Third World, she said, places where ''fishermen are actually fishing and not selling T-shirts.'' Without travel ''I would have wound up a little ignorant white Southern female, which was not my idea of a good life,'' said Ms. Hutton, who has experienced her share of travel mishaps, among them elephant charges and a near-fatal motorcycle crash. ''You try to develop a little wisdom'' and some rules of the road, explained Ms. Hutton, whose determined pursuit of ''places where the tourists can't get'' has most recently led her to learn dog sledding in Antarctica. ''You never want to go into any war, and you always try to learn who's been getting shot or hacked or whacked,'' she added. ''You talk to everybody you can talk to, get the best maps and try to learn how to get out of wherever you got yourself in.''"
"As the horror of the South Asian tsunami spread and people gathered online to discuss the disaster on sites known as Web logs, or blogs, those of a political bent naturally turned the discussion to their favorite topics. To some in the blogosphere, it simply had to be the government's fault. On Democratic Underground, a blog for open discussion and an online gathering place for people who hate the Bush administration, a participant asked, ''Since we know that the atmosphere has become contaminated by all the atomic testing, space stuff, electronic stuff, earth pollutants, etc., is it logical to wonder if: Perhaps the 'bones' of our earth where this earthquake spawned have also been affected?'' The cause of the earthquake and resulting killer wave, the writer said, could be the war in Iraq. ''You know, we've exploded many millions of tons of ordnance upon this poor planet,'' the writer said. ''All that 'shock and awe' stuff we've just dumped onto the Asian part of this earth -- could we have fractured something? Perhaps the earth was just reacting to something that man has done to injure it. The earth is organic, you know. It can be hurt.'' The ridicule began immediately. Online insults, referred to colloquially as flames, rose high on other sites. ''What would life be without D.U.?'' asked an editor at Wizbang, a politically conservative blog (www.wizbangblog.com), using the initials of Democratic Underground. ''Get out the tin foil hats,'' a contributor to the blog wrote. The interplay between the sites, left and right, is typical of the rumbles in cyberspace between rivals at different ends of the political spectrum. In many ways, Web logs shone after the tsunami struck: bloggers in the regions posted compelling descriptions of the devastation, sometimes by text messages sent from their cellphones as they roamed the countryside looking for friends and family members. And blogs were quick to create links to charities so that people could help online. But the blogosphere's tendency toward crackpot theorizing and political smack down could not be suppressed for long. ''It's so much of what they feed on, so much of what they are,'' said James Surowiecki, the author of ''The Wisdom of Crowds.'' Blogs have gone from obscurity to ubiquity in a blink. Bloggers were selected as ''People of the Year'' by ABC News, and Merriam-Webster declared ''blog'' its ''word of the year.'' According to a study released yesterday by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, more than eight million Americans have started blogs, and 27 percent of Internet users surveyed said they read blogs -- a 58 percent jump since last February -- and 12 percent of Internet users have posted comments to blogs. Still, 62 percent of Americans say they are not sure what the term ''blog'' means. Odd blog postings are not just for commoners. Norodom Sihanouk, the former king of Cambodia, posted a message in French to his Web site, www.norodomsihanouk.info, saying that an astrologer had warned him that an ''ultra-catastrophic cataclysm'' would strike the region, but Cambodia would be undamaged if the proper rituals were observed. King Sihanouk said that the thousands of dollars he spent on the ceremonies protected his nation from the disaster, and that he would donate $15,000 to disaster relief. Mr. Surowiecki pointed out that there is nothing new about ill-informed rumor-mongering or other forms of oddness. ''There were always cranks,'' he said. ''Rumors have always been fundamental about the way people talk, or think, about politics or complicated issues.'' Instead of a corner bar or a Barcalounger, however, the location for today's speech is an online medium with a potential audience of millions. But there is another, more important difference, Mr. Surowiecki and others say. Internet discourse can be self-correcting, with near-instant feedback from readers. What was lost in the sniping over the Democratic Underground posting was the fact that the follow-up comments were a sober discussion of what actually causes earthquakes. The first response to the posting asked, ''Earthquakes have been happening since the beginning of time How would you explain them?'' Further comments explained the movement of tectonic plates and provided links to sites explaining earthquakes and tsunamis from the United States Geological Survey and other authoritative sources. ''Not to make fun, as I'm sure it's not a unique misconception but the reality is simple plate tectonics,'' one participant wrote. ''The entire Pacific Ocean is slowly but surely closing in on itself. What happened is that the floor of the Indian Ocean slid over part of the Pacific Ocean, releasing massive tension in the Earth's crust. ''That's it. No mystic injury to the Gaia spirit or anything.'' Online discussion can evolve toward truth, said Clay Shirky, an adjunct professor in the interactive telecommunications program at New York University and a blogger. One result is a process that can be more reliable than many new media, where corrections are often late and small, if they appear at all. Dr. Shirky said the key to reasonable discussion was to get beyond flames and the ''echo chamber'' effect of like-minded people simply reinforcing the opinions of one another and to let the self-correcting mechanisms do their job in a civil way. ''You hope the echo chamber effect and the fact-checking effect will balance out into a better and more nuanced set of narratives, and a more rigorously checked set of facts,'' he said. But in such a sharply contentious world, ''The risk is it will largely divide itself into competing narratives where what even constitutes a fact is different in different camps.'' To Xeni Jardin, an editor of BoingBoing.net, the ''self-healing'' quality of debate is one of the most important results of the electronic medium. ''When information that is provably untrue surfaces on the Net or surfaces in discussion groups, people want to be right -- they want to know the truth,'' she said. In her own blog, she said, ''Sometimes people spend really a long time researching background information on an item that we post'' and correct the record through comments. In the tsunami discussion on Democratic Underground, some participants continued to post farfetched theories about what caused the earthquake based on pseudoscience and conspiracy, and on Wizbang, the vituperation continued unabated, spreading even to many victims of the disaster. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: COMMUNICATIONS"
"The World Health Organization warned yesterday about the risk of dengue fever, malaria and other potentially fatal mosquito-borne diseases in countries struck by tsunamis on Dec. 26, particularly Indonesia. Rains are creating fresh breeding sites for mosquitoes in stagnant water, the agency said, so it is joining with the affected countries to spray insecticides, distribute tens of thousands of bed nets and diagnostic kits, and provide equipment and drugs. Dengue and malaria are endemic in all the countries hit by the tsunamis except Maldives. No specific drug therapy exists for dengue, a viral disease, and the parasite that causes malaria has developed resistance to some drugs. Anopheles sundaicus, one of the mosquitoes that transmit malaria, is of particular concern because it has spread disease before in Aceh, in northwestern Sumatra, said Dr. Allan Schapira, a W.H.O. malaria expert. This mosquito breeds in fresh water and brackish water, and pools of salt water from the tsunamis have been diluted by fresh water from rains, underground water and freshwater streams, the agency said. So far no outbreaks or significant increases in mosquito-borne diseases have been detected, but the case count could rise with more active monitoring, Dr. Schapira said. A. sundaicus bites both outdoors and indoors. Health officials say they do not know whether in the wake of the destruction, mosquitoes that usually live and bite outdoors will start biting indoors more often. ''Mosquitoes will find their blood source wherever they can find it,'' Dr. Schapira said in a telephone interview from the agency's headquarters in Geneva. As one step in monitoring mosquitoes, health officials are taking samples of the insects in the affected areas. The officials are also working with villagers to clean up mosquito breeding sites in debris around camps and homes in the affected areas. Indonesia experienced a major dengue outbreak last year, and this year cases have been reported in the capital, Jakarta. The disease, often called break-bone fever, can cause intense pain and heavy bleeding, which can be fatal. It is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which usually bites during the day."
"About 140,000 motorists play a game of seismic roulette here every day, slapping down a $3 toll in a bet that they will make it across the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and back before the earth shakes it to pieces. Damaged in an earthquake in 1989, the eastern span of the four-and-a-half-mile bridge was deemed unlikely to withstand another major jolt. More than 15 years later, a project to replace the patched-up section is mired in budget woes, political squabbling over its design and, most recently, assertions that some welders had cut corners. Officials from the Federal Highway Administration began inspecting the welds for defects this week, and the F.B.I. is investigating possible criminal wrongdoing. Experts warn that the danger persists of an earthquake inflicting even worse damage than the 1989 earthquake, which was centered in Loma Prieta, 60 miles south of here in the Santa Cruz Mountains. ''This has been a race against time from the get-go,'' said Steve Heminger, executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, the Bay Area transit agency. ''That fact seems to be all too often forgotten.'' In 2003, the United States Geological Survey estimated that there was a 62 percent probability of a major earthquake in the Bay Area within 30 years. The most recent projections by state officials say it will be at least seven years before the new span opens to traffic, and, if financing and design problems are not worked out soon, many more years beyond that. Though not as famous as the Golden Gate Bridge, to the north, the Bay Bridge is among the busiest in the nation, linking the San Francisco peninsula to the heavily populated mainland to the east. Almost immediately after its opening in 1936, the Bay Bridge was handling traffic that had not been expected for at least 15 years. State officials have estimated that 140,000 round trips are made on the bridge each day, with those heading west required to pay the toll. Like many people familiar with the risks a big quake poses, David P. Schwartz, an earthquake geologist with the Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., said he avoids crossing the bridge. ''We fully expect that the next major Bay Area earthquake will be in much closer than Loma Prieta and on one of the major urban faults,'' Dr. Schwartz said. ''If you happen to be crossing the Bay Bridge at the time of the next close-in Bay Area earthquake, and it hasn't been retrofitted, there is a very good likelihood there will be another major failure to it.'' But Mr. Heminger, who commutes by subway from his home in San Francisco to his office in Oakland, said public anxiety over the bogged-down project has not been what one might expect. ''I think part of it is that Californians live in denial about earthquakes,'' Mr. Heminger said. ''If we thought about them all the time, we would move to Montana.'' A spokeswoman for the California Department of Transportation, which owns the bridge and is overseeing construction of the new span, said the existing structure had been reinforced to withstand a moderate earthquake. Asked if it could survive more significant shaking, the spokeswoman, Lauren E. Wonder, said, ''That's why we are building this new structure.'' In the 1989 quake, a 50-foot-long section of the eastern span's upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck, killing a driver. The truss-and-cantilever eastern span, which runs two and a quarter miles from Yerba Buena Island to Oakland, is more vulnerable to earthquakes than is the western span, a suspension design that runs from the island to San Francisco. The western span was retrofitted, or strengthened, after 1989 and will not need to be replaced. Bruce A. Bolt, emeritus professor of seismology at the University of California, Berkeley, who serves on a state seismic advisory board, said the intention was to make the new span able to withstand an earthquake equivalent to the one in 1906, which was centered near San Francisco and ruptured nearly 300 miles of the San Andreas Fault. Scientists disagree on the magnitude of that quake, with estimates of 7.7 to 8.3. Dr. Bolt said he does not shy away from driving on the bridge but said he was alarmed at how long it was taking to complete the new span. He said his biggest concern was that the span might not be in place before a quake hits one of the Bay Area's two most worrisome faults, the San Andreas and the Hayward, which cuts beneath Oakland. The last big quake on the Hayward fault was in 1868, and many scientists believe it is due to fracture before the better known San Andreas. ''If you get another 1906-type earthquake, the bridge would fail in a way that people would be killed and the bridge would be out of use for a long time, maybe a year,'' Dr. Bolt said. ''The economy of this region depends on this bridge.'' After the 1989 quake, which registered a magnitude of 6.9, the California Department of Transportation identified 750 highway bridges and seven state-owned toll bridges that needed to be strengthened or replaced. Hundreds of bridges were added to the statewide inventory after an earthquake in 1994 in Northridge, a suburb of Los Angeles. A report last December by the state auditor said work had been completed on all but 18 of the 2,194 highway bridges selected for strengthening and all but two of the toll bridges. The remaining structures, it said, required ''more complex retrofit and replacement work.'' In the case of the Bay Bridge, however, Dr. Bolt and other experts said the seismic difficulties were worked out long ago. Since the mid-1990's, the biggest problem has been the politics of building one of California's largest public works, estimated to cost $6.2 billion. ''I never would have dreamt of such delays,'' said Dr. Bolt, who recounted a long list of political trip-ups over the years, including efforts by Willie L. Brown, the former San Francisco mayor, to have the new span realigned to preserve development opportunities on Yerba Buena Island, and Mayor Jerry Brown of Oakland wanting the most attractive segment of the new span moved closer to Oakland from San Francisco. At one point, the Navy, which owns part of Yerba Buena Island, refused to allow the new span to be anchored there and threatened to arrest state workers if they tried to drill test bores, Dr. Bolt recalled. The Navy said the span would ruin historic buildings and would create noise and vibration problems. The dispute was settled when officials in Washington intervened. Most of the bickering, though, has been about money. Hearings in Sacramento are scheduled next week on what will be the third round of legislation to pay for the project. Southern California lawmakers and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger want Bay Area drivers to pay for the work through higher tolls. Northern Californians say the bridge is state-owned and therefore the financial burden should be shared statewide. In a bid to save money in a tight budget, Mr. Schwarzenegger last year rejected plans to include a self-anchored suspension segment near Yerba Buena Island, an unusual feature selected by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and favored by Bay Area politicians for its elegance and distinctiveness. Mr. Schwarzenegger said the design was too costly, but studies have differed on whether reverting to a simpler elevated roadway would save money or cause more expensive delays. Legislation introduced this week in Sacramento would preserve the suspension design, while seeking a compromise on how to pay for it. Adding to the delays, some of the work on the new span's foundation has been halted so welds can be inspected. The contractor, KFM Joint Venture, and state transportation officials have denied assertions by some welders of substandard work, reported last week in The Oakland Tribune. -------------------- Earthquake Hits Southern California MARICOPA, Calif., April 16 (AP) -- A earthquake with a magnitude of 5.1 struck Southern California on Saturday and could be felt in downtown Los Angeles, about 85 miles southeast of the epicenter. Local officials said there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. The quake struck at 12:18 p.m. and was centered about 13 miles east of Maricopa and 25 miles south-southwest of Bakersfield, according to a preliminary report from the United States Geological Survey."
"WHEN THE MISSISSIPPI RAN BACKWARDS Empire, Intrigue, Murder, and the New Madrid Earthquakes. By Jay Feldman. Illustrated. 305 pp. The Free Press. $27. Kismet and coincidence drive ''When the Mississippi Ran Backwards,'' Jay Feldman's study of what may have been the biggest earthquakes ever to hit the United States. But the most striking accident of timing associated with the book is one Feldman could never have foreseen: as it was nearing publication, another monstrous earthquake brought a devastation to Asia that stunned the world. That juxtaposition makes Feldman's book more than just an interesting historical account. Against the exhaustive coverage of the recent earthquake and tsunami in the Indian Ocean, the attention paid to the seismic jolts in the Mississippi Valley in 1811 and 1812 seems like a news blackout. The earthquakes were powerful enough to alter the geography of the region but not powerful enough to make a lasting impression in the historical record; they have been largely forgotten. It's an odd sensation, reading Feldman's book, realizing the scope of what he's describing, seeing how relatively sparse the human evidence of it is today, then looking at our more recent tsunami frenzy, accompanied, as it was, by a dismaying scramble by television broadcasters for the best camcorder images. If a natural catastrophe happens in the forest and is not caught on home video, is it really catastrophic? By our usual measures -- lives and dollars -- the earthquakes that rattled the Midwest beginning on Dec. 16, 1811, were not calamitous, simply because there were relatively few people around to be killed and relatively few buildings around to be destroyed. But Feldman tries to make the case that they helped effect great change anyway, by influencing the course of the Indian wars, triggering a religious revival and even, in one bizarre instance, preventing a murder from going undiscovered. If he's not entirely successful in elevating the quakes to a historical magnitude that matches their physical magnitude, Feldman at least makes his attempt entertaining, weaving several disparate narratives together in the style of a ticktock thriller. The first quake struck in the wee hours, about 2 a.m., apparently centered near modern-day Blytheville, in the northeast corner of Arkansas. Feldman whets the appetite with a few snapshots of that moment in time: of a Creek village in present-day Alabama, where the great Shawnee chief Tecumseh had just threatened to ''stamp my foot on the ground and shake down every house'' if the Creeks did not join his Indian confederacy; of a household in western Kentucky where a vile man named Lilburne Lewis had just killed a slave and ordered other slaves to dismember the body and burn it. Then Feldman, who has written for magazines like Smithsonian and Newsweek, backs up in time and traces those and other threads up to the groundshaking moment. He tells of the founding of the riverbank settlement of New Madrid, in what is now southeastern Missouri, an entrepreneurial effort by a fellow named George Morgan who, Feldman writes, had no idea that one day ''temblors would take this paradisiacal setting and violently shake it, as a dog would a rat.'' In a particularly engaging segment he describes how Nicholas Roosevelt and his intrepid wife, Lydia, came to be piloting the West's first steamboat down the Mississippi that December. And he sketches the history of the New Madrid fault zone, the geological time bomb that went off that night in December and then continued to rumble into the following April, delivering two other major quakes (Jan. 23 and Feb. 7) and hundreds of lesser jolts. With only a few stories to tell, Feldman can afford to take his time, and he does; the book is more than half over before he gets back to the day of the first quake. It's an effective approach, a long lull setting up a big storm, highlighting how terrifying it must have been to the people of the day, many of them illiterate, none of them able to tune in radio or TV for an explanation. It surely seemed to many like the end of the world. ''It was so dark that we could see only when the pale, sickly flashes of lightning illuminated the scene,'' one man in New Madrid related. ''One of the flashes followed, or rather accompanied, the second shock, and by the aid of it I saw the people all prostrated on the ground.'' A man in a settlement called Little Prairie ''observed what had been a swamp suddenly lift up and become dry land,'' Feldman writes, and a woman about 10 miles from there walked out her front door that morning and found that a river now stood between her and her smokehouse. In Tennessee, a trapper watched a lake appear where none had been before. In some places, the ground rolled like ocean waves and seemed to liquefy. And yes, as the book's title says, boats on the Mississippi were thrown upriver by giant waves. The Dec. 16, Jan. 23 and Feb. 7 earthquakes, Feldman says, are believed to have been at least magnitude 7 on the modern scale, and the first and last may have reached 8.1 -- numbers that put them in a class with the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. (The Asian earthquake last December is now ranked at at least 9.) Feldman takes his various characters through the chaos deftly, devoting the most time to Tecumseh, whose threat to make the ground shake became the stuff of legend among Indians once the ground actually did shake. Oddly, though, it is here that Feldman is least convincing in arguing that the earthquakes played a significant role in events. His unflattering portraits of William Henry Harrison and other leaders make clear that the white encroachment Tecumseh was trying to resist had a grim inevitability more powerful than nature itself.

"Walking Underwater You've got to crawl before you can walk, but most octopuses never get past crawling. They flail some of their suckered arms in slow motion, pushing and pulling against rocks and other objects to move across the seafloor. Christine L. Huffard, a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, and colleagues have found two species of octopus that walk on two of their arms. They use the suckered edges like bulldozer treads, laying them down in alternating fashion to scoot along. Both species walk backward using their two backmost arms, the researchers report in the journal Science. Octopus marginatus, which is found in Indonesia, contacts the bottom with roughly half of each arm, while O. aculeatus, which is found from Indonesia to Australia, uses closer to three-quarters. Ms. Huffard measured the speed of O. marginatus at about 2.5 to 5.5 inches per second, slightly faster than crawling. Walking on two limbs generally requires bones and muscles: something to keep the limbs rigid and something else to move them. Octopuses have lots of muscles, and make up for the lack of bones by keeping their arms filled with fluid to provide support. As to why these two creatures walk this way, the answer seems to be that they sometimes need to maintain their camouflage. To disguise itself from predators, O. marginatus wraps its arms around its head, looking, to the human eye, like a coconut. If it needs to move suddenly, it can maintain the disguise with six arms. Similarly, O. aculeatus can walk away from danger, six of its arms raised so that it resembles a bunch of algae. Video of the octopus can be seen at www.nytimes.com/science. Images of Creep In the world of materials science, creep, or the gradual deformation of material under a constant load, is the equivalent of slow death. In metals, it occurs as the texture of the metal grains changes and cavities form and grow. Creep can be a serious problem in industry -- in power plants, for instance, it can severely limit the lifetime of components that operate at high temperatures. But creep can be hard to detect. The effects are so gradual that they may not be noticed until it's too late, when the material fails quickly. Creep is usually studied by cutting a sample of a material and looking at the damage under a microscope. Then models are developed to estimate how long a particular material will last under certain conditions. But microscopy offers only a snapshot in time, and a two-dimensional one at that. Now a team of Austrian, German and French scientists has devised a way to measure creep that doesn't require cutting a sample up. The technique, reported in Science, combines fast-tomography imaging with diffraction analysis of crystalline structures, to let scientists see creep in three dimensions over time, as the cavities evolve. The researchers studied a common brass alloy at a synchrotron in Grenoble, France. Radiation from the synchrotron was the source for both the tomographic imaging and the diffraction analysis (which provides complementary data about characteristics like crystal orientation and internal strain). Like other tomographic techniques, the method produces virtual ''slices'' of the material, showing the growth of the cavities over time. l The technique should help researchers further refine their models of creep in any number of metals. Quake Power The Dec. 26 earthquake that brought on the Indian Ocean tsunami was more than twice as powerful as previously estimated, new calculations show. The calculations, reported in Nature by scientists at Northwestern University, make the quake the second strongest ever recorded, exceeded only by one in Chile in 1960. In a second Nature paper, scientists from the California Institute of Technology and the University of Science and Technology of China show that the fault ruptured along more than 700 miles, about twice as long as previously thought. Hey, Your Kite's Got Dandruff Dr. Ruprecht Jaenicke, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Mainz in Germany, has a bone to pick with atmospheric chemists. ''If chemists analyze atmospheric aerosols,'' he said, referring to the tiny suspended particles that affect the earth's climate, ''they usually account for only 60 percent.'' Wind-borne dust from deserts and salt from the oceans make up a large part, along with soot, sulfates and organic compounds converted from gas. ''And that's about it,'' Dr. Jaenicke said. ''Forty percent are more or less unknown. And they live with that. They are content with that.'' Not so Dr. Jaenicke, who has spent much of the past 15 years collecting air samples around the world and analyzing them. His conclusion, reported in the journal Science, is that a large proportion of aerosols -- up to 25 percent in some areas -- consists of cellular and protein particles. In other words, bits of animal fur, pet dander, ground up insects and dead plant material, even dandruff. ''If you take off your pullover, then a lot of this material is put into the air,'' Dr. Jaenicke said. ''I'm talking about what you'd call dead cellular material.'' More active biological particles like pollen and mold spores make up only a very small fraction of aerosols, he said. Dr. Jaenicke said it should not be surprising that a lot of this material is in the atmosphere. ''Two-thirds of the continents are biosphere,'' he said, rich with living things that flake, scratch, rub, grind, die and otherwise produce dead material. ''Only one-third is desert. We have a large area as a source for these particles.'' They could affect climate in two ways, he added. For one thing, a lot of these materials take up water. So they act as tiny water droplets, and could influence the formation of clouds. Other particles may act as nuclei for ice formation in the atmosphere, leading to more precipitation. ''Nobody knows, really, what the impact might be,'' Dr. Jaenicke said. The important thing is that atmospheric scientists recognize that these kinds of particles are important. ''They need to take it seriously,'' he said. ''It's like if you have a certain amount of money in your pocket, and 40 percent of it you don't know where it comes from and where it goes -- you'd feel a little insecure in your life, wouldn't you?''

"A pair of trucks rumbled along the broken roads of Kashmir on Tuesday, carrying yet another load of food, clothes and makeshift tents into the earthquake zone. But unlike so many of the anonymous donors thousands of miles away, the source of this aid, a mosque, was boldly advertised on the trucks' red-lettered banners: ''Masjid Al-Noor, Staten Island, New York.'' ''We had great difficulty spelling Staten Island on the phone,'' said Suhail Muzaffar, 53, a stately former professor and Pakistani immigrant who is chairman of the mosque's board of trustees, and runs a thriving export company on Staten Island. Mr. Muzaffar's point was not pride but control. He wrote up a shopping list based on cellphone calls from victims trapped in the mountains to relatives who worship at his mosque. He rented the trucks and ordered the banners himself, through connections in his family's Pakistani hometown, Rawalpindi. And he enlisted a Pakistani charity he knew to carry the order through. Only in this way, he said, could he and other members of his mosque feel sure that their $12,000 in hard-earned donations would reach the people they were trying to help. Relief experts say the mosque's control of its beneficence illustrates a new trend in global charity: many donors are no longer content to write checks and hope for the best. Fears of inept government bureaucracies, official corruption, and charities that engage in fraud have led to an increasingly hands-on approach by donors, from the lone cabdriver to the boards of many foundations. The shift is especially notable among prosperous immigrants, whose ties to their homelands enable them to give back directly, circumventing the traditional routes of charity. ''What you're talking about is a new kind of virtual philanthropy,'' said Kathleen McCarthy, director of the Center on Philanthropy at the City College of New York's Graduate Center. ''They're not just giving it blindly but through cellphones and things like that they're able to watch in a way that earlier waves of immigrants couldn't.'' Whether the donors are struggling immigrants or established philanthropists, a push for greater accountability and efficiency in the distribution of charity is growing. Nearly 90 percent of donations to the American Red Cross in response to Hurricane Katrina were designated strictly for Katrina rather than for the Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund, a clear rise in directed giving, said Kara Bunte, a spokeswoman. The public's distrust grew markedly after Sept.11, when organizations like the American Red Cross were criticized for reserving some donations for uses other than direct aid. ''What were once open pledges of financial support now come with strings and expectations and caveats,'' said Gerald Martone, the director of humanitarian affairs for the International Rescue Committee; the caveats, he added, include requests for recognition akin to the truck banners identifying the mosque in Staten Island. ''I've heard people describe disasters as looking like a Nascar race with all the various logos and insignias of donors.'' The congregation on Staten Island is not alone in steering relief work in Pakistan from New York City. Irfan Khursheed has actively directed, by telephone from his office in Jamaica, Queens, how the $500,000 in donations raised by the Islamic Circle of North America Relief will be distributed in Pakistan. Mr. Khursheed, the group's executive director, approved 1,000 tents, 5,000 blankets and $50,000 for three field hospitals for Kashmir, where he is from, he said. So numerous were the calls to the New York office of Pakistan International Airlines from immigrants hoping to help, that the company approved a policy for the free delivery of charitable goods to earthquake victims. Moe Razvi, director of the Council of People's Organizations in Brooklyn, was delighted: donated goods he collected for tsunami victims took weeks to arrive in Indonesia. Mr. Razvi plans to ship 300 bags of clothes on Pakistan International Airlines on Saturday. When the earthquake hit in Pakistan, Rashed Jafri was driving a limousine through the streets of Queens, at the end of his shift. Soon after, a fellow driver called his cellphone with the news, sending him racing to a friend's house to watch a Pakistani news channel. Within hours, Mr. Jafri, 40, was exchanging calls with his relatives in Bagh, a small village high above Muzaffarab, the capital of Kashmir on the Pakistani side of the disputed border. While an obstacle to aid workers, the village's high altitude made for a clear cellphone connection. ''They were digging people up with their own hands,'' said Mr. Jafri, who lost an aunt in the earthquake. Calls like these radiated throughout the city's Pakistani community. A friend of Mr. Jafri's told Mr. Muzaffar of the calls from desperate villagers in Bagh. There was also footage beamed by satellite from Geo TV, a Pakistani television channel, showing the Bagh victims stranded in the rain, without food or tents. Mr. Muzaffar thought his mosque would have the most immediate impact by sending help directly to Bagh. For that he needed a conduit in Pakistan, and chose Minhaj-ul-Quran, a local charity with a solid reputation, he said. ''What is the driving distance between the base camp and Bagh?'' Mr. Muzaffar asked Dawood Hussain, a director of the charity who was posted in a town near Islamabad. ''How much trucking time is involved?'' ''It really depends,'' Mr. Hussain answered before launching into a grim report of road conditions. Mr. Muzaffar's office, a stone-facade town house on Travis Avenue on Staten Island, has become a makeshift command post in the days since the earthquake. One of three white clocks on the wall is set to Pakistan time. Mr. Muzaffar juggles three telephone lines and a cellphone, fielding calls from relatives in Pakistan, would-be donors and merchants in Islamabad. Aspects of the operation are almost surreal: Mr. Muzaffar ordered the banners for the trucks so that television crews could capture images of their arrival in Bagh -- proof that he hoped would be beamed back to the source of the aid, the homes of Pakistani immigrants in New York. ''We know the owners of the stations,'' he said, and asked them to film the trucks' arrival. The plan has not yet worked perfectly, mostly because the trucks have yet to reach Bagh. Mr. Hussain, who has been monitoring them, told Mr. Muzaffar that they had been stopped at least six times in villages en route and emptied by people desperate for supplies. Still, Mr. Muzaffar is hopeful. ''We want to get involved until we know that the people we wanted to serve have received the services we wanted to provide,'' he said."
"From the valley of death, they pointed to the far reaches of desperation. Over there in the village of Gunela, said Mushtaq Ahmed, pointing to hills under a mass of clouds, it is very cold, and there is nothing more than a bit of corn to eat. In a village called Khesarash, said Abdul Wahid, who had walked from there, children have died for lack of food. From across the river came Imdad ul-Haq Mian, bearing on his shoulders a frail old man with a broken arm. With the road still blocked by a landslide, Mr. Mian and his kinfolk had trekked six hours through the hills, across loose, slip-sliding rocks, to bring the wounded from Dabriyan to a makeshift clinic here. Balakot was once a pretty little village on the eastern edge of North-West Frontier Province, nestled in a green valley next to a gurgling river. Today it is a putrid, enraged, aggrieved place. All the houses have fallen in on themselves. Tents have arrived, but they are so scarce that one man said his was occupied by five families on Tuesday night. The suffering has made people lose their minds, one man said. The townspeople were fighting amongst themselves for the meager aid that had arrived, he said. The military estimates that about 4,000 have died in this province, the majority of them here and in a nearby town called Garhi Habibullah. With no relief going to the villages in the hills nearby, Balakot has become the place where there is at least some hope of getting food, first aid and, for the most seriously wounded, the chance to be airlifted out. On Wednesday, five days after the 7.6 magnitude earthquake, improved weather and the arrival of 10 more helicopters increased the flow of aid into northern Pakistan, but United Nations officials estimated that a million people remained homeless, hungry and threatened by disease in hundreds of shattered mountain hamlets. Pakistan's prime minister, Shaukat Aziz, said Wednesday that the death toll had climbed to 25,000, up from 23,000 the day before. In India, 1,300 are said to have died. Journeying for miles on foot, desperate survivors from high-altitude villages streamed into major towns where Pakistani, American, Afghan and United Nations helicopters landed on makeshift helipads to evacuate the injured. All told, there were 40 helicopters on duty Wednesday, but with more than 52,000 injured, they appeared to come nowhere near meeting the need for evacuations. In the aftermath of the earthquake, the relief and rescue operations presented a crucial test for Pakistan's most powerful institution: the army. In the pecking order of misery, Balakot is comparatively lucky. The villages beyond it are not. ''No one has come to us,'' Mr. Mian said. There are still no tents in his village. No food or medicines have been sent. For the first three days, he said, people hardly ate, until the dead, and their provisions, could be recovered from the rubble. On Wednesday, blankets were dropped from the sky over Mr. Mian's village, but there were not enough for the survivors. Only after burying the dead (22 in his extended family alone) did he and his kinfolk have the time to ferry the wounded here. A man named Jahanzeb said he had walked for a whole day to reach Balakot from Sangar; at least 50 people, he said, were badly injured there and unable to travel. He knew of four who had died of their injuries, after being pulled from the rubble. The villagers built a makeshift helicopter pad on Monday, he said, but the army had not yet arrived. Jehangir Khan, an old man with a white beard, said he had carried his injured daughter, Saira, down from their village, Bhumara, on a stretcher and waited three days to get her on a helicopter. On Wednesday, Saira, a slight girl of perhaps 15 -- she did not know her age -- lay on a stretcher under cotton quilts. Her leg was broken, she was bleeding and she felt pain in her abdomen, she said. By day's end, she was loaded onto an American Chinook helicopter along with 28 of the most seriously wounded here. Her brother, also injured, was not allowed on. Her sister, Zaheda, had died in the quake. In Islamabad, Mr. Aziz said Wednesday that Pakistan had received $350 million in aid pledges from foreign countries, and 20,000 Pakistani troops were fanning out across the affected region, but rescue teams had still not reached hundreds of villages. ''We accept the fact that all areas of the quake affected region have not been accessed yet,'' he said. ''It's a slow process.'' On a visit to Pakistan on Wednesday, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the United States would send more helicopters, a field hospital and an engineering unit to help the rescue and reconstruction effort. She promised that the United States would aid Pakistan as it tried to reconstruct an entire region. ''We will be with you in your hour of need,'' she said. Aid even came from India, Pakistan's rival in the region. But the Indian effort was not without a hitch, as a plane from New Delhi was forced to turn around within 10 minutes of takeoff because Pakistan had said there was no room to land at the airport near Islamabad. The plane later landed with 25 tons of supplies. The rivalries between New Delhi and Islamabad aside, the victims of the quake in both countries had similarly chilling stories. One man, Mureed Hussain, 25, was buried under the rubble for five days before being pulled out by villagers in Chappar, on the Indian-held side of Kashmir, the Himalayan region at the center of a longstanding territorial dispute between Pakistan and India. On Wednesday, with a broken hip and a broken leg, Mr. Hussain was carried on a coat by four fellow villagers over a mile from his village to the nearest road. No government or private aid agencies had yet managed to reach the village. The wait for aid has been equally long in India, and the suffering equally intense. In Kamal Kote, one of the hardest-hit Indian areas, aid finally trickled in on Tuesday, the fourth day after the earthquake. Muhammad Sayeed lost eight members of his extended family when the quake flattened his house there. The first night, his family spent the night in the open and ate nothing. On Day 2, they could rustle up tea and muddy bread. On Day 4, for the first time, they had a hot meal of rice and vegetables. On Day 5, there was still nowhere to bathe or brush their teeth, and Mr. Sayeed clutched a handful of pain killers from the local pharmacy. He was not feeling charitable toward his government. ''My body is cracking now,'' he said. ''I am at the breaking point. The politicians come and give empty promises. They make tall promises and deliver nothing.'' On the other side of despair, in Balakot, eight men had trekked down from the hills at sundown, hoping to find some food to take back to their families. By the time they arrived, bedraggled and beside themselves with hunger, there was nothing more to be had in Balakot. They would go back up to the hills empty-handed, they said, and sleep out in the cold once more. Correction: October 14, 2005, Friday A front-page article yesterday about conditions in northern Pakistan after the Oct. 8 earthquake misstated and misattributed an official estimate of deaths in the country's North-West Frontier Province, where the devastation was particularly severe. The figure -- from the provincial government, not the military -- was nearly 10,000, not about 4,000."
"Among the American Chinooks and Black Hawks and Pakistani helicopters ferrying food and water and tents in and wounded people out of this stricken town, one of the worst hit in the earthquake zone, are four helicopters bearing the Afghan flag. The Russian-built MI-17 helicopters -- almost the entire operational Afghan air force -- have been sent to help quake victims in Pakistan. ''They are our neighbors, our brothers, our fellow Muslims, and we want to help,'' said the Afghan team leader, Brig. Gen. Muhammad Barat, a Soviet-trained pilot with 30 years' flying experience. The Afghans are under the operational control of the American military in Pakistan but have come in under their own flag after President Hamid Karzai offered their services to the Pakistani president, Gen. Pervez Musharaff, two days ago and his offer was accepted. The Afghans are still building their army, and the air force is just a fledgling organization, but the Afghan government still has half a dozen helicopters in good condition left over from the Soviet era. The best four, now in Pakistan, date from the late 1980's and were part of the last consignment supplied by the Soviets to the Afghan government of Najibullah, according to a military spokesman, Gen. Zaher Azimi. Pakistan has appealed to governments for more helicopters to help reach the remote mountain villages, many of which are cut off by blocked roads. In these areas, thousands of wounded are waiting to be evacuated and other victims are without food and shelter. Afghan helicopters flew 16 missions Wednesday, taking in medical supplies, tents and food, and were nearly swamped in Balakot by crowds desperate to reach the aid, General Barat said. ''We had to hover and just drop things, people swarmed around us so much,'' he said. ''One man climbed on and we had to touch down elsewhere and throw him off.'' ''I was very sad and depressed today to see it,'' he added. ''People are living out in the open and are desperate.''"
"Calamities of nature do not just test the capacity of a state. They can also offer unexpected opportunities for political craftsmanship. Take India. The government has announced that it needs no international aid to recover from the Oct. 8 earthquake that leveled villages in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, killed an estimated 1,300 people there and displaced roughly 30,000 families. As temperatures fall to near freezing in the hilltop hamlets of Kashmir, the most liberal estimates suggest that fewer than half of the surviving families have tents to sleep in. Yet a full nine days and nights after the quake, Indian officials say they have no need for the United Nations, nor foreign aid agencies, to bring tents from abroad. Indian officials say that they are able to care for their own, and that tents are coming from private producers and the Indian military. What is more, India has sent aid, including 620 tents, to its neighbor and archrival, Pakistan. ''We ourselves are taking care of our victims,'' said Navtej Sarna, the Foreign Ministry spokesman. ''When there are offers by friendly countries and anything is needed, these offers are considered.'' It is too early to tell whether India, which seeks a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, can go it alone. Certainly there is anger in Indian-administered Kashmir among people who have been forced to build their own tents out of the wooden beams and tin sheets retrieved from the rubble of their homes. Even so, India's posture says a great deal about the politics of disaster aid, and about India's own ambitions to assert itself as a world power. India also refused international aid in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami, though it later allowed United Nations and private agencies to help. Three years ago, it rebuffed development aid from a number of foreign donors, saying it was no longer necessary. In short, India has been anxious to portray itself as a giver, rather than a receiver. ''What we can manage on our own, we do,'' said Hamid Ansari, a retired Indian diplomat. ''There's a certain sense of self-confidence that we can manage it and, let me say, a desire to signal that you are capable of managing things on your own.'' Pratap Bhanu Mehta, the director of a private research group here called the Center for Policy Research, saw reflected in India's rejection of foreign aid so far a desire to be seen as an emerging global power, or one of what he called ''the big boys.'' ''The risk really is that in our refusal to accept aid I don't think we are keeping people to whom aid might go as central,'' Mr. Mehta said. ''We are playing politics with aid, using aid to make a statement.'' Pakistan's approach has been exactly the opposite. Hit a whole lot harder by the Oct. 8 quake -- its official death toll stood at 42,000 on Tuesday-- Pakistan has appealed for worldwide help and allowed foreigners to travel to its side of Kashmir and to the traditionally well-guarded pockets of North-West Frontier Province, the two areas that suffered the greatest damage. Pakistan is the world's largest manufacturer of tents, but still cannot produce nearly enough. The United Nations said Tuesday that 350,000 additional tents were urgently needed and that 500,000 earthquake survivors had still not received any medical care, food or other assistance. There is no agreement on whether India has sufficient tents to care for its own. The Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Indian Army would be able to help make up the shortfall. The army spokesman in Kashmir, Lt. Col. S.K. Batra, cautioned that the military, itself badly hit in the earthquake, could not entirely deplete its own stock. The government's joint secretary of disaster management, Aseem Khurana, vowed that enough tents would be sent within a week. So far, roughly 13,000 of the 30,000 tents required have been distributed, he said, slightly less than half sent by the Indian Army. State government officials in Kashmir said they were puzzled about the dearth of tents. ''It is really eye-opening for us, that in this country with such a large population base, more than a million-strong army, and so many paramilitary forces we just do not have enough tents,'' said Muzaffar Baig, the Kashmir state finance and planning minister. ''Every day we are getting only 300 to 400 tents from the central government.'' R.K. Pachauri, director of the Energy Research Institute in Delhi, a private research group, insisted that if India had enough tents, they should have been distributed much more quickly. If it did not, it should have accepted them from overseas right away. ''We should really have been able to organize ourselves a little better,'' he said. That the quake struck the province of Jammu and Kashmir, which has been at the center of a long territorial dispute between India and Pakistan, makes the politics of aid particularly prickly. The Indian government has never been keen on outside intervention in Kashmir, so the subject of foreign aid to the quake victims is a touchy matter. ''New Delhi has adopted an enlightened approach to helping Pakistan during this tragedy, and a backward approach to accepting foreign humanitarian assistance on its side of the Kashmir divide,'' said Michael Krepon, president of the Washington-based Henry L. Stimson Center, which studies security issues. ''Part of this has to do with national pride, which is compounded by sensitivity to foreign governments making landfall in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.'' Kashmiri leaders have pressed New Delhi to embrace international aid as a humanitarian gesture. ''Allow international organizations to come in and help the Kashmiri people,'' said Yasin Malik, leader of a separatist group called Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front. ''India will gain. They will not lose with this kind of gesture.'' In the back and forth between India and Pakistan, neighborly solidarity is difficult to distinguish from political gamesmanship. On Monday, Pakistan accepted India's longstanding offer of helicopters to help with relief work, but said it would not take Indian military pilots or crews. On Tuesday afternoon, India announced that it would open a number of telephone lines to enable Kashmiris in its territory to communicate with their relatives on the Pakistani side. By Tuesday evening, the Pakistani president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, called on India to allow Kashmiris to cross the disputed Line of Control to assist in relief efforts. Later in the evening, India said it welcomed General Musharraf's suggestion. ''This is in line with India's advocacy of greater movement across the line for relief work and closer people-to-people contacts,'' a Foreign Ministry statement said. ''India is willing to facilitate such movements, but we await word from Pakistan about the practical details of implementing this intention.'' LETTER FROM ASIA Correction: October 22, 2005, Saturday A Letter From Asia article on Wednesday about political implications of India's decision against seeking foreign help for its earthquake victims misstated the title of Michael Krepon, who discussed the issue. He is president emeritus of the Henry L. Stimson Center; the current president is Ellen Laipson."
"United Nations and private aid workers said Thursday that the pressing need to shelter up to three million Pakistani earthquake survivors before the harsh Himalayan winter sets in was threatening to become the most difficult relief operation the world has ever faced. Compounding the problems posed by the sheer number of people displaced -- three times as many as those affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami last December -- are the mountainous terrain and the onset of a winter that is likely to arrive in less than three weeks and sever the stricken mountain hamlets of the north from the rest of the country until spring. And yet, perhaps out of fatigue after a year of seemingly endless natural disasters, aid officials say, the international response has been weak. Even in the face of the epic destruction, foreign donors have so far pledged less than $90 million, or barely a quarter of the $312 million that the United Nations estimates it will need for immediate relief. ''It's the most difficult humanitarian crisis ever,'' said Andrew Macleod, chief operations officer in the United Nations Emergency Coordination Center in Islamabad, ''because the scale is huge, the logistics are so difficult and there's such a brutal winter coming on.'' In recent days as his office assessed the damage across the far-flung hamlets dotting the Himalayas, the most credible estimates turned out to be ''the worst-case scenarios,'' Mr. Macleod said. ''We have never seen anything like this,'' he added. The quake struck an isolated, mountainous area of about 11,000 square miles, roughly the size of Maryland. The death toll has risen to 49,700, Pakistan's disaster response chief, Maj. Gen. Farooq Javed, said Thursday. The injured were tallied at 74,000. The earthquake struck portions of North-West Frontier Province and the Pakistani-controlled section of Kashmir. Another 1,300 people were killed and 30,000 families left homeless in the neighboring Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir. India this week opened up phone lines for families on its side to communicate with friends and relatives on the Pakistani side. At a news conference on Tuesday night, Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, suggested that the Line of Control that divides the Pakistani and Indian parts of Kashmir be opened as well. India, which has sent three consignments of quake relief to Pakistan, has welcomed the proposal in principle but has said it awaits details of how it would work. The spokeswoman for the Pakistani Foreign Office, Tasnim Aslam, said Thursday evening that discussions about logistics were under way within her government. Getting a handle on the scope of the crisis and deciding how to respond are extremely difficult. It is next to impossible to count the number of hamlets and homes scattered in the hills, and no accurate population count exists. Of the few roads that cross the hills and valleys, many have been cut off, and the continuing aftershocks prompt landslides that block them all over again. The people who live in the hills are unable or unwilling to abandon their land and go down to the lowlands, where aid is available. Even with helicopters from abroad, there are fewer than 80 working helicopters in the country as of Thursday, 12 days after the earthquake. United Nations officials say they need many more. In perhaps the starkest statement of need, there are not enough cold-weather tents in the world to house what the International Organization for Migration estimates to be up to 550,000 families left homeless by the quake. The snow will surely come before enough can be made. How many people will have to survive the winter without shelter is unclear. United Nations officials could estimate only that it would be in the tens of thousands. ''I think there is a requirement for the world community to realize the enormity of the challenge we are facing because of the nature of the terrain and the devastation,'' General Javed said in an interview here. Raphael Sindaye, South Asia relief coordinator for Oxfam, the international aid group, described his own predicament. The day after the quake, he resolved to order 60,000 tents, to house about 300,000 people. Then he looked at the availability of tents: it would be four months, deep into winter, before all of those tents could arrive. On Thursday, he said, he reduced his tent order by half. If aid groups like his are all forced to reduce their tent orders, where, he wondered aloud, will the rest of the homeless go? ''I'm really afraid the international community will not be able to cope with the disaster,'' he said, ''simply because we can't reach people.'' He said he was now planning to ask survivors what they could use to build their own shelters. ''I'm hoping people out there will tell us, 'If we get this, this and this, we'll be able to do this, this and this' and survive,'' he said. ''I can't imagine what that would be.'' Destruction does not always inspire generosity. To stave off starvation in Niger, the United Nations asked for $81 million but secured commitments of under $43 million. By contrast, according to the United Nations, the emergency appeal for the December tsunami was more than 80 percent financed within 10 days of the disaster. To help Pakistan, foreign donors have so far pledged $86 million of the $312 million needed, or 28 percent. ''This is not enough,'' the top relief envoy of United Nations, Jan Egeland, said at a news conference in Geneva on Thursday morning. ''We have never had this kind of logistical nightmare ever. We thought that the tsunami was as bad as it could get. This is worse.'' The tsunami, though it killed four times as many people, displaced only a third as many as the quake in Pakistan did, and the delivery of aid was far simpler on flat terrain close to the sea. The number of homeless here dwarfs even the two million displaced by the strife in the Darfur region of Sudan. The Persian Gulf war of 1991 turned 1.5 million Iraqi Kurds into refugees in a matter of days. The International Organization for Migration, which is in charge of setting up camps for the displaced, estimates that 62,000 tents have been sent to the affected areas. No one is willing to say how many people will have to do without tents by the time the snow comes. Aid workers are ferrying everything from tarps to corrugated tin to hammers and nails to help people cobble together something from the rubble of their houses. NATO planes began flying in 900 tons of aid on Thursday. Aid was most likely to reach those who could make their way to the lowlands or to roads open to relief convoys. Several camps were being set up for those willing to move in. ''You've got Darwin's fittest coming down and moving into tents,'' said a Unicef spokesman here, Katey Grusovin. ''But you've got children, you've got elderly still remaining very high up.'' Helicopters, mule trains and Pakistani soldiers continued to take relief to the upper hamlets on Thursday. Day by day, as the cold deepens, the relief window closes further. ''What they have on 1 December is what they have all winter,'' said Mr. Macleod, of the United Nations Emergency Coordination Center.

"All across America, Muslim charities, many of which have shunned the spotlight since 9/11 lest they attract unwanted law enforcement attention, are now stepping up their efforts to raise money for the victims of the earthquake that crumbled the northernmost corner of Pakistan. In many cases, they have been more successful than their mainstream charitable counterparts, many of which have said that donors are not responding to their appeals for contributions for Pakistan. Islamic Relief, one of the largest Muslim charities in the United States, had raised almost $1 million online alone through Wednesday, or about 10 times the amount raised by Save the Children. Other organizations reported similar success. ''Donors are responding really well,'' said Arif Shaikh, a spokesman for Islamic Relief. ''A lot of mosques have been collecting money on our behalf, and our phones have been ringing off the hooks with people wanting to make contributions.'' Mohammed Alomari, deputy director of programs at Life for Relief and Development, a Michigan-based nonprofit organization founded by Iraqi Americans after the 1991 Persian Gulf war, said donations from individuals and other non-Islamic organizations have been ''pretty good, considering all the other emergencies we've had this year.'' After the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, the F.B.I. cracked down on several Muslim charities in the United States, contending that they served as financial conduits for terrorist operations. The Justice Department froze the assets of several Muslim organizations, and at least two prominent Muslim donors who contributed to those organizations were arrested. Those actions caused great bitterness and wariness about giving among Muslims, whose leaders often note that the government has not publicly provided evidence for its suspicions. Most of the donations Life for Relief and Development has received for Pakistan so far have come in the form of goods like tents, blankets and medical supplies, which is one way for donors to ensure their contributions do not end up underwriting bombs or buying guns. ''Donors may have those kinds of concern in other instances, but I don't think that's the case in this instance,'' Mr. Alomari said. ''Given how many people have been asked to give for other disasters this year -- the tsunami, the famine in Mali and Niger, Hurricane Katrina and Rita -- it may just be easier right now to donate items.'' Several factors beyond religious solidarity are helping to propel the donations from the Muslim community, officials of the charities say. For one, the earthquake struck during the holy month of Ramadan, one of the two biggest giving periods on the Muslim calendar and a traditional time for thinking of the poor. Beyond that, many of the Muslim nonprofit groups here have established operations in Pakistan and thus are logical candidates for charity. Islamic Relief, for instance, has more than 100 staff members in Pakistan, and Life operates programs there ranging from water purification to rebuilding schools. Both organizations worked in Southeast Asia after the tsunami and in the Gulf Coast area after Katrina. The enormousness of the disaster in Pakistan, too, has overcome the fears of Muslim donors that their contributions might be considered financing for terrorist organizations by the American government. ''I think the sheer scale of the suffering we're seeing is prompting people to put aside whatever caution they might have had since 9/11 and dig deep to do whatever they can,'' said Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. The passage of time has also helped. ''Sure, there are still concerns among Muslims about donating, but the situation is much better than it used to be even a year ago,'' said Faiz Rehman, president of the National Council of Pakistani Americans. ''There's more confidence and more comfort within the community because people have seen that whatever happened to Muslim charities after 9/11, there are still a lot of Muslim charities around and they take that as proof that everything is in order.'' Charitable giving is an obligation for observant Muslims, and while Muslims can meet that obligation by giving to secular organizations, many prefer to give to Islamic groups, just as many Christians and Jews prefer to give to charities affiliated with their religions. A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, which has listed 41 charities abroad that it says are fund-raising fronts for terrorist organizations, said it had issued nothing new in anticipation of charitable giving for the earthquake. The government has made no official statement on the potential for charity aimed at Pakistani earthquake victims falling into the wrong hands. But the State Department has recommended that donors give to the American Red Cross, which has little direct involvement in relief operations in the affected region, or its international counterpart, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent societies. The United Nations Foundation also has created a South Asia Earthquake Response Fund, and President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan has started a similar, officially approved charity for earthquake victims. Correction: October 15, 2005, Saturday An article yesterday about efforts by Muslim charities to raise money for victims of the Oct. 8 earthquake in Pakistan and India misidentified the federal department that froze the assets of several Muslim charities after the 9/11 attacks on the ground that they were conduits for terrorist operations. It was the Department of the Treasury, not Justice. The article also referred imprecisely to the 41 charities listed as fronts for terrorist organizations. While all have offices abroad, three are based in the United States."
"Nadish Liaqat, 10, was pulled from the rubble of her collapsed school on Saturday. Since then, as the death toll in her mountain town has grown into the thousands, Nadish has stared at her mother, waved her left hand and cried. ''She would weep a lot, but there was no voice,'' said Naseem Akhtar, the girl's mother. ''There were tears and tears and tears.'' Nadish could whisper, a little, and told her mother that she felt excruciating pain in her neck and could not move her legs or her right arm. Unable to find treatment, or even pain killers, Ms. Akhtar tried to get Nadish out on a helicopter. On Thursday, an American military helicopter finally took them from their town, Bagh, to Islamabad, ending one form of anguish and beginning another. Doctors at the Rawalpindi General Hospital, near the Pakistani capital, said she was paralyzed. They said her rescuers might have worsened her spinal injuries; likewise her two trips to a local hospital on a blanket. The delay in getting her to a major hospital, they added, meant she had missed an opportunity for surgery that might have eased her paralysis. Pakistani doctors warned Thursday that the slow pace of evacuations after an earthquake devastated the region on Saturday could be costing the injured mobility, limbs or lives, and a United Nations official called for the fleet of roughly 50 helicopters involved in mountain evacuations to be tripled in size. The quake, measured at a magnitude of 7.6, shattered many mountain towns like Bagh, and evacuations have been slow, arduous affairs. Pakistani officials said Thursday that 6,000 of the estimated 52,000 injured people had been evacuated. The death toll in Pakistan stood at 25,000, but officials said they still expected it to rise as reports filtered through. In India, 1,300 are said to have died, and there have been similar complaints about delays in the rescue efforts there. [On Friday, Pakistan called off its search for survivors to concentrate on recovering bodies, The Associated Press reported. Maj. Farooq Nasir, an army spokesman, said the chances of finding survivors were ''very slim.''] In New York, Hansjoerg Strohmeyer, a senior United Nations envoy for relief efforts, called for a tripling of helicopter donations. ''We need a major stepping up of air assets in a dramatic sense,'' Mr. Strohmeyer told The A.P. ''We need those who can provide 5 or 10 helicopters at a time rather than those who can bring in one here and one there.'' After taking a helicopter tour of the devastated Kashmir region, Jan Egeland, the United Nations relief coordinator, also called for an immediate surge in aid. ''This is a desperate situation,'' he told Agence France-Presse. ''We're still racing against the clock and we need to get more helicopters, more water, more tents and more money.'' At Rawalpindi General Hospital, doctors said slow evacuations have denied about 20 of their patients, many of them children, the opportunity to undergo immediate surgery for spinal injuries that might reduce their paralysis. ''The people that are coming today after five days, there is no hope of saving their limbs,'' said Dr. Atta Ul Haque. ''They will remain paraplegic for their lives.'' Gangrene- damaged limbs of at least 10 people evacuated to Islamabad in the last 24 hours have been amputated, and doctors feared many more were likely. ''Gangrene has started coming,'' said Dr. Shehzad Rehan, a senior administrator at the hospital. ''I am expecting more.'' Four Swiss helicopters arrived in Pakistan on Thursday, to join those from Pakistan's own military, the United States, Germany and Afghanistan, but injured people arriving from stricken villages reported that hundreds of other victims had been left behind. The number of helicopters involved in the relief effort has increased gradually, from roughly 40 on Tuesday to about 50 on Thursday, according to American military officials involved in the aid effort. Four more American helicopters are scheduled to begin operations on Friday as Pakistani and American forces search for plateaus in mountain areas where food and medicine can be dropped by parachute. In the flattened northern town of Balakot, Pakistani military doctors said Thursday that head wounds suffered by many people, particularly children whose schoolrooms fell in on them, were becoming infected. The doctors have started treating infected head wounds without the usual anesthetics. At one point, a doctor cut off portions of infected skin and flesh from the head of a crying 5-year-old named Zainab as her uncle held her down. Dr. Rehan, the hospital administrator in Rawalpindi, said that injured people who have waited days for evacuation were arriving with broken bones that had begun to heal crooked. He said his hospital, one of a dozen treating evacuees in the Islamabad area, had rebroken and reset bones for about 170 of the 950 earthquake patients it was treating. In a televised address on Wednesday evening, Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, acknowledged delays in the evacuations of trapped people and burials of the dead. But he stressed the magnitude of the disaster. ''It is the biggest ever tragedy we faced,'' he said. ''All means of communications were disrupted and roads were blocked.'' Throughout the shattered region, families, finding no help coming to them, struggled to take their wounded to help. . On Saturday, Ms. Akhtar said, she found Nadish lying on a stretcher on the street by the school. Teachers had dug her from the school's wreckage. Nadish whispered that she could not feel her legs. Ms. Akhtar, a 32-year-old mother of four who has never attended school, said that Pakistani military doctors based in Bagh told her to take her daughter to an urban hospital, but that she was unable to get a place on one of the helicopters that intermittently reached the town. The road to Bagh reopened three days after the quake, she said, but she could not pay the skyrocketing taxi fares to have her daughter driven to a city hospital. For five days, Ms. Akhtar said, but she was only able to obtain a mild nonprescription painkiller for Nadish, who was riven with pain. She said her husband, one of many Pakistanis who work in the Persian Gulf, could not return home. On Thursday afternoon, Pakistani soldiers loaded her and her daughter onto an American Chinook helicopter with about 35 other injured people and their relatives. Beside Nadish lay a 15-year-old girl with a broken leg whose brother, grandmother and two cousins had died in the earthquake. Behind her was a bony boy with a broken leg. During the flight, evacuees stared blankly at the floor or out the window, worry, bereavement and exhaustion etched across their faces. One man cradled his injured wife. Nadish stared at her mother, and at the rotors pounding overhead, looking lost. When the helicopter landed, Nadish whispered, ''Where are we?'' Her face brightened when told she was in Islamabad. When a group of Pakistani soldiers loaded her onto a stretcher she winced. ''Slowly,'' she whispered. ''Slowly.'' At the hospital, Nadish, with her curly brown hair and bright green eyes, seemed to sense the doctor's bleak diagnosis and began to withdraw. In Pakistan, paralysis is a particularly harrowing fate for a young woman. Nadish is unlikely ever to be a bride, let alone the doctor she had dreamed of. ''It's better to die than to live a life this, this crippled life,'' Ms. Akhtar whispered when her daughter was out of earshot. After the doctors examined Nadish, orderlies placed her on a hallway floor. It was about 8:30 p.m. Surrounded by her shaken mother, and dozens of other evacuees -- some caked in blood, others moaning -- Nadish placed her left arm over her face and communicated in the only way she could. She wept."
"A powerful earthquake centered in the Hindu Kush mountains of Pakistan on Saturday morning sent tremors across South Asia, killing more than 18,000 people, including at least 1,600 in remote northern Pakistan, among them hundreds across both sides of disputed Kashmir. Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan, Pakistan's chief army spokesman, who announced the toll on Sunday, said at least 45,000 people had been injured, a vast majority on the Pakistani side of Kashmir. He said that ''so far there are many areas which have not been reached'' by the army, but that military units were expected to reach all of them by the end of the day. The quake was centered in the far-flung villages of the North-West Frontier Province, but it shook houses and high-rises throughout the region. More than 1,600 were believed to have been killed in that province alone, the provincial police control room reported Saturday night. That toll includes an estimated 650 children who were killed in the collapse of three different schools. Estimates of the quake's magnitude varied from 6.8 to 7.8, with the United States Geological Survey putting the number at 7.6. Its epicenter was roughly 60 miles north of the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, where 20 ''significant aftershocks'' measuring between 5 and 6.2 magnitude were felt throughout the day on Saturday, Dr. Qamar-uz-Zaman Chaudhry, director general of the Meteorological Department in Islamabad, said by telephone on Saturday evening. Officials warned that serious aftershocks could continue for two days. The earthquake, which sent tremors as far east as New Delhi, the Indian capital, and west to Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, was the biggest to strike the country in a century, Dr. Chaudhry said. The top police official of the North-West Frontier Province, Riffat Pasha, said Saturday evening that the death toll there continued to rise and that relief efforts had been stymied by blocked roads and broken communication channels. ''The situation is very, very bad,'' he said. ''There are bodies lying everywhere. Those who have survived are lying in the open without food, shelter or medicine. ''The situation has been made worse by the rain and hailstorm that followed the earthquake,'' he continued. ''There is no way we can reach out to them.'' Private television stations showed images of leveled houses in the Pakistani side of Kashmir. Telephone lines remained down, and roads were blocked because of landslides. Torrential rain on Saturday evening was likely to impede relief efforts. In the Indian-held section of the disputed Kashmir region, the death toll climbed to more than 240 by Saturday evening, including more than 30 Indian soldiers standing sentry at the disputed frontier. An untold number of houses were flattened, telephone lines and electricity were disrupted, and several roads were blocked by landslides, cutting the Kashmir Valley off from the rest of the country. The quake also destroyed a number of religious shrines, mosques and temples. The death toll in Pakistan included 200 soldiers in the Pakistani-controlled section of Kashmir, Interior Minister Aftab Ahmed Sherpao said in a CNN interview. In Rawalpindi, a school for girls collapsed, killing one child and injuring six, said Sheik Rashid Ahmed, the information minister. In eastern Afghanistan, four children were crushed to death and a woman was injured as the mud walls of their homes collapsed. News from remote mountainous areas near the border with Pakistan could take days to reach the provincial capitals. Islamabad was in panic, and people spilled onto the streets. Traffic jams clogged roads, and residents huddled in groups outside houses, shopping plazas and government buildings. The cellphone network collapsed for at least 90 minutes. Margalla Towers, an upscale five-tower apartment complex, took the city's biggest hit from the quake. One tower collapsed, and part of another fell. Army and civil authorities reached the site within 30 minutes. Rescue workers estimated that at least 150 people, mostly women and children, were stranded under the rubble of the building. President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan visited the apartment complex in Islamabad with Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz. General Musharraf expressed satisfaction with the rescue operation. ''It is a test for all of us,'' he said in an interview on state television. ''We are sure we will pass this test.'' In Washington, President Bush expressed his sympathies for the victims of the earthquake. ''Our initial deployments of assistance are underway, and we stand ready to provide additional assistance as needed,'' he said in a statement. ''My thoughts and prayers are with those affected by this horrible tragedy.'' Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also issued a statement, saying she had spoken Saturday morning with the foreign ministers of Pakistan and India to offer American help. ''At this difficult time, the United States stands with its friends in Pakistan and India, just as they stood with us and offered assistance after Hurricane Katrina,'' the statement said. The quake occurred along one of the earth's great collision zones. The Indian subcontinent, including India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, rides on a separate tectonic plate that was attached to Antarctica until 150 million years ago. It broke away and moved north. About 50 million years ago, the plate slammed into Asia, and the buckling of earth created the Himalayan mountains. The Indian subcontinent continues to move north at more than an inch a year. A magnitude 6.2 earthquake in the same area in December 1974 killed 5,300 people. Because the quake on Saturday was shallow, 6 to 10 miles underground, the shaking on the surface was probably more intense than other quakes of its magnitude, said Waverly J. Person, a seismologist with the United States Geological Surveys National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo. ''These are the most damaging earthquakes,'' he said. Because it occurred inland, there was no danger of it setting off a tsunami, as happened after the huge Indian Ocean quake in December. The deadliest recent quake in the region was in January 2001. It was centered in Gujarat in western India and killed about 20,000 people. As for the earthquake on Saturday, no foreshocks gave any sign that a large quake was imminent; several large aftershocks, up to magnitude 6.3, came afterward. At Margalla Towers in Islamabad, army troops and paramedics searched the rubble for survivors and made a human chain to clear the debris. Heavy cranes lifted slabs of concrete from the site. A man who identified himself as Masood and said he lived on the ninth floor of an adjacent building said he was asleep when the tremors rocked the building. He said he ran down all nine flights of stairs. ''It's a miracle that we survived,'' he said. Tasawar Kamal, 29, who lives a half-mile from Margalla Towers, said his family rushed to the rooftop of a nearby apartment complex. ''From the rooftop, we saw the tower collapsing and immediately rushed here because our maternal uncle lives here,'' he said. Tents were set up for people who had been evacuated from the nearby apartment blocks. Officials said they planned to bring dogs and heavy machinery to rescue people stuck in the basement of the collapsed building. A state of emergency was declared at hospitals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. In Lahore, the capital of Punjab Province, two buildings collapsed in Shah Alami neighborhood. No casualties were reported. In the North-West Frontier Province, Balakot, a picturesque tourist town, was among the communities that were leveled. In another town, Mansehra, officials said 70 percent of the houses had collapsed. Mushahid Hussain Syed, a senator, said, ''It is such a disaster, at such a big scale, that the whole nation has to be mobilized.'' PAKISTAN QUAKE ROCKS SOUTH ASIA"
"A CRACK IN THE EDGE OF THE WORLD America and the Great California Earthquake of 1906. By Simon Winchester. Illustrated. 462 pp. HarperCollins Publishers. $27.95. WHAT does it mean to write popular history? Must the author spend long years sifting through libraries and obscure collections to unearth new and tantalizing facts about his subject? Do readers in search of an absorbing yarn really care what information is new or where the book's information comes from? And what role should the author play? Humorless academic? Simple reporter? Or modish raconteur? These are questions that may confront a reader of Simon Winchester's new ''history'' of the country's greatest pre-Katrina natural disaster, ''A Crack in the Edge of the World: America and the Great California Earthquake of 1906.'' The word ''history'' appears in quotation marks because this is not a straightforward account of the earthquake and subsequent fire but a first-person mélange of geology textbook and travelogue grafted onto a recounting of the events that destroyed San Francisco 100 years ago next spring. It's a proudly idiosyncratic book, brimming with words like ''gallimaufry,'' that places Winchester firmly in the category of author-as-raconteur. Me, I hated it. I wanted to drop-kick this book across the backyard. If Doris Kearns Goodwin or David McCullough can lay claim to being the Miles Davis of popular history, Winchester is becoming the Kenny G. Where another author might rely on groundbreaking scholarship or at least narrative drive, Winchester, a geologist turned ''globe-trotting correspondent,'' favors a meandering approach laced with bons mots and fusty subject headings -- e.g., ''The Well-Illumined Earth'' and, on the North American tectonic plate, ''The Plate Entire.'' This is history as it might be written by Austin Powers. ''Crack'' is a book that bears the faint whiff of smoking jacket and brandy, as if the author had curled up in some leatherbound study with a few dozen previous books and his memories and banged out this one between puffs of pipe smoke. It appears to be partly the product of a residency Winchester accepted at San Jose State University, a period that seems to have given him plenty of time to sample sublime pinot noir and thumb through earthquake books. Among the sources thanked in the acknowledgments is a history-savvy waiter at a restaurant on Nob Hill. To be fair, Winchester did do independent travel for his research; in Alaska, he finds not only fault lines and caribous but Champagne, ''a long bath,'' Halibut Bay oysters, freshly caught salmon, wine ''crisp and cold'' and a barmate smoking Gitanes. ''It seemed like heaven,'' he says. At the risk of appearing doctrinaire, I have trouble saying what this book actually is. It is not a memoir, a geology text or a narrative history, though it contains elements of all three. Rather, it seems to be Winchester's ruminations on things already researched by others, wrapped in lectures on geological arcana. It's the kind of book where an author spreads the paint around -- that is, goes wandering down endless back alleys in hopes of finding something interesting, or at least a Halibut Bay oyster. Sometimes Winchester finds a nugget, a metaphoric lost wallet. Other times he spends page after page sorting through garbage. The book begins, for example, with Winchester's take on Wapakoneta, Ohio, a town he once drove near ''on what I seem to recall was a driving expedition from Detroit down to Nashville.'' Wapakoneta turns out to be the hometown of the astronaut Neil Armstrong, whom Winchester uses as a circuitous alley to get to something called the Gaia theory, which posits that the earth is a living, breathing thing. It doesn't appear again until very late in the book, and by then I was nosing through the refrigerator in search of the Grey Goose. What any of this has to do with the San Francisco earthquake, I haven't a clue. Whatever narrative malady Winchester picked up out there trotting the globe, one hopes he shakes it. Like many readers, I became aware of him with the publication of ''The Professor and the Madman,'' a wonderful little book about a psychiatric patient at the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum who contributed many early entries to the Oxford English Dictionary. The telling was lean and taut, and there was a great twist at the end. A couple of years ago I thought of it when I spotted a copy of Winchester's ''Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded,'' and took that book on vacation. But while I expected a tight historical narrative of Krakatoa's 1883 eruption, what I found was a long-winded discourse on volcanology and plate tectonics. Seventy-five pages in, when Winchester embarked on a tangent involving his college-age geological expedition to Greenland, I put the book down in frustration. ''Crack'' follows the Krakatoa formula, including yet another retelling of Winchester's long-ago journey to the Greenland icecap. (Must've been some trip.) Maybe I'm being too hard. ''Krakatoa'' was a minor best seller, so there's clearly an audience out there for Winchester's stylings; Kenny G didn't sell all those CD's for nothing, you know. There's no denying Winchester has a certain je ne sais quoi. His writing burbles along in mellifluous multiple clauses and asides. In time the rhythm grows familiar, even soothing. Close your eyes and you can almost hear -- what's that? -- a saxophone. What you won't hear is much that detracts from Winchester's solo. Few outside voices intrude -- even fewer attributions -- and those that do emerge from the ether. The firsthand accounts left by all the nobodies and somebodies who survived the quake, from Enrico Caruso to John Barrymore, are largely unattributed. Not that Winchester disdains footnotes; he loves them, the more tangential the better. My favorite is the one where he points readers to the chapter in ''Krakatoa'' in which they can find ''a full account of the expedition'' to Greenland. The telling of the quake itself is fine enough, the major weakness being Winchester's lack of interest in developing characters. Barrymore and some faceless others are trotted onto the stage for a minute or two, then shoved back into the wings; there's only one voice that genuinely interests Winchester, and it ain't Caruso's. Other than that, well, he does a neat job describing how the streets of San Francisco bucked and danced that morning. And there's a memorable tale about a Texan who took his rifle and began shooting a herd of cattle stampeding up from the docks. Maybe the problem is false advertising. Had this book been titled ''On the San Francisco Earthquake,'' one might forgive an intellectual walkabout. But subtitling it ''America and the Great California Earthquake of 1906'' suggests not only a new narrative history but an analysis of how the quake changed the country. That's not here. What is here -- consuming half the book, in fact -- is a geology treatise delivered by a roguish old professor who is simply gaga for granite. Winchester has some obvious faults, but lack of enthusiasm isn't one of them. There are maps and charts galore, even a glossary of ''possibly unfamiliar'' terms, but they adorn sections mined with passages as impenetrable as bedrock. Of the San Andreas fault -- Winchester calls it ''that most infamous darling of seismicity'' -- he writes, ''It should be noted that this plate-on-plate strike-slip zone extends between two 'triple junctions' -- places where the two principal plates meet up with two small relict pieces of the old Farallon plate that did not get themselves subducted.'' If your idea of a nutty Friday afternoon is sitting through Geology 101, then this book's for you. Or maybe, if a real book of narrative history appears too daunting, you could, like David Fisher in the tumultuous final episodes of HBO's ''Six Feet Under,'' find comfort in the calming arms of smooth jazz. Bryan Burrough, a special correspondent at Vanity Fair, is the author of four books, including ''Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34.''"
"To the natives of this valley, few things are as certain as the menace already visible on the hilltop. In a matter of weeks, the fresh snow that now sits on that peak will creep down to the high hamlets of this valley. The night winds will blow even colder than they do now, the rubble of their lives will be blanketed in snow, and the one road down to the lowland, blocked now by landslides, will become even harder to cross. And so on Friday, perched at 6,517 feet above sea level at the mouth of a cold and bitter future, the village of Gantar faced a daunting choice: bunker down at home for the winter, or leave behind all that is familiar to go live in a tent city down below. Taj Mian chose to leave. Packed tight with about 50 of his neighbors, he sat on the floor of a Pakistani Army helicopter and stared out the small round window. The hills grew smaller before his eyes. ''This is my land,'' he said. ''Now I have to leave it. I am very sad.'' He was not sure how old he was, but he was old. His fingers were caked with the dirt of the valley. He had never before left the village. According to the latest census, roughly 190,000 people live in the Allai Valley, and the ones who live as high as Gantar must now decide whether to stay or go. The army had considered a mass evacuation earlier in the week but has since said it will encourage only people living above 6,000 feet to come down to the tent cities. In the past few days, army helicopters have been evacuating those who wish to leave. The United Nations high commissioner for refugees said late Friday that dozens of families had come into newly established camps in the nearest big town, Battgram. Depending on how many choose to head down, an exodus of tens of thousands could follow in the coming days. Most will have to trek through the hills. Up in Gantar, opinions were mixed and vexed on the subject of moving. Some said they simply would not make it through the winter without a roof over their heads, and there were still not enough tents to go around. Others were anxious about what would become of their cattle and cornfields. Still others worried about how life in a densely packed camp for displaced people would violate the taboos of their closed and deeply conservative Pashtun culture. Inayat ul-Huq, for one, feared that the women of his family would be exposed to strangers in camp. ''Other people will hear their voices,'' is how he put it. And so, he resolved to keep his wife, his year-old daughter and the rest of his extended family here for the winter. His family had a tent of its own, plus a lean-to fashioned from tin and twigs. As soon as the aftershocks stopped (there have been 900 since the Oct. 8 quake) he would clear the rubble with his hands, he said, and build a hut of stone and tin. He would collect enough firewood and, if he had to, walk three days to Battgram to buy provisions. What if his wife or baby were to fall ill? He said he would treat them with traditional herbs from the hills. ''We'll try to stay as long as we can,'' he said. The Allai Valley is a stunning, if unforgiving, set of terraced hills and houses separated from one another by deep ravines and jagged ridges. Corn and cattle are the staples of life, and it is not uncommon for the men of the valley to head out, down south to Karachi or as far west as the Persian Gulf, in search of work. Many of them had trekked back home in the days after the earthquake. It was impossible to say with any certainty how many had died here, only, as the survivors said, that the death and destruction had paralyzed them all. Then came the aftershocks. For two days, Wali Muhammad waited with his family on the landing pad built for the helicopters. There were many more like him, waiting and cold and worried -- many more than could be accommodated. ''Where they will take us, we will go,'' he said. His niece's daughter screamed in terror. Mr. Muhammad said the girl was frightened by the aftershocks, the most recent of which came on Friday morning at 7:30. His nephew, Fazl Rahim, was likewise resigned to his fate. He had no tent. He had no way to shelter his family for the winter. The army doled out relief, but he had no way of knowing why he had not received anything but a blanket. He said he did not want to complain. ''It's the army,'' was his explanation. Lt. Shehryar Sardar Khan stood before an assembly of frustrated villagers and begged them to listen. ''Go down. You'll get very good food,'' he told the gathering of Gantar's men. ''You'll be uncomfortable for a day or two, but we will take very good care of you afterward. Here, life will be very difficult for you. Please cooperate.'' The men were told to organize themselves into hamlet committees. Blankets were promised. All those who wished to be evacuated were told to wait at the helipad. There was no question in Shah Jahan's mind that he would have to go. He and his nephew, Hazrat Ghulam Shah, both security guards in Karachi, had rushed back home after the earthquake struck. What they saw that first day told them they could not stay. Never had his family deserted their ancestral land like this. But with the aftershocks going on and on, he said, they could not rebuild their homes before the snow comes. Even the corn would be left to their tenants to cut and store. ''The earthquake isn't going away,'' he said, referring to the aftershocks. By midafternoon on Friday, after three days of waiting, it was their turn to board the helicopter. They gathered together their blankets and their babies, and they clambered on. ''Until the snow melts, we won't come back,'' Shah Jahan said. ''Then we will rebuild our houses and work on our land.'' Allai Valley Journal"
"For 18 hours after a powerful earthquake hit Pakistan early Saturday, Mohammad Javed Iqbal, a livery cabdriver in New York City, tried in vain to telephone his relatives. But phone lines into their town of about 30,000 in the North-West Frontier Province were jammed or not working for hours, he said. Finally, he reached his son Bahadur Khan, 25, who, weeping, told him how two cousins, Aurang Zad Khan, 70, and Aujaman Ara, 35, were unable to flee their crumbling home when the quake struck. ''The wall collapsed on them and they died,'' Mr. Iqbal, 66, said yesterday in the section of Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn known as Little Pakistan. His eyes brimmed with sadness and fury above his flowing white beard as he described how their bodies were pulled from the rubble. ''Now the women and children are under the sky, they are living outside.'' Across the New York metropolitan region, where an estimated 120,000 people of Pakistani descent live, many echoed Mr. Iqbal's experience in struggling to learn the fate of family and friends caught in the earthquake. It has not been easy. Telephone service into the country has periodically failed since the quake, and even if a connection is made, there is no guarantee of reaching family or friends in the remote region. ''Not everyone has a phone in their house and that's the thing,'' said Mohammad Razvi, the executive director of the Council of Peoples Organization, a grass-roots network in Brooklyn that serves Pakistani, Indian and Afghan immigrants. Mr. Razvi said that families in the affected areas were trying to pass word of their conditions to neighbors who had telephones. For many relatives in New York City, with scant information available, there was a mounting sense of helplessness and frustration as images on several Pakistani satellite television channels showed the destruction and despair. Some Pakistanis have found an outlet planning charity drives. At the Makki mosque on Coney Island Avenue, where Ramadan prayer services were under way, a money collection for the victims was being organized. In Jackson Heights, Queens, the Ambassador Restaurant planned to hold a fund-raiser timed to end with the breaking of the daily fast observed during Ramadan. Unsolicited donations of clothing have already begun to be dropped off outside the council's office along the southern end of Coney Island Avenue, Mr. Razvi said. ''The people, I can tell you, they're more in shock, it's like, 'Oh, my God.''' Despite the outpouring of aid to victims, some Pakistani immigrants said they were appalled by what they saw as a delay in reaching the remote areas, and focused their anger on the Pakistani government. Kashif Qamar, 32, a limousine driver from Woodbridge, N.J., taking a break at the Pakistan Tea House in Lower Manhattan, said his friend's family was forced to flee the hard-hit town of Abbottabad. ''They don't know what to do,'' he said. ''Basically, it's chaos right now.'' Tariq Khokhar, a Pakistani leader in Brooklyn, offered his home in Islamabad to Mr. Iqbal's relatives, but Mr. Iqbal said they had to turn down the offer, fearing that looters would steal the families' possessions from the ruins. ''We can't leave because everything is under the roof of the house,'' he said. ''How can we leave it there?'' THE PAKISTAN-INDIA QUAKE: THE U.S. RELATIVES"
"A day after the most powerful earthquake in the history of independent Pakistan, President Pervez Musharraf made an urgent televised appeal on Sunday for international aid, at least 140 aftershocks rattled survivors, and rescue crews dug, often with their bare hands, for signs of the living and the dead in the rain-soaked rubble of obliterated villages. From throughout Pakistan, a variety of estimates on the death toll poured in. By evening, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz said 19,369 people had died and at least 43,000 had been injured, based on estimates from local officials. But with much of the country still unseen by the authorities, it was impossible to settle on a definitive figure. ''There are clearly several areas which are inaccessible,'' Mr. Aziz said. ''Gradually, in a day or two, we will reach them.'' At least 600 people were reported killed by the quake in neighboring India, and the United Nations said 2.5 million people in the entire stricken region needed shelter. In Washington, President Bush, whose administration was criticized over its early handling of relief for victims of the Asia-Pacific tsunami and Hurricane Katrina, promised immediate help to General Musharraf, an important ally in the American-led war on terrorism. ''Thousands of people have died, thousands are wounded, and the United States of America wants to help,'' Mr. Bush said. [Page A12.] In these forested hills close to the epicenter, the quake obliterated more than this village. It also took a cornerstone of hope: The Garhi Habibullah Girls High School. In the delirious collective grief on Sunday morning, there was no way to tell how many girls had been studying here, though it was safe to say that hundreds had been, not just from Garhi Habibullah, in the North-West Frontier Province, but from villages as far as 10 miles away, for whom this was the nearest high school for girls. At least 20 women were teaching here -- among the most educated women in the area. The dozen men digging through the rubble of the two-story school were asked how many teachers had survived. They could come up with only one name. Saturday was a school day. The men were scooping out what they could with little more than their hands. A few brought picks and shovels. One man carried a car jack, to try to help lift concrete slabs. Another peered under a pile and saw a woman's bloodied head scarf, but could do nothing to extricate the woman. By the end of the morning, the body of a longtime teacher, named Ruksana, was pulled out, preceded by her dainty green handbag. After that, the digging crew gave up. There was nothing more it could do. When would the government send machines, the men demanded to know. When would food and tents come? The village was gone, and nearly everyone had spent the night in the rain. Anger boiled up from anguish. ''This village has not received any sort of help,'' cried Mohammed Younas, 65. ''We have nothing at present with us. Only our people are trying to dig out the children who are buried and are probably dead.'' In an interview with CNN on Sunday, General Musharraf said Pakistan desperately needed cargo helicopters to reach the most remote areas of Pakistan, medicine, and tents and blankets for the displaced. He confirmed that much of the country had not been reached. He also confirmed that Pakistan's neighbor and historical rival, India, had offered assistance, as had a host of other countries. General Musharraf said the details of India's offer would have to be ironed out. ''You do understand there's a little bit of a sensitivity there,'' he said. The United States Embassy in Islamabad confirmed that eight American military helicopters were due in Pakistan on Monday. Other countries around the world sent condolences and prayers, as well as money -- or pledges of money -- and, more immediately, search teams with dogs, medical workers and equipment, and food and water. Supplies began flowing from fellow Muslim nations, especially those like the United Arab Emirates, where Pakistanis make up much of the work force. Some countries rapidly granted Pakistanis emergency visas; in Britain, which has a large Pakistani population, a special visa desk was set up at Heathrow Airport. The European Commission pledged more than $4 million in emergency aid, and said the figure could grow, as individual member nations added their own more modest offers. China, a relative newcomer as a provider of emergency aid, offered $6.2 million and sent seismologists, medical workers, search dogs and supplies. The World Bank said it was ready to provide $20 million. Turkey, which has had major earthquakes, said it had sent two military planes carrying aid, doctors and rescue workers. Russia sent rescue workers, dogs and tents. President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan -- a nation still recovering from decades of war, and reliant on international aid -- promised helicopters and medical teams. The quake, centered on the disputed province of Kashmir, was the strongest in the area in a century and the worst natural disaster to befall Pakistan since its formation in 1947. It had a magnitude of 7.6, according to the United States Geological Survey, and sent tremors across South Asia. At least 140 aftershocks have been recorded, several of them with a magnitude exceeding 5, Pakistan's state-run media reported. Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani Kashmir, remained inaccessible by road until Sunday evening. With the city hospital destroyed by the quake, a cricket stadium had been turned into a triage center from where the injured were airlifted to other hospitals by the Pakistani military. One man, Mohsin Naqvi, 32, who had reached Islamabad late Sunday, said the government rescue was inadequate. ''There is no proper rescue, no organization,'' he said angrily. ''The whole city has collapsed. There is nothing. We have been walking around dead bodies everywhere.'' Tariq Farooq, minister for communications for the Pakistani side of Kashmir, said the jail and the government office had been destroyed. The dead were being collected at the university grounds. With very few tents available, the living and the dead were left to the elements. Across the Line of Control, on the Indian side of Kashmir, the death toll had tripled from the estimates given Saturday, climbing to 600 by Sunday evening, said Vijay Bakaya, the chief secretary of the province. In some places, angry crowds complained about what they called the local government's delayed start in rescue operations. At Uri, the town closest to the Line of Control, some survivors said the dead and injured remained in the hills, still out of reach of rescue crews. Here in Garhi Habibullah, the village hospital was no more than a horrible heap of tin and concrete. No one seemed to know how many had perished inside, only that a dental technician had been plucked out. The dead also remained inside the high school for boys, but without machinery, it was impossible to retrieve more bodies. The Pakistani military brought in a dump truck at midday. No one, it seemed, had time to mourn here. The men of the village, if they were not digging through the rubble, were digging graves or carrying bodies or whispering prayers for the dead. No one could say with certainty how many bodies had been buried. One man guessed at least 150; another said 400. A 4-year-old boy, Hasan Raza, swaddled in white, was among them. He followed his father, Mohammed Raza, into the grave. ''Make room, make room,'' the gravediggers were told. A group of men came from a jumble of destroyed houses, hoisting on their shoulders another body, wrapped in a blanket. Soon afterward came the body of Tehniat Riaz, a 7th grade student at the Girls High School. She was found in a ground floor classroom two hours after the quake. Her sister, in another classroom, had made it out. The body of her teacher, Saima Irum, 30, was laid in the ground only minutes earlier. The teacher's body, too, had been found a couple of hours after the quake. Relatives said her face had been crushed. Standing before her fresh grave, her uncle, Azmat Shaheen, said that like virtually all of the educated women in the village, his niece had chosen to teach at the Garhi Habibullah Girls High School. She had taught there for a decade. She was about to marry next month. ''She devoted her life for the sake of education,'' Mr. Shaheen said. The provincial police said 150 bodies had been retrieved from the schools in Garhi Habibullah, and 250 people were still missing. Along the picturesque winding road leading down from Garhi Habibullah came taxis, pickup trucks and minivans converted into makeshift ambulances. Convoys of the wounded rolled in to Ayub Memorial Hospital in Abbotabad, a 90-minute drive south from the hills. But it, too, was in precarious straits. Tremors forced medical staff to evacuate patients onto the lawn and parking lot. Rain and hail on Saturday night forced them back inside, only to spill outside once more when the next tremors came. On Sunday, the hospital's various wards were set up under flimsy canopies: one for gynecology, another for psychiatric patients, another for emergency surgery. The hospital will soon need more anesthesiologists, orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons specializing in spinal and head injuries. Doctors predicted that in a few days, when wounds were likely to become infected, antibiotics would be in short supply. Dr. Fara Shah, an ophthalmologist working a shift in the triage tent, said: ''Life and death is in your hands. Mostly it's death in your hands.'' THE PAKISTAN-INDIA QUAKE: THE OVERVIEW"
"THE earthquake in Pakistan has left millions homeless. Umar Ghuman, Pakistan's minister of foreign investment and a longtime customer of my foundry supply company, has asked me to help find housing for as many of these people as possible before the onset of winter in the next few days. Tents are not protection enough, and conventional prefabricated houses are neither readily available nor easy to ship. The solution, then, is to think of something less conventional, like the work shed-greenhouse combinations sold at Sam's Club and other retailers. Such sheds -- small (882 cubic feet), plastic, weather-tight, insulated and portable -- retail for around $2,000. Two hundred thousand of these houses -- temporary homes for a million people -- would cost less than $400 million. These sheds come in sections, such that a C5-A military cargo plane could fit hundreds of units on a single flight. The manufacturer can produce nearly 20,000 units per month, but additional new machinery could be developed promptly to speed up production. Although there are many garden structures to choose from, the one that combines both shelter and greenhouse functions is manufactured in Winfield, Kan. Large enough to house a small family, the work shed and greenhouse, if supplied with water and seed, can also provide bean and alfalfa sprouts as well as other fast- growing vegetables. It can be fitted with solar panels for hot water and electricity. The built-in workbenches are ideal bed platforms. Once delivered to Pakistan, the house kits could be carried in sections by the region's ubiquitous minitrucks, or even by backpackers or helicopters where mountain villages are inaccessible. An experienced team can assemble the houses in minutes on firm, dry, level ground. Their construction is both rugged and flexible enough to withstand future shocks. This is an opportunity for the United States to present to the world a product of our manufacturing ingenuity delivered by our military might. The United States needs to regain credibility with its friends throughout the region, and the people there need housing desperately. How about it, retailers? Can you contribute your inventory to start these houses on their way immediately? How about it, United States Air Force? Will you fly your C5-A's on a humanitarian mission? We need to do this now, not next week or next month. Winter -- with mountain blizzards, powerful winds and subzero temperatures -- will come to the Himalayas in days. The commercial air freight system is already shipping blankets, tents and medical supplies. That's a good start, but it is in no way adequate for housing people in winter. Of course we must remember the needs of our own hurricane victims, as well as the tsunami victims still in makeshift camps. But the winter storms of the high mountains present a mortal threat that demands an immediate response. We have the means. So what are we waiting for?

"It may be the first park in the country literally inspired by 15 seconds. When the Richter scale went jittery for 15 seconds in the Loma Prieta earthquake, the beleaguered West Oakland section here was hit particularly hard. The quake, registering 7.1, caused the collapse of the double-decker Cypress Freeway, killing 42 people and injuring at least 150. It also elicited heroic acts of rescue, with people scaling shaky ladders pieced together with duct tape to free drivers trapped between pancaked sections of concrete. Sixteen years after the event that altered West Oakland, a Quake Memorial Park has opened where the off ramp used to be. The park, designed by April Philips, a landscape architect in Sausalito, is an effort to express emotion in native grasses, wildflowers and stone. But it is also part of a larger effort by the community to redress the ills symbolized by the freeway, which had physically divided West Oakland for decades. Built on land donated to the city by the state transportation authority, the one-acre park has undulating grasses that recall how the freeway rippled during the quake. At its ''epicenter'' are metal sculptures of ladders -- symbols of rescue -- twisted like the contorted highway girders that failed to protect. A wall depicts the Richter scale during those fateful 15 seconds, and residents' memories -- ''For a few seconds,'' one reads, ''the earth had turned to jello'' -- are engraved in concrete. West Oakland, a predominantly black area of chronically high unemployment with a median household income of $18,000, compared with $62,000 for the Bay Area as a whole, was once the terminus of the transcontinental railroad, a historic hub of the African-American community that was home to Pullman porters and jazz musicians. But construction of the freeway in the 1950's destroyed thousands of the area's mostly Victorian houses, many built with redwood from the nearby hills, said Chris Rhomberg, an associate professor of sociology at Yale who is the author of ''No There There: Race, Class and Political Community in Oakland.'' Along with other projects, including the BART train, which runs below ground in other areas but above ground in West Oakland, the freeway helped push out a lot of the population, Professor Rhomberg said. The Loma Prieta disaster then offered a pivotal moment for the community to ''re-decide its planning future,'' he added. A grass-roots effort lobbied successfully against rebuilding the freeway in the middle of West Oakland, making way for the park. ''It represents a bifurcated community coming together,'' said David Glover, executive director of the Oakland Citizens Committee for Urban Renewal. ''It's an ironic outcome,'' Mr. Glover added, ''given the tragedy of the earthquake.'' Amaha Kassa concurs. ''As horrific as the quake was, a lot of people saw the collapse of the Cypress Freeway as divine intervention, giving West Oakland a new chance,'' said Mr. Kassa, executive director of the East Bay Alliance for a Sustainable Economy. Among many, memories of the quake run deep. Every Oct. 17, the anniversary, Tim Petersen, who in the years since has become an Oakland firefighter, puts in a call to Mark Fraser, Victor Cuevas and Andy Papp, who are now his colleagues and who rescued him from a wedge of air that day. Mr. Petersen was one of the few survivors from the freeway's bottom deck, which was crushed by the upper deck for more than a mile. His pickup truck was compressed into an 18-inch-thick piece of metal, and he had multiple major injuries, including a broken back. ''We don't talk about it,'' Mr. Petersen, 40, said of himself and those three fellow firefighters. ''But I call them every year just to tell them thanks.'' The park is part of a broader $11 million landscape design by Caltrans, the state transportation authority, that has turned Mandela Parkway, for years a bleak industrial thoroughfare, into something of a European boulevard, complete with rose bushes and bougainvillea. Before the earthquake, the length of that thoroughfare beneath the freeway was a noisy stretch of blight used to store industrial equipment. ''It was everything except what was desirable for the neighborhood,'' said Ellen Wyrick-Parkinson, one of many citizen activists. West Oakland has begun to deal with other issues as well, among them the onset of gentrification. Nearby is West End Commons, a new live/work development of $1,800-a-month town houses. There are also upscale-housing plans for the historic Southern Pacific Railroad train station, through which many African-Americans migrated to work in the shipyards during World War II. But to many longtime residents, the sight of people actually strolling and biking down Mandela Parkway, bumping into people they know on a Sunday and walking dogs in the park, is a revelation. ''It's not just beautiful, but very relaxing,'' Mrs. Wyrick-Parkinson said. ''It just blows my mind, really.'' Oakland Journal"
"All around this leveled town, thousands of pieces of clothing sit in great heaps, creating bright pockets of color amid fields of gray rubble. A checkered maroon sweater. A pair of bluejeans. A pink shirt. At first glance, the clothing appears to be a sad vestige of the thousands who perished in this mountain town. Instead, it is a testament to the living. In what some Pakistanis are calling the greatest display of national unity in their country's 58-year-history, thousands of volunteers from across the country spontaneously collected vast amounts of food, clothing and medicine and rushed it to northern Pakistan after the severe earthquake of Oct. 8. The piles are the product of an impromptu grass-roots relief effort that Pakistanis say they have never seen before. ''It impressed me and it still impresses me,'' said Abdul Aziz Awan, a 56-year-old ophthalmologist who had suffered the anguish of sitting with his younger brother for three hours, while the brother slowly bled to death beneath the rubble here. ''The amount of response that people have shown, I would say it matched the amount of destruction.'' Aid officials say that the international response to the disaster has been woefully inadequate, and that Pakistan lacks the resources to handle the relief effort on its own. But to an extent not seen in decades, the earthquake appears to have united the country, long divided along ethnic and sectarian lines. Religious violence between Sunni and Shiite Muslims has killed hundreds in the last five years. Dozens were killed during local elections in August and September. And two of the country's minority ethnic groups, Sindhis and Baluchis, continue to bitterly complain about the country's largest ethnic group, the Punjabis, who run the all-powerful army. Yet, most of those divisions appeared to vanish in the face of a cataclysm that, at last count, had killed 51,000 Pakistanis. On Tuesday, trucks laden with donations from youth associations, religious groups, city governments and schoolchildren from across Pakistan arrived here to distribute donated aid. A handwritten banner strung across the grille of one truck seemed to capture the nationwide sense of responsibility. ''In this hour of need,'' it declared, ''please help your grief-stricken brothers with cash, sugar, flour, blankets and warm clothes.'' Hundreds of miles south of the earthquake zone, in the southern port of city of Karachi, schoolchildren and families formed human chains to load donated goods into cargo planes. Dozens of doctors from the finest hospitals volunteered for duty in remote locales to set broken bones and dress infected wounds. ''We came to help these patients,'' said Zubair Ali, a 28-year-old surgeon who was one of 50 doctors from Karachi who flew north on a cargo plane. ''We thought there were a lot of surgeries.'' Even those of Pakistani heritage in the United States and Britain arrived in force. ''It's exhilarating,'' said Abad Rizvi, 25, a Pakistani-American doctor from Los Angeles who raised $10,000 in donations and is volunteering in a clinic here. ''You feel like you're actually helping. They're so thankful.'' Najam Sethi, the editor of The Daily News, one of Pakistan's leading newspapers, said he had never seen such unity in the country, which is hobbled by military rule, corrupt politics, militant Islam and erratic economic growth. ''Given the normal cynicism of Pakistanis, something like this has never happened,'' he said. ''I think the scale of the disaster is something that has touched everyone to the core.'' On Friday, NATO officials in Brussels approved a plan to dispatch 500 to 1,000 soldiers, as well as four helicopters, to Pakistan to aid in relief operations, Agence France-Presse reported. The move came as the top United Nations aid official, Jan Egeland, criticized the international response and called on NATO to begin a huge helicopter airlift to aid an estimated three million Pakistanis left homeless by the earthquake. The aid group Oxfam, meanwhile, called on governments around the world to release their supplies of military tents for earthquake survivors. Umar Farooq, a 28-year-old hospital fund-raiser from Lahore, about 200 miles to the south, said he and a friend decided to volunteer in Balakot after television news reports described stumbling government aid efforts. He and other volunteers credited Pakistan's growing independent news media, particularly several new private cable television stations, with producing vivid coverage that motivated them to act. They questioned whether the state-run media, which enjoyed a monopoly until several years ago, would have disclosed the scope of the calamity. ''Before, nobody knew how bad the damage was,'' said Dr. Khurram Navid, a 27-year-old surgeon from Karachi. Not all earthquake survivors welcomed the hordes of volunteers. Alam Gir, 25, a soldier who lives outside Balakot, said many Pakistanis came to this battered city to gawk at the dead. He also accused volunteers of slowing the overall relief effort. Hundreds of trucks snarled traffic for hours, and some volunteers simply tossed relief supplies off the trucks, sparking brawls among desperate survivors. ''They blocked the road,'' Mr. Gir said. ''They impeded the activity.'' Volunteers and Pakistani nonprofit groups said they acted to fill a void created by government inaction. Mian Irfan Yousuf, 31, a doctor working for the Edhi Foundation, said 25 Pakistani private organizations and four to five religious groups were at work in Balakot. ''The government is doing nothing here,'' he said. Mohammad Akbar, a beleaguered 35-year-old survivor, said he welcomed help from any source. On Tuesday, he was one of thousands of bereft men trudging through the shattered streets of Balakot in search of a truck carrying donated food and supplies. He marveled at the torrent of aid fellow Pakistanis poured into this city and said it buoyed him, physically and psychologically. ''This is like a support for us,'' he said. ''After God, these people support us.''"
"The fissures were political until now. So great was the earth's fury on Oct. 8, Hakim Ali Khan said, pointing up above this village, that even the mountains cracked. Three waterfalls were born. Huge boulders were dislodged from the Himalayas, sending cattle to their deaths in the ravines. Every house crumbled, leaving at least 300 dead and an immeasurable grief. No strangers to loss, the people here in Kamal Kote, a cluster of villages pressed against the disputed Kashmir frontier, have survived three wars in the last half-century. They were shelled from across the cease-fire line, when the two countries nearly went to war a fourth time, in late 2001. Kamal Kote's men were hounded, beaten and killed by Indian soldiers fighting a guerrilla war that began in the late 1980's, and in droves, they crossed over into Muzaffarabad, the capital of the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir. The line has divided Kashmiri families for 50 years. Through a pitiless fluke of nature, the earthquake rumbled practically under that line. The jaljalla, as people here call it, crushed everything on either side. It ushered in a despair that even Kashmiris had not known before. ''The three wars, they were over land,'' said Mr. Khan, who is old enough to remember them all. ''This jaljalla was God's work.'' He called it ''a divine catastrophe.'' Divided still, Kashmiris on this side have only hints about the destruction just across the ridge. When the quake hit Muzaffarabad on Oct. 8, Irshad Ahmed Bucch saw his family sundered. His wife died. His daughter lived, but the shock made her mute, and in the last week, she has not shed a single tear. This was a family Mr. Bucch, 67, had built from scratch. He had come to Muzaffarabad more than 50 years ago, after the first war to divide Kashmir, leaving practically all his relations on the other side. Divided Loyalties Kashmiris have paid the heaviest toll in the 58 years of bloody bickering between India and Pakistan. Their land and their loyalty lie at the heart of two wars the countries have fought since the ouster of British rule in 1947 and the birth of both nations. The rift is much more than a territorial dispute. Entrenched and emotional, the contest over Kashmir tests the creation myth of each republic. Pakistan was founded as a homeland for South Asia's Muslims, and it considers Kashmir, a region with a Muslim majority, to be rightfully its own. India, with a largely Hindu population, sees itself as a secular democracy able to protect its religious minorities; Kashmir is its only Muslim-majority province. Kashmir was an independent kingdom before 1947; Mr. Khan, of Kamal Kote, began his career as a police officer under its last ruler, Maharajah Hari Singh. But soon after the two nations carved out their territories in an orgy of violence, the maharajah, a Hindu ruler of a largely Muslim populace, signed away his kingdom to India. A plebiscite was promised by India to allow Kashmiris the right to choose whether they wished to belong to India or Pakistan. That plebiscite never came. In 1987, after state elections that many here said had been rigged, Kashmiris on the Indian side took up the gun. Ever since, India has accused Pakistan of arming the guerrillas; Pakistan says it provides only political support. The earthquake does not seem to have entirely crushed the legacy of mistrust. Kashmiris on either side still have no way to communicate with their relatives across the line. The one connection across the province -- a bus service begun six months ago to allow travel between Muzaffarabad and Srinagar, the capital of the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir -- has been indefinitely postponed. The so-called Peace Bridge that connects the divided province is itself badly damaged. Rebuilding a Family Mr. Bucch left Srinagar more than 50 years ago, with $2 in his pocket, an uncle to look up in Muzaffarabad and a vague desire to experience life on the other side of the line. At the time, he thought the troubles between India and Pakistan would last no more than a few months. He was convinced he would come home soon. ''We were emotional,'' he recalled. ''We were young.'' He was also wrong. India would repeatedly deny him a visa to return home. Phone calls between the two Kashmirs were prohibited. Only twice in all that time did he manage to see his relatives on the Indian side. The last was in April of this year, when Mr. Bucch made the maiden journey on that bus from Muzaffarabad, to attend the wedding of a nephew he had never seen. His wife took the second bus, and the two came home together after a joyous month visiting the relatives. All the while, on the other side of the line, Mr. Bucch had painstakingly rebuilt a family. He married, raised six children, established a chain of hardware stores, and built a two-story house in one of Muzaffarabad's finest neighborhoods. On Saturday, he sat alone in his yard, surrounded by the remnants of a life of striving. The lush green grass he planted a quarter-century ago. The roses that his mother-in-law had tended for years. The two-story house lay in a heap behind him. ''There is definitely a lot of sorrow,'' he said. ''I don't have any words.'' His daughter, Samra, in her mid-20's, who lay trapped in the rubble next to her lifeless mother, was pulled out alive after four hours. The body of his wife, Sabia, was extracted a day later. Her body showed no injuries. The family consoles itself by saying she died of a heart attack. Mr. Bucch refused to surrender to grief. He had overcome calamity before. ''Things get better each time,'' he said. ''We work hard and things get better.'' A Test of the Spirit Hakim Ali Khan was a police officer in Muzaffarabad, when ethnic Pathan fighters rolled in from the newly created Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the first war broke out. That night, Mr. Khan shed his uniform and made his way through the forested hills back home to Kamal Kote. In the coming months, Kamal Kote would be occupied for many months by Pakistani forces. When they were driven out by Indian forces and the cease-fire line was drawn, Mr. Khan, a student of these mountains, would guide them from ridge to ridge to mark their posts along the Line of Control. The family's grazing land ended up on the other side. In the shelling of the second war, in 1965, one of Mr. Khan's cows was killed. During the third, fought in 1971 over the Indian-supported secession of what was then East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, Kamal Kote was shelled once more. Nor was Mr. Khan immune from violence at the hands of Indian soldiers in 1991, when the anti-Indian insurgency blossomed. His fifth son, Mohammed Yunus, 30 then, was interrogated, tortured with electrical shocks, shot dead and dumped on the line. The army later told Mr. Khan they suspected his son of having sheltered militants, a claim the family vehemently denies. The army gave him a little more than $2,000 in compensation; today it represents Mr. Khan's only savings. Throughout the 1990's, the militancy fueled clashes between the government and guerrillas here in Kamal Kote. Countless young men crossed over to the other side, some seeking refuge, others training to fight the Indian Army. Maskeen Phatti's cousin, a teenager at the time, fled after being beaten by Indian soldiers. Manzoor Fahim's husband and two sons left in the cover of night, without any explanation. Mohammed Sharif got a letter from his brother only last year, giving a return address in Muzaffarabad; he left15 years ago. None had received any news of whether their kinfolk had survived the earthquake. Among those who had surrendered and returned home, Mohammed Maqbool on Saturday collected blankets from the Indian Army, an astonishing snapshot of how much the earthquake had upended everything. On Oct. 8, Mr. Khan, who gave his age to be somewhere around 90, woke up with a premonition of trouble: His tongue had gone dry. Perhaps something had happened to the children, he worried. At 9:20 a.m. , Mr. Khan was cutting cornstalks in front of his house, when the earth rumbled as though a bomb had gone off in the belly of the mountain. The ground shook violently beneath his feet. He gripped the earth with his hands to steady himself and when he looked up, he saw his house, three stories high, crumple upon itself. He looked to his side and saw his wife, Begum Noor, and one of his granddaughters. He thanked God they were alive. Then, house by house, child by child, he tallied the losses. His children's three houses were crushed. Four grandchildren died, as well his nephew's daughter. For the first two days, no one ate. Slowly, provisions were hauled out of the ruin. Whatever could be salvaged -- a wooden beam, bed sheets, tin sheets of roofing, a cylinder of cooking gas -- was put to use. Throughout Kamal Kote, still with no tents a full week after the earthquake, survivors scraped together lean-tos of straw and plastic, and, if they were more lucky, as Mr. Khan was, a shack made of tin and wood. Sitting inside, as rain beat down mercilessly overhead, Mr. Khan held his open palms to the sky and looked up. His face was streaked with tears, and he demanded this of his God. ''What have I done? Why did you finish us?'' That morning, a tremor mild by comparison with the one on Oct. 8, rumbled under Kamal Kote. First came the loud explosion. Then, the earth rocked. In a flimsy tent built of tin and tarpaulin, Mr. Khan's grandchildren wailed in fresh terror. Just over their village, the first snow appeared that morning. A bitter winter would be here in days."
"SPEAKING after Hurricane Katrina, President Bush promised that ''we will do what it takes, we will stay as long as it takes, to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives'' on the Gulf Coast. ''As long as it takes'' may not be as long as a lot of people expect. Consider what happened after a major earthquake struck Kobe, Japan, in 1995. Many people, in Japan and abroad, thought that the port city would take years, even decades, to recover. The quake, which had a magnitude of 6.9, was the worst ever to hit a modern city. It wrecked the port; destroyed 100,000 buildings and severely damaged many more; ruptured the water, sewer, electrical and gas systems; and destroyed roads and rail lines. Yet despite the catastrophe, Kobe's economy recovered rapidly. Only a year after the quake, Kobe was handling as many imports as before the disaster, and exports had recovered to 83 percent of their previous level. Within 18 months, manufacturing was at 98 percent of where it would have been without the quake. ''Economic output was back in 15 months and could have been sooner if there hadn't been so many disputes about land use,'' the economist George Horwich said in an interview. Kobe's resilience, he argued, was not an aberration. Modern economies bounce back quickly from natural disasters because they depend not on physical assets but on human expertise. People quickly figure out how to replace damaged operations, either by rebuilding or finding substitutes. ''Destroy any amount of physical capital, but leave behind a critical number of knowledgeable human beings whose brains still house the culture and technology of a dynamic economy, and the physical capital will tend to re-emerge almost spontaneously,'' Professor Horwich, now retired from Purdue, wrote in ''Economic Lessons of the Kobe Earthquake,'' published in the April 2000 issue of Economic Development and Cultural Change. Rebuilding lives and communities does not, however, mean returning the economy to exactly where it was before. Rather, a disaster tends to accelerate economic changes that are already under way. That is because some physical assets, whether outdated manufacturing plants or homes in declining areas, are worth keeping only because they were paid for long ago and cost next to nothing to use. They would cost more to replace than they are worth. ''Any modern economy is normally in constant flux,'' Professor Horwich wrote. ''As such, the destruction of physical assets is a form of accelerated depreciation that hastens the adoption of new technologies and varieties of investment.'' In Kobe, the plastic shoe industry never came back after the earthquake, and air freight expanded at the expense of the port. The more flexibility businesses and individuals have, the more adaptable they can be and the faster recovery can take place. That is one reason money helps more than in-kind gifts. Donors, Professor Horwich said, ''can only guess what recipients want most'' and often provide gifts of clothes or food in forms that are hard to use. The same principle applies to the rebuilding commitments now being made in Washington. The final cost of Katrina relief is widely expected to top $100 billion, and the Louisiana Congressional delegation has submitted its own $250 billion wish list. Those are very big numbers. With $100 billion, the government could give every man, woman and child from New Orleans a check for $200,000. Expanding these payments to the entire metropolitan area would allow a generous $75,000 per resident. Yet nobody expects the displaced residents of New Orleans to see anything close to those potentially life-changing amounts. Federal spending is aimed not at ''rebuilding lives'' but at ''rebuilding communities,'' primarily by spending a lot of money on construction projects and on government services. But, the Harvard economist Edward L. Glaeser argues, such an approach is backward. ''If there is disaster insurance, then it is, presumably, the people of New Orleans who are insured, not the place itself,'' he writes in an article for The Economists' Voice, an online journal (www.bepress.com/ev). The article is called ''Should the Government Rebuild New Orleans, or Just Give Residents Checks?'' He favors the latter. His basic argument is that individuals are better at picking where to live and work than any centralized government planner. Evacuees know their own wishes, skills and opportunities. Besides, ''if you're going to bet on place,'' Professor Glaeser said in an interview, ''New Orleans is probably not the right place to be betting on. It's a mid-19th-century city built around a tremendous water-based advantage of the mid-19th century, not around any kind of advantage of use in the 21st century.'' The port is economically vibrant, but it employs fewer than 7,500 people, most of them highly skilled. The oil and gas industries employ even fewer local residents. Trying to restore the city to its prehurricane state does not offer its displaced residents, particularly the poor, much hope for a better life. ''It's just crazy to think that the right insurance mechanism is to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on public infrastructure,'' Professor Glaeser said in the interview. In the article, he said: ''There is a big difference between rebuilding lives and rebuilding communities. Given limited funds, the two objectives may well conflict.''

"With temperatures plummeting to 41 degrees in the foothills of the Himalayas on Friday, India faced an acute shortage of tents, leaving earthquake survivors in the villages of Kashmir to spend their seventh night outdoors. More than 32,000 houses were flattened by the 7.6-magnitude earthquake, the Indian government has said. Roughly 1,300 people were killed by the quake alone, but how many might have died later as a result of their injuries or perished in the cold remained unknown. The state government of Indian-controlled Kashmir said Friday that more than 30,000 tents were needed, and there were conflicting reports on how many had been dispatched to the area so far; the estimates ranged from 4,000 to 6,000. Either way, the vast majority of survivors had to make do with nothing but what they could salvage from the wreckage of their former homes. ''We are very much in need of tents,'' said Muzzafar Baig, the minister for finance and planning for Jammu and Kashmir State. ''That is our major problem today.'' In Pakistan, an equally daunting problem has emerged: finding enough hospital beds for the thousands of injured. United Nations and Pakistani officials said the more than 5,000 people injured in the Islamabad area have filled local hospitals to capacity. They said efforts were under way to find new places to house additional victims, or to establish field hospitals in remote areas affected by the earthquake. The adequacy of relief efforts has been a sore point throughout the region. The state government of Indian-controlled Kashmir has been criticized for what many survivors call its slow response, as has the Indian government for its insistence that it needed no foreign intervention in relief operations. India has already sent to its neighbor and rival, Pakistan, two shipments of relief materials. ''If the Indian government doesn't have tents, why is there hesitance in accepting international aid?'' said Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, the leader of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, a coalition of Kashmiri separatist groups, in an interview here Friday. The state government on Friday announced a compensation package of roughly $2,380 for each completely destroyed house. Families would also be given the same amount for each relative who died. The Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has also announced a $143 million relief package for the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir. When aid did come to this area, its distribution resulted in pandemonium. Relief trucks were mobbed from all sides on Thursday in the village of Kamal Kote. One person took away four blankets; others got none. Syed Ali Akbar Shah, 65, a former porter for the Indian Army, stood on the side of a road seeking help on Thursday. After three hours, he had collected a packet of biscuits, a candle and a matchbox, amounting to small consolation after his house had been destroyed. ''Everything was finished in 10 seconds,'' Mr. Shah, 65, said. ''Within seconds we became beggars.'' Stories of long waits and inadequate aid could be heard across the region. In Pakistan, at least 71 amputations have been carried out on earthquake victims whose wounds became infected while they waited days for evacuation by helicopter, Pakistani doctors said Friday. Doctors predicted that amputations would continue. ''They are increasing day by day,'' said Brig. Ahmad Nadeem, the head of the Combined Military Hospital near Islamabad, which has received more than 2,000 patients injured by the earthquake. ''We may need to have more artificial limbs.'' United Nations officials said they still did not how many injured people remained trapped in the mountainous, Pakistani-controlled areas of Kashmir six days after the quake hit the region. ''We still don't know the condition of people in the most remote areas,'' Rachel Lavy, a World Health Organization official, said by telephone. Injured evacuees brought by helicopter on Friday to hospitals near Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, said large numbers of the injured remained in their villages. ''Helicopters have not been to my village,'' said Abdul Qayyum, who carried his newly paralyzed wife 18 miles with six other men to reach a helipad. ''People are forced to live in the open.'' A day after United Nations officials called for a tripling of the 50 helicopters now being used to evacuate victims, two American military helicopters joined the evacuation effort, which is now focused on remote areas. Pakistani officials said rescue teams continued to search for survivors on Friday, although hopes for their survival were fading quickly. Miracles continued to occur, aid workers said. On Friday, a 1 1/2-year-old girl was pulled out of the wreckage of her house in Mansehra, Pakistan, one of the quake-devastated districts in North-West Frontier Province, according to a private television channel. Dr. Mazhar Hussain, the head of the rescue team, told the channel that the girl was found under a collapsed door, which shielded her against debris. Her two brothers were found dead, but her father was alive and elated at finding his daughter alive, according to Dr. Hussain. ''After gaining consciousness, she clung to a doctor in the rescue team and would not stop crying,'' Dr. Hussain said. Other reports pointed to more grim news. The International Committee of the Red Cross said the isolated Neelam and Leepa valleys appeared to be even more damaged than the areas reached by government and aid workers. More than half of the population in those two valleys is believed to be dead, according to reports in the Pakistani news media. For all the destruction and despair, the earthquake apparently brought no respite from the insurgency that has gripped Kashmir for more than 15 years. The Indian police confirmed Friday that a suspected suicide bomber was killed Thursday as she tried to attack an army convoy on the road from Srinagar to Jammu, the state's winter capital. The bomb strapped to her body exploded prematurely, before she reached the convoy, the police said. One of the principal militant groups fighting a guerrilla war against the Indian Army in Kashmir , Jaish-e-Muhammad, claimed responsibility for the attack, according to a local news agency, Current News Service. It is the first time that a woman has been used in the insurgency as a suicide bomber. The Indian Army has continued its counterinsurgency operations as well, Col. Hemant Juneja, an army spokesman, said. In addition to the suspected suicide bomber, 16 suspected militants were killed this week. Colonel Juneja said they were trying to infiltrate Indian territory."
"When their ceiling collapsed eight days ago, it broke both legs of Taj Bibi, 7, and both legs of her 5-year-old brother, Zahid Rehman, as well. On Monday, after more than a week living in makeshift casts in this mountain valley cut off from the world by landslides, the two children saw a doctor for the first time. ''I was very upset,'' said the children's father, Mohammed Noor, describing the torturous wait. ''I was awake 24 hours.'' The children's story may provide hints of what may lie here in the Alai Valley, the northernmost point that Pakistani forces have reached in the search for survivors of the huge earthquake on Oct. 8. Behind one ridge overlooking this picturesque village is an area where hundreds of dead and injured people are believed to be, according to villagers, but no outsiders have yet reached there. A helicopter flight into this remote valley on Monday revealed a landscape of devastation and mystery. Hundreds of survivors of the earthquake swarmed a Pakistani military helicopter when it landed between a stream and the village, on the second day of flights into the area. Valleys like this one represent a post-earthquake emergency that aid workers say is haunting them. Thousands of earthquake victims believed to have fractured bones and other serious injuries have received no medical attention in isolated villages, according to United Nations officials. Another grave problem is descending on this area, too: in just weeks, the brutal Himalayan winter will engulf hundreds of thousands of people who now have no shelter. ''Either we'll die or we'll run,'' said Muhammad Sharif, a 45-year-old forest ranger. Robert Holden, head of the United Nations Coordination Center in the earthquake-damaged city of Muzaffarabad, the capital of the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir, said Sunday that the outside world did not seem to grasp the stakes in Pakistan. Unless the aid effort here quickly accelerates, he said, the coming weeks may bring a higher death toll than the 41,000 thought to have died in the quake itself. ''The gravity of the situation is not getting through,'' he said. ''I just get the perception that the message is not getting realized.'' This valley shows the dangers that linger in northern Pakistan, as well as how difficult it will be to counter them. As dramatic images of devastation have faded from television screens this week, relief experts said they have found the scope of their task in Pakistan to be far worse than expected. Damage is more widespread. The terrain is more difficult. The weather is more unpredictable. Helicopters, the most critical element of the relief effort, remain in short supply. Tamur Mueenuddin, a health officer with Unicef, which is coordinating relief flights in the area, said the two children with broken legs may not be alone. ''For every case like this that you find, there are many cases that are up there that we're not seeing,'' he warned. ''We're hoping people will carry children out.'' Some aid officials here have criticized the overall response to the earthquake relief effort, either from potential donors or other aid organizations. But Andrew Macleod, the United Nations' operations chief in Pakistan, said the problem was the size of the task at hand, not the response. He said the number of helicopters devoted to the search-and-rescue efforts had grown to 80 by Monday. (Pakistani officials put the number at 60.) But he added that a total of 120 would be needed to carry out effective rescues. ''This is a phenomenal response,'' he said. ''But it's bigger than all of us put together.'' While rescue operations and damage assessments have been carried out in major towns, only 30 to 40 percent of an estimated 350 to 900 villages damaged by the earthquake have been inspected, according to the United Nations. Just how many people live in those villages is unclear. For Taj Bibi and Zahid Rehman, the children with broken legs, Monday brought relief in many forms. A Pakistani doctor recently flown into the village removed the crude cornstarch casts the villagers had put on their legs. A helicopter then flew them to a larger town, where doctors found that their wounds were well cleaned and had not become infected, and that their legs would not have to be amputated. But villagers in their valley said more medical evacuations and tents were desperately needed, and Pakistani officials agreed. Lt. Col. Zakeer Abbasi, the commander of the 500 Pakistani troops who were airlifted into the valley this week, said 214,000 people are spread across 28,000 acres. Aid has reached only 30 percent of the valley's 350 villages. He predicted thousands of additional deaths if shelter is not provided within the next 15 days. Overall, of the roughly three million people living in the earthquake zone, United Nations officials say as many as 300,000 may need some form of shelter, a staggering figure weeks before the onset of winter. ''We need more winterized tents than exist in the world today,'' Mr. Macleod said."
"In this remote town, which aid groups and the Pakistani government have taken so long to reach, the serious young men with Kalashnikov rifles and walkie-talkies have been busy. At the gate of their camp, they direct survivors toward tents, food and medical care, and vehicles stream in with supplies. The men have been the face of the earthquake relief effort here, in a Pakistan-administered region of Kashmir, but there is no mistaking the look of the mujahedeen about them -- the Kashmiri militants outlawed by Pakistan and listed as terrorists by India and the United States. By far the most active organization working to help here has been Jamaat ud-Dawa, an offshoot of the banned militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba. Because of its long connection with the region, the group has been able to step in quickly where the government response has been slow. And though the quake killed many Kashmiri militants, the disaster is giving them help in financing and a chance to raise their standing among the people, something their leaders have been quick to capitalize on. ''This is a great disaster sent from God, and the people are in great trouble,'' said Hafiz Muhammad Said, an Islamic professor from Lahore, Pakistan, in his 60's and the founder of Jamaat ud-Dawa, as he inspected the relief efforts. ''But the good thing is that people from all over Pakistan are giving aid.'' For the hundreds of villagers straggling in after walking for days over the landslides from the earthquake-stricken Neelam Valley, to the northeast, the Jamaat ud-Dawa camp is the stop. ''Medical and Surgical Camps. Jamaat ud-Dawa,'' the large banner at the entrance reads in Urdu and English. ''Ambulance, Rescue, Needy Temporary Villages, Dead Body Burial.'' Doctors and surgeons donate their time to work in the tented surgical unit, and hundreds of young volunteers come and go, bringing in the injured, unloading supplies and digging graves. Turkish and Indonesian medical teams have also set up within the camp. ''They are sincere,'' Dr. Tayyar Vardar, a Turkish doctor working in the camp with a vaccination team from Istanbul. Under the trees on a flat piece of canvas, whatever the time of day, a shifting group of people is praying. Further along the road, where a dozen houses collapsed and slid down a hillside, Jamaat ud-Dawa volunteers took turns to dig a grave for a 6-year-old boy named Murat, who had just been pulled from the rubble by a Turkish rescue team. They wrapped the little body in a sheet and carried him to the grave site, used the dust on the ground to perform ritual ablutions, and led prayers before his father laid the boy in the grave. ''Only the mujahedeen are helping, from Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jamaat ud-Dawa,'' said the boy's father, Altaf Kyani, 35. ''One hour after the earthquake, they were here helping pull people out of the rubble. The army only came on the fourth day.'' After he had buried his son, Jamaat ud-Dawa members took him up to the camp to make sure he was given a tent. ''People like them,'' a neighbor, Zishan Gillani, 25, said of the group's members. ''They are humanitarian workers and have always been here with the people.'' Much like the Afghan mujahedeen parties of the 1980's, Lashkar-e-Taiba was a political organization that ran relief programs, medical services and schools, in particular in camps for Kashmiri refugees. The group has turned out tens of thousands of radical Islamic students over the years, as well as training and supplying an estimated 200,000 fighters for the fight against security forces in Indian-run Kashmir. India has frequently blamed Lashkar-e-Taiba, and now Jamaat ud-Dawa, for violence, and specifically for an attack last December on the Parliament building in New Delhi that brought India and Pakistan close to war. Muhammad Yahya Mujahid, a spokesman for Jamaat ud-Dawa, insists that Lashkar-e-Taiba exists only in the Indian sector and that Jamaat has no military activities of its own. Jamaat ud-Dawa, which means the Party of Preaching and was founded as the larger group's proselytizing branch, has taken over Lashkar-e-Taiba's activities on the Pakistan side. It raises money, runs 180 schools and colleges, and organizes relief programs, continuing under the leadership of Mr. Said. ''It is a political and religious party,'' Mr. Mujahid said. But he agreed that the group supported the aims of Kashmiri militants. ''We give moral support to the mujahedeen, and we want them to free Kashmir,'' he said in an interview at the camp. Jamaat ud-Dawa is known to run training camps and mujahedeen activities on both sides of the Line of Control, which separates the two regions of Kashmir. Two of those camps were badly damaged in the earthquake, and hundreds of Lashkar-e-Taiba militants died, according to mujahedeen interviewed around Muzaffarabad. Mr. Said said Jamaat ud-Dawa itself had lost 15 to 20 members but said he had no information of the effect of the earthquake on mujahedeen groups. Whatever the losses, they do not seem to have devastated the group or slowed its activities. The usually press-shy Mr. Said, who was arrested twice by Pakistan in 2002 and held for several months, spoke with journalists at the group's camp. He said thousands of Jamaat ud-Dawa volunteers had spread out across the districts of Kashmir to bring assistance. His relief fund had already raised about $840,000 in the past week, and he said it would be used to rebuild houses and mosques and to gather orphaned children and put them in the group's schools. Asked if this meant the earthquake had given him an opportunity to expand his organization and improve its image, Mr. Said said: ''What we are doing is in the name of God, the people will see it for themselves. You do work for God, and God will see your efforts.'' Correction: October 21, 2005, Friday An article on Tuesday about Kashmiri militant groups' contributions to the earthquake relief effort in Pakistan misstated the date of an assault on the Indian Parliament, in which some of those groups are accused. It occurred on Dec. 13, 2001, not last year."
"The latest face-off between India and Pakistan in the aftermath of the Oct. 8 earthquake centers on the question of how to deliver aid across the heavily fortified Line of Control that divides Kashmir. That line is the central source of their dispute of more than a half-century -- as well as virtually the epicenter of the quake. Since it struck, the two sides have fired off proposals and counterproposals on how to best assist survivors on each side. Relief has been offered and rejected. Credit and blame have been assigned. The nubs of history have poked out of the rubble again and again. It is plain that even as landslides washed away the very hills that India and Pakistan fought over so bitterly, their 58-year-old legacy of mistrust and bitterness endures. Whether their initiatives represent earnest humanitarian gestures or strategic moves in a game of political one-upmanship remains unclear. And as always between these nuclear rivals, what backdoor dialogue may be under way is a mystery. Publicly, the jousting continues. Asked about his relationship with the government of India, the Pakistani president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, testily told the British Broadcasting Corporation on Friday, ''If they don't trust me, I don't trust them.'' He added, ''It's mutual.'' Later that day, Pranab Mukherjee, the Indian defense minister, responded in kind. One earthquake, he told the BBC, ''cannot alter the history of the last 50 years.'' Actually, as the leaders and the people on each side well know, the quake and its aftermath could make history between them. After all, the death toll has risen to 53,000, a vast majority in Pakistan, and three million people have been left homeless. But the latest exchange between the governments shows how enduring are the ties that divide. Last Tuesday, General Musharraf suggested to reporters in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir that the two countries should open the Line of Control, to help Kashmiris on both sides. On Saturday, India proposed that quake victims living in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir be allowed to avail themselves of medical relief at three points on the Indian side. Pakistan countered that Kashmiris on each side should be allowed to cross at five points, and not just for medical help. On Sunday, the comments from each capital made clear that no deal was imminent. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesman, Navtej Sarna, on Sunday outlined the difference this way: ''What we said yesterday was a focused humanitarian proposal. Theirs is a larger thing that goes over and beyond the earthquake.'' He added, ''I don't know what shape the mutual agreement will take.'' His counterpart in Pakistan agreed that the two proposals were far from aligned. Pakistan offered what its foreign office spokeswoman, Tasnim Aslam, called ''a comprehensive proposal'' for opening the Line of Control, while India, she said, offered only medical relief. She said officials from both countries would have to meet to work out logistical details. The Indian Army, meanwhile, announced that the three relief centers would open by Tuesday. A close aide to General Musharraf said Pakistan would not stop people from crossing the line, but wanted a system to ensure that militants could not cross. It is not yet known whether the post-disaster opportunity for lasting détente will be squandered. Talat Masood, a commentator and a retired Pakistani general, said each side had disappointed him. ''The human aspect could have prevailed, everything could have been set aside and acted as an anchor for the great leap they could have taken politically,'' he said. ''But they have been the prisoners of the past.'' Had the two sides taken that leap, General Masood continued, the main concerns of each could have been ironed out. Pakistan could have been pressed to check the flow of militants into Indian-controlled Kashmir. India could have been pressed to discuss the fate of Kashmir. ''It only shows that the political commitment which they profess -- both sides, the leadership -- is rhetorical and not substantive,'' he said. ''None of them are prepared to take bold steps.'' Bold ideas have come from each side. They have been quashed. Shortly after the earthquake struck on Oct. 8 at 9:20 a.m. India time (8:50 a.m. in Pakistan, since the two countries cannot even stand being in the same time zone), the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, offered supplies and helicopters and suggested that joint search and rescue teams be deployed near the Line of Control. General Musharraf responded with caution, citing the ''sensitivity'' of accepting Indian aid. Within days, Pakistan accepted Indian relief -- including tents, which earthquake victims on the Indian side also needed desperately -- but rejected joint operations in Pakistani territory. As for helicopters, Pakistan said it could only accept the equipment and not Indian pilots. India said that was out of the question. Last Tuesday, President Musharraf, speaking to reporters, called for the Line of Control to be opened. India swiftly issued a statement welcoming the idea, but asked for a concrete proposal from Pakistan. Two days later, Pakistan's disaster relief chief, Gen. Farooq Ahmed Khan, declared that India had rejected Pakistan's proposal. India said it had not yet received a proposal. By Sunday, with the death toll continuing to rise, the finger-pointing was in full swing. In Outlook, an Indian newsweekly, the columnist, Prem Shankar Jha, took General Musharraf to task. ''We knew that the road to peace would be long; the earthquake has made it longer,'' he wrote. ''It has also placed a question mark on President Musharraf's ability to stay upon it.'' An editorial on Sunday in the Pakistani English daily, The News, excoriated India for not agreeing to Pakistan's proposal. ''Though the notion is largely based on actual humanitarian sentiment,'' it said, ''India seems unable to ignore the political factors.'' News Analysis"
"MOHAMMED NASIR, a taxi driver from the Pakistani side of Kashmir, soothed his wounded little girl and cursed the soldiers who brought her to a modern, humming military hospital in this Pakistani garrison city. What did the Pakistani Army do for his village in Kashmir, crushed and crippled by last Saturday's earthquake? ''Almost nothing,'' he spat. Yes, they airdropped packets of milk and a few packets of rice, but those disintegrated during the descent, he recalled. Yes, they airlifted his daughter, 6 years old and with a broken leg, but they abandoned the vast majority of the wounded to curse their fate at home. ''We were brought in a small helicopter that carried four,'' Mr. Nasir said bitterly. ''The rest were left.'' Mr. Nasir's indictment, born of both rage and reason, did not necessarily reflect all that was being done in the vastness of this calamity by the two armies that have faced each other in the disputed region of Kashmir for 55 years. But in it lay a window into the huge challenge that his government, and that of India, face in the aftermath of an earthquake that struck on Oct. 8. Like few things before it, this calamity has tested the mettle of the state in both countries, and no institution more than their armies. The circumstances present slightly different challenges for India and Pakistan. The Pakistani military controls every important institution in its country, starting with the presidency, on a claim that only it can deliver order and honest government now. Will its performance in the earthquake zone prove it to be a bulwark of order and incorruptibility? India, by contrast, has long been seen as an occupying power by many of Kashmir's citizens. Will its efforts endear it to civilians, or alienate them even more? Having fought three wars, both countries devote large shares of their budgets to their militaries -- roughly 2.7 percent of gross domestic product in India and about 5 percent of a much smaller gross domestic product in Pakistan. One obvious challenge in Kashmir will be to show that these resources can be used at least as effectively as aid from Islamic charities now raising funds from Saudi Arabia to the United States. That the quake rumbled under the disputed frontier in Kashmir is perhaps the most tragic paradox. It has wrought new ruin on a region already eviscerated by war. Pakistan has long portrayed itself as the true defender of Kashmiris and their call for independence. But featured in an English-language Pakistani newspaper last week was a photograph of Kashmiri men, their fists in the air, in angry protest -- not against the Indian government, but against their own. It was taken in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. In Srinagar, the capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir, frustrations with the pace of government relief also ran high. Six days after the quake, there were no tents or blankets for the homeless, bracing against the onset of winter in the hills. They used wood from the rubble as fuel to prepare whatever food they could retrieve. The Indian Army, posted everywhere in these hills, had brought relief rations consisting of about four pounds each of rice and lentils. But the first glimpse of the civilian administration was a medical team that arrived on day six after the quake. ''We feel that we just do not exist,'' said Mohammed Latif Shah, whose mother died in the earthquake in a village near the disputed frontier. ''It is really painful.'' ''At this moment we feel that we are not part of India,'' said an indignant Syed Akbar Ali Shah, 65, a former porter for the Indian Army. It is in times of catastrophe, as opposed to war, that relations between a nation's soldiers and its citizens can matter most. And in this part of the world, which is among the most militarized anywhere, how the Pakistani and Indian governments respond will certainly be seen as a test of their commitment to the people of Kashmir. ''We thought this would have been an opportunity, would have given a boost to the peace process, would have narrowed the gulf,'' said Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, a Muslim religious leader who leads a coalition of Kashmiri separatist groups called the Hurriyet Conference. ''It hasn't happened. That's unfortunate.'' As the despair over relief supplies shows, there is not much love lost for the Indian Army in Indian-held Kashmir. Still, it has been widely credited there for its initial rescue efforts, including the loss of a half-dozen of its men in one operation on Wednesday. Even Mr. Farooq acknowledged their sacrifice. ''The army especially did help our people in far-flung areas,'' he said. But he was quick to add: ''The presence of the Army itself is not acceptable to Kashmiris.'' That earthquake operations could buy good will among the populace was not lost on Indian troops. The spokesman for the Indian Army, Col. Hemant Juneja, said his soldiers began rescue operations within hours of the quake. More than 40 soldiers lost their lives, he said, and he offered an inventory of all that the military had delivered to survivors, including 18,000 food ration packs, 20,000 pairs of warm pants, 10,000 pairs of winter socks, 51,100 coats, 15,400 waterproof windbreakers, 5,400 mattresses, 3,200 blankets, 3,000 tents. ''It should show the Indian Army's humane face to the civil population, that despite our casualties, despite our damage, the love and affection for the local population is there,'' the colonel said. Indeed, the potential payoff could be large. Good will among civilians could be a key to gathering intelligence, which in turn could be a key to the Indian Army's counterinsurgency drive. On the Pakistani side of the line, the harshest criticism of the government has centered on its initial response. After the quake struck, military officials and the military-dominated government played down its size. Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz said in an interview later that the earthquake had severed communication, cut the main road to Muzaffarabad and made it impossible to assess the impact swiftly. Four hundred casualties among the army slowed the response, he said. Where an army dominates a country, it is also easy to blame. It breeds both expectations and suspicion. Today in Pakistan, generals wield enormous power, military intelligence dominates all corners of government, and private companies attached to army welfare funds own everything from housing tracts to bottled water companies. But in the days after the quake, Mr. Nasir and others asked where the army was. It was villagers living less than a two-hour drive from an army base who were digging out the dead with their bare hands. A few days later, relief was flowing but there were no soldiers to regulate traffic leading up to the hardest-hit areas in the north. The road was choked with trucks and vans carrying bananas, blankets and anxious relatives. As relief trickled in, the people shivered another night in the hills."
"The death toll from the earthquake in South Asia a week ago has risen to 38,000, with 62,000 people injured, as more bodies have been pulled from the rubble, the senior military spokesman for Pakistan, Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan, said Saturday. President Pervez Musharraf warned that the toll was likely to increase even more as recovery teams reached the more remote towns and villages. ''I think it will keep rising when we go into the valleys,'' he said. In India, 1,350 people have died, The Associated Press reported. In Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir and one of the most damaged towns in the region, doctors warned that many more people were going to die because of the lack of medical facilities in the earthquake zone and the long delays in transporting victims to medical care. ''There's nowhere to put the patients,'' said Dr. Dominique Gladin, of the French nongovernmental aid group Service d'Aide Médicale Urgente, which has a team of 47 in Muzaffarabad. ''The urgent cases are operated on immediately and then put back on helicopters to be sent to Islamabad,'' Dr. Gladin said. ''But it's not good. I'm afraid many more are going to die.'' Thousands of injured people have arrived here, on helicopters bringing people in from remote villages, but also by ambulances, private cars and on the backs of their relatives who have carried them over landslides and blocked roads to reach help. A Pakistani military helicopter crashed in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, killing six military personnel on board, Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan, chief military spokesman, said Sunday morning. The helicopter was carrying relief items to a remote village northeast of Bagh when it went down on Saturday. All six bodies have been recovered, he said. ''It could have been bad weather, or a technical fault,'' he said. Heavy clouds and rain delayed helicopter flights to remote villages on both Saturday and Sunday morning, and aid workers said they remained fearful of conditions for the unknown number of injured still trapped in the mountains. Yet in Muzaffarabad, there are just six hospital beds -- in a French military surgical unit set up in a tent on the grounds of the town's principal hospital -- and those beds were full on Saturday. ''It's a drop in the ocean,'' Dr. Gladin said. Other international organizations are scrambling to set up field hospitals. The World Health Organization put out an urgent appeal for more medical personnel and more field hospitals. Pakistani surgeons were joined by an Indonesian team in another makeshift field hospital across town in a campsite set up by a Pakistani relief organization. Patients sleep in a tents pitched on stony ground. Twenty-six hospitals have been destroyed or are considered to be too hazardous to keep open, and most of the 600 health clinics in the earthquake affected areas are also thought to have been destroyed or severely damaged, the W.H.O. said in a statement this week. Double or triple the number of medical personnel sent so far are urgently needed, the organization said. The Combined Military Hospital, a military-run hospital which catered mainly to the civilian population of Muzaffarabad and the whole province, is completely out of action. Most of the buildings collapsed like a house of cards, including the three-story maternity ward and the canteen, both of which were full of people. The smell emanating from the maternity ward indicates that the bodies of women and children who died inside are still there. Two hundred people died here, including many medical personnel and their families, said Col. Iqbal Hanif Orakzai, the commanding officer. The two French medical emergency teams here, one civilian and one military, have set up on the lawns and concrete forecourt to start operating. Yet they still do not have a post-operative tent, and so have nowhere to put their patients. The lack of hospital beds in the town is even more stark at the helidrome, where helicopters drop off patients for first aid and assessment, and take the priority cases to hospitals in Islamabad, Abbottabad and Mansehra. Pakistani military surgeons are operating in a small building on the corner of the field, and patients lie in lines on the ground at the foot of the stairs waiting to be seen. Lines of patients lie on the grass around the edges of the field, with taped signs on their heads, indicating the gravity of their condition: III means they are a priority for a helicopter out; II or I can mean a wait of up to 24 hours in the open. Lying at the far end of the field was Adil, 18, waiting with his brother Arsalan, 10, who had broken his back and lost movement in his right leg. They had come from their village of Sharian on Friday, where they said 400 had died and more than 1,000 were injured. They carried Arsalan for about three miles to a site where a helicopter was landing. It would only take the children, Adil said. ''The doctors said he needs surgery,'' he said, ''and he cannot be treated here.''"
"As a powerful earthquake struck Saturday at the epicenter of one of the world's most stubborn border conflicts, questions emerged about the degree to which it would jolt India and Pakistan into a lasting reconciliation. The 7.6-magnitude quake sent tremors across much of South Asia and punched through the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir. On Monday, in a gesture of neighborly solidarity remarkable only because of the two countries involved, Pakistan said it would accept an Indian offer of relief. India announced that it would send those items that Pakistan has said it needs: tents, blankets, plastic sheets, food and medicines. India had also offered helicopters to assist with rescue efforts -- something that Pakistan has said it badly needs -- but on this, Pakistan demurred. There was also no suggestion from Pakistan that it would accept joint military rescue operations. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Tasneem Aslam, emphasized late Monday evening that neither Indian troops nor helicopters would be involved in the relief operation. ''We have received assistance from many countries, and many rescue teams are working here,'' she said in a telephone interview. ''We are not expecting any more rescue teams, as our requirement right now is the movement and transfer of relief supplies.'' India and Pakistan, torn apart at independence from British rule in 1947 and both nuclear powers today, have fought three wars since then, two over Kashmir, which they both claim. An anti-Indian insurgency has been under way on the Indian side of Kashmir since 1989; New Delhi accuses Islamabad of fueling it, a charge Pakistan denies. ''Pakistan's acceptance of aid from India reflects a major policy departure in India-Pak relations,'' Amitabh Mattoo, a native of Kashmir and vice chancellor at Jammu University on the Indian-controlled side, said late Monday. ''It augurs well for the peace process. It is not a temporary act of one-upmanship. I think it will lead to a lasting process.'' The disaster presents both countries with a critical test of credibility among their Kashmiri citizens. The two countries, since stepping away from the brink of war in 2002, have been engaged in snail's-pace peace talks whose goal is to build confidence between the sides and ultimately to resolve the question of what to do with Kashmir. Trade and tourism has inched up in recent years. Transportation links have been extended, including a bus service begun with great fanfare last April, allowing people to travel between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad for the first time in a half-century. (The service was indefinitely postponed Monday because of quake damage, the state-run Press Trust of India reported.) The two have also promised measures intended to temper the chance of conflict, namely agreeing to warn each other before nuclear tests and setting up a hot line between their foreign ministers. The nuclear test promise has not been kept; the hot line was used after the earthquake. The more trenchant issues remain unresolved. A neutral expert has been called in to negotiate a dispute over the construction of a dam across a river that crosses from India into Pakistan. Talks about a troop pullout from the disputed territory, Siachen Glacier, looked close to completion recently, only to become bogged down in details. India has said it will agree to a troop reduction in Kashmir only if militant violence diminishes. India has repeatedly said it will not entertain the notion of giving up what it considers to be its territory. The Indian foreign secretary, Shyam Saran, told reporters in New Delhi on Monday evening that India had also offered to send relief, perhaps by foot, across the Line of Control, or L.O.C., as it is known here, to villages difficult for Pakistani authorities to reach. Pakistan has not agreed to the proposal. ''If there is any requirement, they will certainly come back to us,'' Mr. Saran said. ''What I can tell you is that there is a very good atmosphere of mutual help at the L.O.C. itself and very good understanding.'' Correction: October 19, 2005, Wednesday Two articles on Oct. 11 about the earthquake that struck India and Pakistan on Oct. 8 misstated the ownership of the Press Trust of India, a main source of initial information on casualties and damage. (The error also occurred in unrelated articles on April 18, and May 26.) The news agency is a nonprofit cooperative owned by India's newspapers, not state-owned or state-run."
"A full two weeks after the earthquake upended everything, the tide of horror here remains largely unchanged. That is perhaps the most frightening thing of all. In this smashed-up village in the Kaghan Valley, now reachable only by helicopter, the able-bodied still wait for tents. The wounded continue to pour down from the hills. The Pakistani Army continues to airlift them to hospitals across the country. And though their numbers are lower than they were a week ago, their conditions in some cases are graver. For two weeks, wounds have festered. Relatively mild injuries have worsened, infections have set in and, in the worst cases, so have gangrene and tetanus. In some cases, doctors say, limbs that would not have required amputation had they received immediate care will now have to go. If a toll of more than 53,000 killed and 75,000 injured were not enough, doctors and relief workers say now the second wave of deaths has begun. The biggest hazards at the moment ''are untreated wounds,'' said Krist Teirlinck, the head of the Belgian mission of the medical relief group Doctors Without Borders. On Friday morning, more than 100 men, wrapped in shawls, showing the signs of 13 nights spent outside, stood politely in line for a tent. Syed Tasneem Shah said he had come here every day for the last 10 days. He had a 1-year-old baby to care for. His wife and elder daughter were dead, his mother badly wounded. ''They just say, wait, it will come today, it will come tomorrow,'' Mr. Shah recounted. He waited another day. The problem is not only the shortage of help; it is the magnitude of the destruction, and time is the enemy. The aid group, Action Contre le Faim, or Action Against Hunger, landed here Thursday but it only had 30 tents. Medical teams have not a single helicopter to use. [With three million made homeless, United Nations officials estimated Saturday a shortfall of up to 200,000 tents, not counting those in the pipeline but yet to be delivered. The United Nations resident coordinator in Pakistan, Jan Vandermootele, told reporters in Islamabad that relief had not reached about 10 to 20 percent of those affected, and that 50 more helicopters were urgently needed. Beyond shelter and medical aid, United Nations officials said they also needed to ferry food to remote villages before the snows cut them off entirely. One million displaced people will have to be fed for the next six months, they estimated.] [In New Delhi, Indian officials on Saturday said they were closer to what would be an extraordinary agreement on opening the Line of Control that runs through the disputed territory of Kashmir. India had earlier proposed three points through which relief aid could be sent from the Indian to the Pakistani side of Kashmir, which was heavily affected by the quake. Late Saturday, a statement from the Indian External Affairs Ministry said that Pakistan had suggested five crossing points, but that the two proposals ''can be reconciled.'' It added, ''We are ready to engage in discussions between our two Foreign Offices on these modalities and reach an early decision.'' The opening could occur as soon as Tuesday.] The snow will come to Paras in less than three weeks. Landslides have already washed away the road to the nearest town, Balakot. The hills were tumbling down even Friday, throwing up vast clouds of red dust, making the river below a muddy red-brown. Nonetheless, Sabir Hussain, a onetime waiter in his late 20's, trekked down from Paras to a displaced persons camp being erected on a cornfield in Bassian village, near Balakot, on Friday afternoon. He brought his wife and two of their three children, ages 5 and 12. Where the third one had ended up, whether dead or alive, they still had no clue. But upon arrival and seeing a camp with neither latrines nor lights, Mr. Hussain's hopes were punctured like a balloon. ''Our little children will die here,'' he said. With 225 tents sent by Unicef, the United Nations children's agency, and another 775 expected, relief workers could not put them up fast enough. Women made makeshift cooking stoves of brick and straw. ''It will be extremely difficult, but what can we do?'' Ghulam Hasan, 45, a laborer, said of spending the winter in his tent. ''It's not strong enough.'' To reach this camp, he and his brothers had walked for two days, bearing his injured wife on a homemade stretcher. With them were 20 children belonging to their extended family, the youngest not even 3 years old. The dead had been left at home: his mother, sister and a niece. The army medical tent in Balakot received just 500 new patients on Friday, including 200 suffering from direct earthquake-related wounds, compared to the 1,500 patients a day it was taking in shortly after the quake. Among the new arrivals were 2 with broken backs, 10 with broken legs, 15 with broken arms, 15 with head injuries, and 150 with still-open wounds, all of them infected. Two patients would require amputations. Hospitals in and around Islamabad, where the most seriously injured are sent, have performed 165 amputations in the last 14 days. In Balakot, the commanding officer, Muhammad Younas, said eight tetanus cases had arrived in the last four days. ''That is my nightmare,'' he said. The World Health Organization said 72 cases of tetanus had been confirmed. After two measles cases were confirmed, Unicef began a drive Friday to vaccinate 800,000 children in the camps. At a makeshift hospital in Mansehra, the nearest big town, the reception desk registered patient number 1987 on Friday afternoon. The five beds in the surgical ward were full: an elderly woman with a broken tibia; a woman screaming as doctors extracted blood from a perilously large hematoma; a woman with a broken left leg; an elderly, stick-thin man with a head wound; and a 4-year-old girl, identified only as Aisha, whose left hand had been crushed by the rubble, and the open wound was now severely infected. In the hallway, Farhat Bibi, from Paras, waited. Her back was broken two weeks ago. Only after villagers had cleared the road with their hands and the most grievously injured brought out was it her turn to see a doctor. Only on Friday morning did she receive her first dose of pain killers."
"Airdrops of food, tents and other urgent aid to earthquake survivors will be suspended in a matter of days if there is not an immediate infusion of donations, the United Nations warned on Friday. Nearly three weeks after the Oct. 8 earthquake flattened entire cities and hamlets across northern Pakistan, killing more than 53,000 people and leaving up to three million homeless, humanitarian relief has been hamstrung by a severe shortage of funds. Of the $550 million that the United Nations says it needs, only 20 percent has been pledged, and an even smaller fraction has been delivered. The United Nations resident coordinator in Pakistan, Jan Vandemoortele, said Friday evening that nearly all of the money in hand had been spent, that emergency reserves had been exhausted and that some relief operations, notably those using helicopters, would have to stop in less than a week without new funds. With the mountains expected to be blanketed in snow in less than a month, the window for delivering aid is narrowing. Hundreds of thousands of families remain without tents. The World Food Program estimated Friday that it would have to help feed more than two million people this winter. Helicopters are the most expensive items in the relief operations, and they are vital for reaching mountain villages where roads have been blocked by landslides. Mr. Vandemoortele said the flights would have to stop within ''four to five days.'' None of the predictions on Friday were optimistic. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that up to 30 percent of the quake-affected areas had yet to receive aid. The International Organization for Migration reported it still needed 200,000 tents, about a third of the total required. According to Reuters, the World Meteorological Organization told reporters in Geneva that studies predicted an unusually cold winter. The growing sense of urgency seemed to have little effect on discussions under way between India and Pakistan to open their disputed frontier in Kashmir. The two countries have exchanged proposals and counterproposals over the past week about how best to help Kashmiris affected by the earthquake. Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has called for opening the de facto boundary, the Line of Control, to allow survivors to cross over and assist in relief efforts, while India has suggested setting up medical relief tents on its side of the disputed frontier."
"On Thursday, Dr. Ali Shehada took a short hike outside this mountain town to explore the disturbing reports from his patients: Nearly three weeks after an earthquake devastated northern Pakistan, injured women still lay in nearby villages with untreated wounds. Dr. Shehada, a 30-year-old Egyptian-American emergency room doctor, quickly found what he had feared. Less than two miles from where he had been treating patients for days, a 25-year-old woman lay in her village with an untreated broken femur. He also found a 55-year-old woman who had been suffering from bloody diarrhea for three days. Dr. Shehada, who treated Hurricane Katrina victims in Houston, said he was overwhelmed. ''What we're seeing -- it's like you've got a bleeding wound and you're putting a Band-Aid on it,'' he said. Doctors and health officials say that in the wake of the Oct. 8 earthquake, which killed 55,000 people, they are encountering something they have never seen before: hundreds of injured victims in remote areas in need of immediate evacuation and treatment. ''Normally, three weeks after an earthquake, people are generally dead or they're O.K.,'' said Rachel Lavy, the World Health Organization official coordinating medical relief. ''But three weeks after this earthquake, we're still having severe injuries come in, open fractures, horrific infections, gangrene, tetanus.'' To meet the staggering demands, W.H.O. officials say, they have decided that instead of trying to bring the injured to medical care, they will try to bring the medical care to them, and hundreds of Pakistani and foreign doctors have fanned out into the mountains, by helicopter, by car and on foot, to set up rudimentary health clinics. The task is vast. Half the 564 hospitals and health clinics in a zone the size of Maryland were damaged or destroyed, according to Pakistani officials, and a new health network must be set up before winter, which comes early in the mountains. One of the doctors was Dr. Shehada, a soft-spoken young man with a calming manner. The doctor, a native of Maryland, reached this resort town by hiking seven hours through landslides that block the only road to the Neelum Valley, an area with an estimated population of 150,000 people. Some boulders that cover the road are so enormous that they cannot be removed with bulldozers. Dr. Shehada said that since he arrived here on Oct. 21, he and four other members of the British-based medical group Doctors Worldwide have treated 80 to 90 patients a day, and have evacuated 10 seriously injured patients a day by helicopter. ''A lot of fractures, deep wounds and deep cuts,'' he said. ''All of them were infected.'' At the same time, concerns about disease are rising. ''We are starting to see the first cases of nausea and diarrhea,'' Dr. Shehada said. ''There are dead bodies in the water supply.'' His group will soon be replaced by doctors from the Finnish Red Cross, who are setting up a mobile primary health care center. Made up of a half-dozen tents with enough supplies to treat 30,000 patients, the new center will remain here through the winter. Ms. Lavy, of the W.H.O., said that roughly 40 clinics had been opened in northern Pakistan, but that at least 100 are needed, and it is unlikely they will have funds for more. The Pakistan aid effort remains woefully underfunded, she said. To date, the United States and other wealthy nations have pledged only 20 percent of the $550 million the United Nations requested for Pakistan. ''It's scary,'' Dr. Shehada said. ''Very scary.'' Correction: November 17, 2005, Thursday An article on Nov. 1 about the many victims of the Oct. 8 Kashmir earthquake who remained untreated misspelled the surname of an Egyptian-American emergency room doctor who was in the region helping victims. He is Ali Shehata, not Shehada."
"The government of Pakistan exceeded its financing target to rebuild its earthquake shattered north, as delegates from 75 donor nations and institutions gathered here on Saturday and promised to open their purse strings to the tune of $5.8 billion for long-term reconstruction. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank pledged $1 billion each. With a promise to dole out $573 million, Saudi Arabia turned out to be the biggest contributing country, followed by the United States, which announced a pledge of $510 million, nearly tripling what it has already promised for earthquake relief. Washington's commitment includes a target of $100 million from the private sector. Pakistan's neighbor and archrival, India, has promised $25 million. The Pakistani prime minister, Shaukat Aziz, told reporters after the donor conference that the $5.827 billion pledged included soft loans, cash and in-kind donations. How much of it is new money, separate from what was already pledged for relief operations, has yet to be determined. ''This was a very successful day for Pakistan,'' which had hoped for $5.2 billion, he said. The reconstruction pledges are to pay for the government's efforts to repair schools, hospitals, and roads and, in some cases, rebuild entire towns. The Pakistani president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, told donors here that his government would offer cash and engineering guidance to enable the homeless to rebuild their houses. The Oct. 8 earthquake killed more than 73,000 people and rendered an estimated 500,000 families homeless. General Musharraf promised accountability as the money is spent. He also called on India to deliver political relief on the feud between the countries over Kashmir, the Himalayan province that India and Pakistan claim and the region hit hardest by the earthquake. ''Let this be the Indian donation to Kashmir,'' he said. The Indian minister of state for external affairs, E. Ahamed, countered that his country could ''resolve all issues'' as long as there was ''an atmosphere free from terrorism and violence.'' India blames Pakistan for giving guns and training to militants fighting Indian rule in Kashmir. The success of the long-term reconstruction financing drive stands in stark contrast to the United Nations' appeal for emergency relief aid: five weeks after the fact, barely 30 percent of the $550 million that the United Nations requested has been promised by foreign donors. In the heart of the earthquake zone, north of the comforts of the donors' conference, winter snow and clouds are expected to cut off more than 200,000 earthquake survivors in high altitude villages from most outside aid in two to three weeks, aid workers said. Men are demanding tools to rebuild their homes and save their families from cold, slow deaths. ''There is no road, there is no transportation system, there is no communications system,'' said Sherafat Hussain, whose hamlet can now be reached only by helicopter. ''Death is dancing everywhere.'' Five weeks after the earthquake in northern Pakistan, one of the most complex relief operations ever mounted remains short of cash and under enormous strain. Aid workers and Pakistani officials say progress has been made, but their efforts may still not be enough to prevent thousands of earthquake survivors from perishing in freezing winter weather. ''The more we go on, the more we see that needs to be done,'' said Jessica Barry of the International Committee of the Red Cross. ''We still feel we are racing against time.'' Across a mountainous area the size of Maryland, dozens of bulldozers, more than 100 helicopters and tens of thousands of Pakistani soldiers have created one of the most complex, expensive and fragile relief supply chains ever established. Dozens of helipads, field hospitals and supply depots now dot a rugged area closed to the outside world six weeks ago. Signs of progress are clear. After a helicopter shortage slowed initial rescue efforts, aid workers now say they have enough for their mission. Pakistani military engineers are clearing roads faster than expected. And after warning of a severe shortage of tents, United Nations officials say they are ''cautiously optimistic'' that 500,000 tents, enough to shelter 3.2 million homeless survivors, will arrive before winter. Yet dangers persist. The sprawling United Nations relief operation remains grossly underfinanced, with little that has been promised actually in hand. Hundreds of cases of acute diarrhea have emerged in small, poorly organized refugee camps that have sprouted across the quake zone. The most unpredictable element of all, an early or particularly harsh winter, could scuttle the entire effort and kill thousands. In the next two weeks, the relief effort must achieve two critical goals, Pakistani officials and foreign aid workers said. It must provide adequate shelter to 200,000 people living in high altitude villages soon to be cut off by snow. And it must organize, improve and sanitize hundreds of small refugee camps that have sprung up in low-lying areas. For now, many survivors say they will spend the winter in damaged villages instead of refugee camps. Zahid Shah, a bearish, leather-skinned man in Missri Mar, an Allai Valley village that sits at 6,100 feet, said he would take his chances in the mountains. ''Last year, there was 15 feet of snow, and the road was blocked for six months,'' he boasted. ''But we survived.'' The establishment of 15 remote field hospitals has lessened one of the most harrowing legacies of the earthquake -- hundreds of adults and children in isolated villages receiving no medical care for weeks for broken spines, legs and arms, aid workers say. Yet doctors say that each week they encounter seriously injured quake survivors who have still received no medical care. On Monday, Red Cross workers discovered three girls, ages 10, 5 and 3, and six adults, including two men and a woman over 70, in the Jhelum Valley who had received no medical care for limbs fractured in the quake, Ms. Barry said. No major disease outbreaks have occurred, but health experts remain concerned. More than 9,000 acute respiratory infections, and 6,000 cases of diarrhea, 1,130 of dysentery, 444 of scabies and hundreds of pneumonia cases were identified, the World Health Organization said. Even if additional deaths are avoided, statistics reveal Pakistan's loss. More than 17,000 children perished in the earthquake, Unicef said, most of them crushed when the concrete roofs of shoddy schools collapsed. More than 1,000 amputations have been performed, the Pakistani Ministry of Health said. At least 504 people have been paralyzed. One hundred and eleven of those paralyzed were children."
"Tucked inside a popular bazaar, there once was a place where women shimmied their hips in full Technicolor splendor. Today, it is a refuge for women who can barely lift their legs. It is an odd transformation, wrought by the devastating earthquake on Oct. 8. The Melody Cinema had sat fallow for two years, ever since a mob of religious radicals set it on fire and reduced it to nothing more than a charred, trash-filled shell. Today, it has been reborn as the Melody Relief and Rehabilitation Center, and the occupants of its 53 beds are women with broken backs. The youngest patient is 13, the oldest 50. Most of the others are in their 20's and 30's, women who had been cooking and cleaning at home when the earth shook and roofs collapsed. They have all undergone surgery for spinal-cord injuries, and the Melody is a way station of sorts, a place to rest and recover before returning to their homes or whatever is left of them. Their futures are full of uncertainty. Even if they can get into a wheelchair, how will they survive in the terraced hills back home? If they are destined to be paralyzed for life, how will they take care of their homes and families? Among the married patients, there is this aching question: Will their husbands abandon them for an able-bodied woman? Among the unmarried, another agony: What man will have them now? It is not just their backs that are broken. Nafisa Inayat, the owner who refashioned the cinema, is keenly aware that spirits have also suffered. The other evening, in between visiting hours and dinnertime, Ms. Inayat marched over to Bed 30 and ordered its occupant, a 33-year-old named Arshad Begum, to sit up and slide her swollen feet into a pair of slippers. Then, standing with her legs spread at hip's width, Ms. Inayat held out her hands and told Arshad to breathe deeply and stand. ''Hold my hands, let's go,'' Ms. Inayat said quietly. Arshad closed her eyes, took long, purposeful breaths and hoisted herself up, quivering. ''In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful,'' Ms. Inayat murmured. Arshad's 13-year-old daughter, Nadia, stood nearby and stared, brows knit, eyes wide. She is now her mother's main caretaker. Arshad's husband died in the earthquake. He was found inside their house, bent over himself as though in prayer. Two of their daughters also died. There are seven children left, and only one is old enough to make a living. He works in a sweet shop. ''Repeat after me,'' Ms. Inayat commanded. ''I will do it. I will have to look after my children. I will have to look after my house.'' ''I take God's name,'' Arshad whispered. ''After that, the doctor's name. After that, your name.'' Arshad was crying. The woman lying in bed to her right was crying. So was the woman in bed to her left. The entire room had fallen quiet. All eyes were on Arshad, who sat back down on her bed, took Ms. Inayat's right hand and kissed it softly. It was the first time in six weeks that she had stood on her own feet. ''Shabash,'' Ms. Inayat said in praise. ''God will not put food in your mouth if you keep sitting. You have to stand on your own.'' The quake injured at least 128,000 men and women, more than half seriously. The government counts 558 paraplegics among them. More than 73,000 people were killed. Two beds to the right of Arshad, a woman named Sabjan, 30, squeezed a ball in her left hand. It was her daily physical therapy, intended to strengthen her forearms. Watching Arshad stand up, Sabjan said, was bittersweet. Her 7-year-old son was killed as he ran into the house out of fear. Six other children survived. Loss hangs in the air. ''Only your body is left, and that too is paralyzed,'' Ms. Inayat said. The women are learning how to insert a catheter, how to strengthen their arms to maneuver a wheelchair, how to embroider or read to keep themselves occupied, and perhaps how to make a modest living. Volunteers come every day to help. The full-time staff includes nurses, cooks, sweepers, two doctors and a psychotherapist. The operation is fully financed by charitable contributions, and it costs at least $200 a month to sustain each patient. There is no telling how long the women will have to stay here. On the second floor, home to the most seriously injured patients, a woman named Afshan has just begun feeling sensation in her toes. Bushra, 20, can barely move one leg. Shahnaz, 20, feels a burning sensation in her limbs, but her legs are still numb to the touch. None of them can sit up, and whether they ever will remains a mystery. The downstairs patients are sitting up in bed. They will go home soon after they start walking."
"With great fanfare 10 days ago, Indian and Pakistani officials agreed to allow people from the earthquake-devastated areas of Kashmir to cross the Line of Control, the heavily militarized boundary between the countries, to comfort family members on the other side. On Wednesday, at this isolated crossing point, between the Pakistani-controlled town of Chakothi and the Indian-controlled town of Uri, not a single Kashmiri crossed the border. Instead, smiling Indian and Pakistani officials exchanged several hundred sacks of aid, posed for photographs and congratulated themselves on taking a ''step in the right direction.'' ''We wanted to go to the other side and read prayers for the dead and to give moral support to survivors,'' said Ghulam Kadir, an 80-year-old Kashmiri man on the Indian side of the boundary whose sister, brother-in-law and son-in-law perished on the Pakistani side in the epic Oct. 8 earthquake. ''At least during this period, both governments should have made the crossing easy.'' Nothing, not even the death of more than 74,000 people in what Mr. Kadir called a ''divine catastrophe,'' appears to have made relations between India and Pakistan easy. A full month after the earthquake killed 73,000 people in Pakistan and 1,300 in India, officials from the two countries continue to blame each other for yet another cheerless chapter in their decades-old dispute over Kashmir, a beautiful Himalayan region claimed by both sides. The cause of the current delay is the failure of the two sides to exchange lists of Kashmiris who want to cross the Line of Control. Each side fears that the other will use the opening to slip spies and insurgents into its territory. ''We have not received a list from Pakistan,'' said L. Sreeramulu, a regional passport officer on the Indian side of the boundary. Lt. Col. Shiragh Haider, a Pakistani Army officer, said, ''We asked yesterday to exchange the list; they said no.'' [On Thursday, no Kashmiris crossed the border either. Indian officials said they had sent a list to their Pakistani counterparts; Pakistani officials denied receiving it.] For 58 years, the Line of Control has divided tens of thousands of Kashmiri families. When Indian and Pakistani troops are not sniping or hurling shells at each other, divided Kashmiri parents, children and siblings sometimes gather here, where the border consists only of a narrow river, and wave, shout greetings and throw small gifts to one another. Since they won independence from Britain in 1947, India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, making this one of the world's most intractable and dangerous standoffs, as both now have nuclear arms. India has accused Pakistan of training, arming and financing militants who have waged a separatist insurgency on the Indian side of Kashmir since 1989. Pakistan denies the charge and accuses India of wanton killings and gross human rights abuses. Estimates of the number of dead in the fighting range from 40,000 to 70,000. In the days after the quake, when certain areas were more easily accessible from the other side of the Line of Control, the locked-down border became a humanitarian issue. An Oct. 30 agreement appeared to resolve that issue, as well as herald a new era. Five crossing points along the Line of Control were to open this past Monday to allow for civilian crossings and the exchange of relief goods. The agreement built on a fragile peace effort India and Pakistan have been carrying out, in fits and starts, since January 2004. A cease-fire along the Line of Control has held for two years. Since the five crossing points were announced, roughly 950 Kashmiris on the Indian side of the boundary and 2,000 Kashmiris on the Pakistani side have applied for permits to cross, according to officials. In addition, roughly 60 passengers of a new bus service who had crossed the border and were visiting relatives when the earthquake struck remain stranded, according to Pakistani and Indian officials. The two sides have been unable to agree on when the 60 can return home. On Monday, the depth of Kashmiri frustration emerged. At the opening of the first new crossing point, between the Pakistani-controlled town of Rawalakot and the Indian-controlled town of Poonch, Indian and Pakistani officials exchanged symbolic relief supplies, but no Kashmiris were allowed to cross. Hundreds of Kashmiris grew angry and began chanting for Kashmir's independence. The police had to fire shots and tear gas into the air to disperse the crowd. On Wednesday here, Indian officials appeared to try to one-up their Pakistani colleagues, offering 1,000 bags of relief supplies compared with Pakistan's 50 or so. After the ceremony, Kashmiris on both sides seethed. Outside Pakistani-controlled Chakothi, Khawajjah Attullah, a 70-year-old stranded bus passenger, said he was desperate to return home and say prayers for his grandson who died in the quake. ''We blame both of them equally,'' he said, referring to Pakistan and India. ''They are settling disputes on their own and not caring about us.''"
"No buildings have collapsed, yet. No one has been hurt. But the case of the architect caught cheating on earthquake building codes has transfixed Japan. Night after night, television news programs feature video clips of tearful condominium owners moving out of their new apartments, while construction company owners, inspectors and the architect involved in the deficient buildings blame one another for the failings. So far, seven hotels have been forced to close, including a 260-room tower that opened in August near the Tokyo Stock Exchange. ''It's not entirely my fault,'' Hidetsugu Aneha, the architect, told reporters last week. To cut construction costs and win more commissions, authorities say, Mr. Aneha designed 21 buildings over the last decade that would not withstand a moderate earthquake. Working in almost half of Japan's 47 prefectures, Mr. Aneha had a hand in nearly 200 structures, largely apartment buildings, but also hotels and temples. In one 11-story condominium complex studied this week by the newspaper Asahi Shimbun, columns and steel reinforcing bars were found to be too thin and too far apart, and different earthquake force figures were used for the same floor. The report for this Tokyo building, the newspaper said, was ''filled with inconsistencies that any expert could easily have picked up.'' The scandal, which many fear could spread even further, strikes at a core insecurity for many Japanese. Located atop four tectonic plates, Japan is exceptionally prone to earthquakes. A decade ago, a severe temblor flattened sections of the port of Kobe, killing about 6,000 people. After that, the country tightened its already strict building codes, leading many Japanese to believe that they live in the world's most earthquake-safe nation. ''With the Kobe earthquake, we saw high-rises pancaking, the highway keeling over, we learned builders had used wood instead of steel reinforcing bars,'' said Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Temple University Japan. ''We live in a earthquake hot zone, and so it is imperative that the government strictly enforce building standards.'' It now appears that corners were cut as the construction industry struggled to reduce costs as it coped with a deflationary economy and a stagnant population. ''I felt pressure from the industry's overall trend to seek speed and low cost,'' Mr. Aneha told reporters, according to Kyodo News. ''I didn't feel I was doing anything wrong, and I was too busy to sense any feeling like that.'' The architect defended his buildings. But under questioning by reporters, he conceded that in a medium-sized earthquake, ''they might crumble.'' One construction company is planning to file for bankruptcy next week, as a result of the scandal. Others are reeling under the pressure of financing the costs of demolishing or repairing defective high-rise condominiums. Government officials now are focusing on the private companies that were contracted to review architectural plans. Under a system established in 1999, architectural firms won the right to choose the companies that inspect their building plans. Government officials now say that inspection companies that gave quick, cursory checks won the most business. ''Everybody involved, developers, original architects, construction companies, knows about the cheating because it is a system,'' Takayoshi Igarashi, an urban policy professor at Hosei University, said in an interview. ''Since 1999, about two million buildings have been built with inspection by private sector inspectors, and it probably was not just Aneha who cheated.'' But some see the investigation as a sign of progress. ''The fact that this story came out before anybody died, before any building collapsed, while buildings were under construction, to me that is an encouraging sign,'' said Mr. Kingston, whose recent book, ''Japan's Quiet Transformation,'' talks about growing government transparency and accountability in Japan."
"In a country with such a long tradition of military rule, it is hardly surprising to see the Pakistani Army dominate every aspect of earthquake relief, from evacuating the wounded and distributing desperately sought-after tents to erecting camps for the displaced. But with that kind of reach comes considerable risk for the army, the country's most powerful institution, and the head of state, Gen. Pervez Musharraf. If relief is not distributed efficiently or fairly -- or at least perceived to be -- General Musharraf's government will feel the heat. Already, some of his most vociferous critics have positioned themselves to compete with the army's relief machinery. The militant Islamist political party, Jamaat-e-Islami, is feeding, housing and clothing survivors. Two things make General Musharraf's handling of the quake particularly delicate. First, the army was perceived to be slow in its initial response when the earthquake struck Oct. 8. Second, the people of Kashmir are the most gravely affected. This disputed province remains the central source of competition and conflict between Pakistan and its nuclear rival, neighboring India. That made all the more resonant the bitterness expressed by Razia Begum, as she shivered in the darkness recently in Bagh, a flattened town in Kashmir. One of her daughters was dead; seven surviving children were losing weight; her only shelter, nearly three weeks after the quake leveled her home, was a patchwork tent of plastic sheets and cloth. Ms. Begum, a wizened woman of 45, was not in an isolated village in the hills, but in Bagh, a heavily militarized town reachable by road since the day after the quake. Three military camps are within two miles of her former home. Ms. Begum accused the soldiers in those camps of hoarding tents and other aid. ''They give it to people who they know,'' she said, as her neighbors nodded in agreement. ''They don't give anything to us.'' The Pakistani Army's traditional state of distrust with India seems not to have been buried under the quake's rubble. Neither India nor Pakistan appears ready to put bitterness behind it. Under pressure from Kashmiris, they did agree to open the disputed de facto Kashmir frontier -- for relief -- but so far they have barred Kashmiris from stepping across the line. It is still premature to say whether the Pakistani Army's handling of earthquake relief will be judged a success or a failure. In some parts of the quake zone, survivors simmer with anger at the army. In others, they are forgiving. Still elsewhere, soldiers and citizens face off in desperation and trauma. In a village in the far-flung Allai Valley in northwest Pakistan nearly three weeks after the quake, a cranky, disheveled man hectored the commanding officer in his village for tents and blankets, only to have a soldier wave a stick in his face and order him to leave. The man was defiant. ''Where do you want me to go?'' he yelled. The depth of the United States' support for General Musharraf, who took power in 1999 in a bloodless coup, is also being tested. As a reward for being a vital partner in Mr. Bush's campaign against terrorism, American officials have promised Pakistan $3 billion in aid, rescheduled $3 billion in debt and canceled an additional $1 billion in debt. Yet since the quake, the United States has offered Pakistan $156 million in aid, including military equipment, deployed 950 soldiers and sent 24 helicopters. After the Indian Ocean tsunami last year the United States sent nearly $1 billion in government aid, 16,000 soldiers, 57 helicopters, 42 other aircraft and 25 ships. According to The Chronicle of Philanthropy, Americans have given $13.1 million in private donations. Americans gave 10 times as much for the tsunami -- $1.3 billion -- and roughly $2 billion for hurricane Katrina. Last week, President Bush convened a panel of American business leaders to raise additional money for earthquake survivors. The United States, Europe and other wealthy nations have pledged less than 28 percent of the relief money the United Nations requested. On the ground in the quake zone, there is plenty of gratitude for aid from the United States and other countries that were less than popular among ordinary Pakistanis. But it is General Musharraf's government -- not any foreign nation -- that the citizenry will hold responsible. ''They will blame the government,'' said Rasul Baksh Rais, a professor at Lahore University of Management Sciences in Pakistan. ''The critical link between these people and aid is the government of Pakistan.'' General Musharraf has appointed military commanders to control virtually every aspect of the aid effort, ensuring that the army will be seen as responsible. The army's absences have also been noted. On the morning after the quake, as survivors picked with their bare hands through the rubble of a school for girls in Garhi Habibullah, there were no soldiers in sight and there was no hiding the people's rage. The army base was an hour's drive from the village, so why had the soldiers not come to help, they demanded to know. How many children could have been saved? Mohammed Akram Khan, the outraged father of a dead boy, cried. If General Musharraf's child lay under the rubble, he said, army helicopters would be overhead immediately. ''Whatever Musharraf is saying, whatever the prime minister is saying -- they are lies,'' he said. But such absences were at times met with more resignation than fury. In the third week after the quake, a group of men trekked from a marooned village in Neelam Valley to Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. Army helicopters had dropped sacks of aid, the men said, but they had fallen into ravines. Soldiers had evacuated some of the injured by helicopter but left many others. The men showed not anger, but sympathy. The quake killed at least 450 soldiers. At another camp, Ghulam Mohiuddin Butt, a civil servant, said of the army, ''They have helped us in our hour of need.'' In two weeks, the snow is expected to come with a vengeance, and relief efforts will be frozen in place. So, too, will Pakistani views of their government's credibility. News Analysis Correction: November 15, 2005, Tuesday A news analysis article yesterday about the Pakistani military role in earthquake relief misstated the comparison of American private donations for earthquake victims ($13.1 million) and for those in the tsunami of December 2004 ($1.3 billion). Tsunami relief was 100 times as much, not 10 times."
"THE center of town here is lively these days. Businesses are open and crowded. Markets are fully stocked and residents block the streets sifting through fruits, vegetables and meat. Hundreds of cars and motorbikes sit in traffic. At first sight this could be any Indonesian city. But looming in the background, and around every corner, are the hollow shells of houses, lingering debris and ghostly emptiness. Everywhere are the reminders of the tsunami that decimated a third of this city nearly a year ago. Desi Herlina, 24, emerged from the tent she has been living in for 10 months. Just across the dirt road lies the foundation of her old house and, hopefully soon, she said, her new one. ''It's O.K. living in this tent,'' she said. ''I only mind when the rains come. I think the development here is good even though you can't see many new houses yet.'' Indeed, in the last 10 months, aid organizations have managed to stave off disease, provide fresh water and sanitation, re-enroll children in school, rebuild hundreds of mosques, reconstruct roads and -- most impressively -- remove the debris blanketing the city. ''We had a huge beginning,'' said Sarah Lumsdon, program manager for Oxfam International, one of the largest nongovernment organizations working in Aceh. ''The emergency phase went very well. There wasn't the problem of disease that everyone expected, and the loss of life since the tsunami has been negligible.'' Despite these successes, the one thing noticeably still lacking is housing. About 60,000 refugees continue to live in tents. As the focus shifts from emergency to reconstruction, progress is slowing, and the hundreds of nongovernment organizations, or N.G.O.'s, along with multilateral donors like the United Nations and government agencies are struggling to get organized here. Care International told Ms. Herlina's family that her house would be built in February -- more than a year after the tsunami and well into the monsoon season. Unlike Ms. Herlina, other refugees are losing patience. Sabar Tanus, 39, who lost both his children in the tsunami, now waits for a house with several other men in temporary barracks. ''I am upset,'' he said, ''because there are so many N.G.O.'s here, with all this money, promising to build houses, but they haven't. Why is it taking so long?'' Americans alone gave aid groups more than $1 billion in private donations after the Dec. 26 tsunami, making these groups the leading source of financial aid, even more than the World Bank and the United Nations. Like the rest of the world, Americans were moved by the sheer magnitude of the disaster. In Aceh, about 130,000 people were killed and 30,000 are still missing. But it is the 500,000-plus homeless that is now the No. 1 concern here. As the one-year anniversary approaches, there is a strong drive to build temporary housing to move residents out of tents, a major policy shift. Original strategies were to keep people in tents until permanent housing could be arranged. But Scott Campbell, program manager for Catholic Relief Services, said organizations in Aceh misjudged just how mammoth a process rebuilding actually is. ''I think a lot of people thought this would happen faster,'' he said. ''Certainly people need to get out of tents, but when you look at the scale of this disaster -- it becomes a lot more complicated.'' One complication is the issue of sorting out who owns what. Officials worry about building tension into Aceh's future by not addressing ownership from the beginning. So a land title must be confirmed before a permanent house can go up. There are other problems as well. ''It takes ages to get all this done,'' Ms. Lumsdon said. ''It is longer than anyone expected because not only do you have to sort out land titles, but the land has to be appropriate and safe, the houses need to be structurally sound, and people have to like the designs,'' he said. ''Then there is the issue of getting the necessary timber to build such a large number of houses.'' Add maneuvering through four levels of local government and a recently settled 30-year civil war, and the complications reach a whole other level. ''I have never seen anything like it,'' said Mr. Campbell, who has worked on relief efforts all over the world. Building houses isn't the only thing slowing down since the emergency phase ended; reconstruction in general seems to have taken a step back -- using a moment to re-examine itself. Leroy Hollenbeck, an American adviser to the governor of Aceh, said there needed to be a serious look at the different organizations working in Aceh and, more important, how they are working together. Only in the last month has the Indonesian government's rehabilitation and reconstruction agency, known as BRR, begun to monitor and coordinate the projects being carried out by aid organizations. Meanwhile, larger nongovernment organizations complain that smaller, less-experienced agencies are not doing the necessary background research before starting projects, resulting in a misallocation of resources and confused residents. ''There are 300 nongovernment organizations in Aceh and half of them shouldn't be here,'' Mr. Hollenbeck said. ''There needs to be a screening process, an evaluation of the work being done and not being done.'' But as a government institution, BRR is inherently mistrusted by nongovernment organizations, and some of them are avoiding the agency altogether. Officials at the agency said those who did not register their projects would be asked to leave. Many aid organizations think this is an important step. ''There are so many N.G.O.'s here that it sometimes makes decisions difficult,'' Ms. Lumsdon said. ''BRR needs to register everyone's projects and hold them accountable.'' A turnover of staff at many of these organizations has not helped the situation. Hundreds of emotionally and physically exhausted relief workers left after six or eight months. And although energy has been restored, the turnover forced staff members to rebuild relationships -- further hampering any effort toward coordination. If there is any lesson to be learned from this relief effort, Mr. Hollenbeck said, it is the importance of early coordination and communication among national and local government, donors and nongovernment organizations. But he was quick to add that one can rebuild a city in a year. Many Acehnese are hopeful, glimpsing the future. ''Some people still live in tents,'' said Chairul Amri, a village leader in Aceh. ''But 50 percent of my community is living in permanent houses. We have a school and fresh water and a mosque. And many of us are working again. That's good.''"
"CRUNCHING the numbers on human despair is an undignified exercise. But here it is. The death toll from the Oct. 8 earthquake stands at just over 73,000, concentrated in two of Pakistan's northern provinces. A month into the disaster, donor nations had pledged slightly more than a fourth of the $550 million that the United Nations says it needs to deliver emergency relief. By contrast, the Indian Ocean tsunami less than a year ago left a trail of 200,000 dead. A month into that disaster, the world had pledged 99 percent of the United Nations' emergency appeal. Private donations by Americans totaled $13.1 million for earthquake victims, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy. In comparison, Americans doled out $1.3 billion for the tsunami victims and roughly $2 billion for their own after Hurricane Katrina. The response to the South Asian earthquake has raised a troubling question: In the face of such calamity, why is the world not doing more? George Rupp, president of the International Rescue Committee, rejects the easiest theory, donor fatigue. ''I think Westerners identified with the first photos that came in,'' he said, referring to images from the tsunami. ''I don't think it is donor fatigue. I think it is donor identification.'' As evidence, he pointed to far graver relief crises -- the war in Congo, for instance, which has killed 3.8 million people since 1998 -- that were underfinanced long before the recent disasters. The South Asian earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.6, struck a patch of earth as stunning as it is bloodstained, and it shook the mountains that divide the disputed Himalayan province of Kashmir. With a series of aftershocks and hundreds of landslides, it cracked mountains, washed away roads, broke bridges and marooned villagers who live close to the clouds. The earthquake left three million people homeless, three times the numbers displaced by the tsunami. The estimate of injured, as doctors painstakingly reach them, stands around 128,000. Delivering aid there is particularly expensive. In parts of the earthquake zone, food, blankets and doctors must be ferried by helicopters. The four Bell/Agusta AB139's donated by the Aga Khan Foundation cost $2,000 an hour to operate. As of last week, they had flown 438 hours, evacuated 1,036 wounded and conveyed 436.2 metric tons of supplies. The price of tents has gone up, as relief agencies try to procure a half-billion of them in time for winter. Nature's clock makes everything urgent: by Dec. 1, wintry weather will come and much of the higher reaches of the earthquake zone will fall beyond reach even by helicopter. How many people who have died from injuries because there were not enough helicopters to get them to a hospital remains unknown. The bigger mystery is how many may not survive the winter because of hunger, cold or disease. Many theories besides Mr. Rupp's are offered for the meager donor response. Jan Egeland, the United Nations' emergency relief coordinator, offers two. First, he says, the world did not see television images of how the houses came tumbling down on people, and did not understand the scope of the disaster. Second, he says, donor nations were at the end of their budget cycles when the earthquake hit; the tsunami, because it struck on Dec. 26 last year, came at the front end of the 2005 budget cycle. ''We peaked, in a way, during the tsunami, when half of the world's nations became donors, and 500 international relief groups participated,'' Mr. Egeland said. ''Now maybe there is a danger that we will compare everything to the tsunami, which was unique.'' Never mind the other calamities -- whether created by humans or nature -- that United Nations aid workers have faced this year, with even less largess: an agricultural crisis that blew up into famine in West Africa, more than two million displaced by civil war in the Darfur region of Sudan and a food crisis in southern Africa. In the succession of emergencies, it has fallen on Mr. Egeland to range across the world's rich nations with a begging bowl in one hand and a moral whipping stick in the other. ''Too many times I've had to use big words to awaken the world this year,'' he said recently in a telephone interview from Copenhagen. ''But it has simply been a year of megadisasters, and each one being huge in its challenges and unique in the number of people whose lives have been at stake.'' It is why he has been pleading for the creation of a United Nations emergency relief fund, through which emergencies of various sorts can be met swiftly. The United Nations envisions a fund of roughly $500 million, though aid agencies like Oxfam say it should be double that amount. The United States has not pledged a contribution to such a fund; Britain has. ''There should be predictability in the right to getting life-saving relief,'' Mr. Egeland said. ''It should not be a lottery.'' Some aid groups diverted post-tsunami money to other, equally pressing crises; the United Nations is not allowed to use money that is earmarked for one purpose for another. What difference can money make on the ground? Action Against Hunger, an international relief group, raised $27,000 two weeks after the earthquake, compared with $400,000 in the same period after the tsunami. The group could have gotten tents immediately, but instead it had to wait nearly three weeks, until money came through. Catholic Relief Services, which raised less than $3 million for the earthquake, compared with $64 million for the tsunami, would have reached many more villages. There are less charitable theories as to why South Asian earthquake survivors have not fared well on what Mr. Egeland calls the relief lottery. Dr. Hina Chaudhry, a cardiologist at Columbia University and a Pakistani by descent, said that the tsunami struck beach areas that were familiar to ''supermodels on vacation.'' Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, where 30,000 people died, was not such a destination. ''It's absolutely shocking to me how the world has basically ignored it,'' she said. Stacy Palmer, editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy, said that holiday-season magnanimity helped tsunami fund-raising. Because the disaster struck the day after Christmas, Americans, Europeans and others were glued to the television, with family at their side. ''It was hard not to pay attention to it,'' she said. ''A lot of it has to do with timing.'' AFTERMATHS"
"A powerful earthquake hit southern Iran on Sunday, causing major destruction in seven villages and killing 10 people and injuring 80. The tremor shook Oman and the United Arab Emirates as well, forcing many office workers to evacuate their buildings. The official IRNA news agency and the United States Geological Survey said it had a magnitude of 5.9. Iran's seismologic center said the epicenter of the earthquake was in the waters of the Persian Gulf, 35 miles southwest of the port of Bandar Abbas. Iran is on seismic fault lines. A major earthquake killed more than 31,000 in city of Bam in central Iran in 2003, and 600 were killed in the city of Zarand in February in an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.4. The tourist Island of Qeshm on the Persian Gulf and seven of its villages were most strongly affected by the quake. It hit at 1:53 p.m. local time and was followed by at least four strong aftershocks, IRNA reported. The news agency also reported that one of the major hospitals on the island, in the village of Jeyhian, was destroyed and the village's power lines were cut. The island's airport was also damaged. Abdolreza Sheikholeslami, the governor of Hormozgan Province, the center of the damaged area, said 40 percent to 70 percent of the buildings in seven villages were destroyed, IRNA reported. Two helicopters began moving the injured to the hospital in Bandar Abbas, and aid workers began distributing food, blankets and tents in the region, the governor said. Qeshm is Iran's largest island in the Persian Gulf, with a population of 120,000. The quake jolted several cities in the United Arab Emirates, across the Persian Gulf from Iran. Office workers in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, evacuated several buildings in the city, pouring onto the streets and snarling traffic. There were no reported injuries in Dubai. Mehdi Zareh, director of the seismological center in Tehran, dismissed concerns that the earthquake would cause tsunamis, IRNA reported. ''The Persian Gulf is not deep enough so that we can expect tsunamis,'' he was quoted as saying."
"Chinese officials announced on Sunday that water had been restored in the northeastern provincial capital of Harbin after a tide of toxic river water had forced the closing of the municipal water system for five days. But the central government, which is under criticism for its handling of the Harbin crisis, was faced with apparent devastation in southeastern China after an earthquake reportedly left several hundred thousand people without shelter. Details about the earthquake and the extent of damage were difficult to discern. But the official New China News Agency reported on Monday morning that 600,000 residents had been ''relocated'' in Jiangxi Province after an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.7 rattled the region at 8:49 a.m. Saturday. State news media reported that at least 16 people were killed, roughly 8,000 were injured, and an estimated 150,000 homes destroyed. Damage was also reported in adjacent Hubei Province. But the most affected region appears to be in Jiangxi Province, between the summer resort of Jiujiang and the city of Ruichang. State media reported that more than 400,000 people in Ruichang had ''left their homes.'' ''Almost everyone in Ruichang is out on the streets,'' a civil affairs official told the New China News Agency. Different Chinese media reports suggested that many of these people were refusing to return inside because of rumors that another major quake was coming. Other Chinese news organizations reported that stampedes of frightened residents had caused injuries. The Ministry of Civil Affairs said it had rushed food, water and more than 6,000 tents to the region. In Harbin, city officials restarted the water system by 6 p.m. Sunday. The city's four million residents were advised to delay drinking the water until it could be flushed from the pipes after five days of disuse. Residents were advised to limit their water use for cleaning until the government posted a new advisory. Even so, Zhang Zuoji, the provincial governor of Heilongjiang Province, which includes Harbin, was photographed drinking a glass of boiled tap water in an effort to restore the shaken public faith. ''It tastes good,'' Mr. Zhang said. Tests of the Songhua River, the tributary that is the city's primary water source, showed that a 50-mile slick of benzene-polluted water had passed the intake valves of the water system. A Nov. 13 explosion at a factory upstream caused more than 100 tons of benzene and nitrobenzene to spill into the Songhua. Benzene has been linked in studies to cancer. But the responses by the government and the factory have drawn nationwide criticism as officials initially sought to conceal the pollution spill. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has promised to investigate but has made no admission of a cover-up. China, meanwhile, was forced to make an embarrassing apology to Russia for failing to give an immediate warning about the spill. The pollution is moving toward the city of Khabarovsk, in Russia's Far East. And in yet another accident, if one that has become commonplace in China, at least 30 miners were reported killed after a mining accident in Heilongjiang. Another 100 miners are still missing."
"Two children with cholera were brought to a Japanese Red Cross medical tent in this mountain town on Thursday, doctors said, raising fears that the grim conditions among the homeless and wounded survivors of the earthquake on Oct. 8 were deteriorating further as winter set in. Work here in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir has just begun to dig out the bodies of about 100 children crushed when their primary school collapsed. In a sign of the continuing threats to public health in the earthquake zone, six bodies that were retrieved Wednesday night had been left just yards from the medical center. To compound the problems that continue 26 days after the quake, what was suspected of being a missile attack on an American helicopter near here on Tuesday raised concerns that Kashmiri militants were turning their sights to the American military, which has been second only to the Pakistani military in its contributions to the relief effort. The helicopter was not hit, but the episode caused enough concern to bring the commander of American forces in Afghanistan, Lt. Gen. Karl W. Eikenberry, to Pakistan on Thursday to meet with the Pakistani high command. Pakistani officials contended that the American helicopter crew had not seen an attack but an explosion caused by engineers trying to clear landslides on the road near Chinari. But American officials said the Chinook crew members were experienced after months of combat in Afghanistan and had spotted an explosion on the hills well above the road. In an effort to mitigate hostility in the region, American military officials met with a council of elders from Chinari on Wednesday and on Thursday sent helicopters with relief supplies to respond to the elders' requests. People's views are mixed,'' said Zahir, a student from Karachi who uses only one name and was working with his father's military engineering unit to dig out the bodies of the children at the primary school. ''Some are grateful to the foreigners and the Americans for all the aid. But some are angry and criticize them and the government for not helping enough.'' The scene across the steep terraced mountains of the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir remains one of devastation and dislocation. Blue canvas tents dot the hillsides, where families camp beside their damaged homes. Lines of people hike along roads and narrow paths over the landslides, and long lines of people await relief supplies in the towns. Not far from Chinari, a mountainside has collapsed into the river valley below, sweeping away houses and terraced fields, and creating a mountain of rock and mud hundreds of feet high that has changed the course of the river. In the American military mobile hospital set up in the regional capital, Muzaffarabad, Nasir Ahmad, 55, a secondary school teacher from the Neelam Valley nursing a broken ankle, made an urgent plea. ''Just clear the roads of landslides,'' he said. ''There are a lot of people suffering still in Neelam. People will definitely start dying.'' The members of his family were among the thousands left homeless by the earthquake. When he left to seek medical treatment, his wife and five children had food for only 20 days, which would be running out, he said. ''They just have some corn, that's all,'' he said. ''I am worried about my family.'' The most difficult job facing the military relief effort here is how to clear the roads enough to bring in the thousands of tons of food and other supplies needed by people like Mr. Ahmad before winter weather sets in. Up to three million people are estimated to be homeless because of the quake. General Eikenberry, who has command of the 900-member disaster assistance force in Pakistan and the 20,000 coalition troops in Afghanistan, made a one-day visit from his Afghan headquarters in Kabul to inspect the American operation and meet with Pakistan military commanders. The American military operation is becoming increasingly important here because the United Nations has warned that a shortage of money will hamper its operations. ''The Pakistani government and military are trying still to make a determination of the requirements they will need during winter,'' General Eikenberry said in an interview. About 4,000 people in 20 villages in valleys blocked by landslides have not received any aid, nor have Pakistani military survey teams reached them, Lt. Col. Tariq Jawed, the helicopter operations officer at Chaklala Air Base, told the general. ''Along 50 kilometers there are multiple landslides on one road,'' said Lt. Col. Jeff Kilian, of the 74th Naval Marine Construction Battalion, which has started clearing operations in Muzaffarabad. The landslides were so big they had to be blasted with explosives, he said. The only choice for much of the region remains bringing in supplies by air, he said. General Eikenberry said he was concentrating on increasing the efficiency of the 24 American helicopters by setting up refueling bases closer to the affected zone to reduce flying time. Airdrops over the inaccessible villages have begun, as have mule trains used to carry supplies to areas cut off by landslides."
"Dr. Keiiti Aki, a seismologist whose penetrating studies of the behavior and origins of earthquakes contributed to a deeper understanding of natural disasters, died May 17 on Réunion island in the Indian Ocean. He was 75. The cause was a brain hemorrhage suffered after a fall, said a close friend, John K. McRaney of the Southern California Earthquake Center, where Dr. Aki had been a director. In a career that spanned the earth sciences, Dr. Aki, a resident of Réunion, east of Madagascar, was interested in applying methods of quantitative analysis to shape theories in seismology. He was widely known for his concept of the ''seismic moment,'' which he developed in the 1960's as a means of measuring the magnitude of earthquakes. While studying a huge earthquake that struck Niigata, Japan, in 1964, Dr. Aki devised a calculation that considers the area affected by an earthquake, the rigidity of the underlying rock and the distance the rocks slip. The result -- the seismic moment -- is a measure of the energy released by an earthquake, and is used in addition to the moment magnitude scale, now the standard measurement announced to the public after disasters like the earthquake-generated tsunamis in December. Dr. Aki explained the concept in a paper he published in 1966. Dr. Paul G. Richards, a professor of natural sciences at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, said Dr. Aki had ''brought quantitative methods to bear on anything to do with the way the ground moves.'' Dr. Richards added, ''His work touched just about every side of seismology, in terms of understanding the physics of earthquakes.'' In the 1970's, Dr. Aki and other scientists began to make use of a network of fixed and portable measuring devices, called seismometers, on various continents to studying the deep structure of the earth through the waves issued by distant earthquakes. The field was later refined and became known as seismic tomography. In 1980, Dr. Aki and Dr. Richards published a two-volume textbook, ''Quantitative Seismology: Theory and Methods.'' The book ''codified a lot of theoretical developments and became the most often cited reference in seismology,'' said Dr. Thomas H. Jordan, director of the Southern California Earthquake Center, which is affiliated with the University of Southern California. Dr. Aki joined the faculty there in 1984 and retired in 2004. He was also the earthquake center's first director and in the 1990's brought his expertise to bear on forecasting earthquakes in California. He examined Southern California's fault lines and prepared what Dr. Jordan called a ''master model,'' using the state as a laboratory to study a larger physical system. Keiiti Aki was born in Yokohama, Japan. He earned undergraduate and doctoral degrees from the University of Tokyo before beginning his postdoctoral research at the California Institute of Technology in 1958. After teaching at the Earthquake Research Institute in Tokyo, he was a professor of geophysics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and from 1966 to 1984. He became an American citizen in 1976. At his death, Dr. Aki was studying the seismology of volcanoes on Réunion. Dr. Aki was elected president of the Seismological Society of America in 1980. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In March, he received the Gutenberg Medal of the European Geosciences Union. Last year, the American Geophysical Union gave him the Bowie Medal, its highest honor. Dr. Aki is survived by his wife, Valérie Ferrazzini, a geophysicist, and their two daughters, Kajika and Uka, all of Réunion; and by two sons from a previous marriage, Shota, of Weare, N.H., and Zenta, of Redondo Beach, Calif."
"The shock waves from December's giant earthquake set off devastating tsunamis. They also set off a series of temblors nearly 7,000 miles from the epicenter in the Indian Ocean. One hour after the earthquake struck off the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Dec. 26, seismometers that keep watch over Mount Wrangell in Alaska recorded an unusual pattern: 14 earthquakes over 11 minutes. The small quakes, up to magnitude 2.0, coincided with a train of shock waves from Sumatra. When the ground pulled apart slightly, Mount Wrangell shuddered. ''Pulsing, if you will, in sync with the waves from Sumatra,'' said Dr. Michael E. West, a seismologist at the Alaska Volcano Observatory. Mount Wrangell is a huge 14,000-foot-high volcano -- ''It has little pimples on the side of it that are the size of Mount St. Helens,'' Dr. West said -- in southern Alaska, and while it has not erupted in historic times, it regularly spews out steam, and small earthquakes are common. The findings by Dr. West and his colleagues appear in the current issue of the journal Science, part of a package of scientific papers describing the earthquake, which ruptured more than 800 miles of the sea floor in the eastern Indian Ocean. The earthquake started about 180 miles south of Banda Aceh, the hard-hit city on Sumatra, and the fault broke to the north-northwest. At first, the fault broke relatively slowly for an earthquake: 2,000 miles per hour. At a bend in the fault to the west of Banda Aceh, the breakage sped up to 5,000 to 6,000 m.p.h. and continued to the Nicobar Islands. The shaking lasted 10 minutes. North of the Nicobar Islands, hundreds of miles of the fault also slipped, but the slippage occurred so slowly, an hour or longer, that it did not generate seismic waves as it tilted and lifted the Andaman Islands. ''That is something we have not observed before,'' said Dr. Thorne Lay, a professor of earth sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the lead author of one of the articles in Science. ''It tells us there is frictional behavior on these faults that we don't understand.'' That slow slippage also contributed to the tsunamis, Dr. Lay said, although less than if the fault had broken quickly. That is also partly why the earthquake, initially measured at magnitude 9.0, is now regarded as having been between magnitude 9.1 and 9.3. The largest earthquake ever recorded was a magnitude 9.5 earthquake in Chile in 1960. A magnitude 9.2 earthquake occurred in Alaska in 1964. But the Sumatra earthquake ''is the longest rupture we've ever seen,'' said Dr. Roger Bilham, a professor of geological sciences at the University of Colorado who wrote an article in Science summarizing the other papers. Dr. Bilham calculated that the movement, pushing the Indo-Australian tectonic plate up to 50 feet beneath the Eurasian plate, reduced the size of the Indian Ocean enough to raise sea level by 0.5 millimeters globally, and the quake released the energy equal to a billion tons of TNT. The shock waves, with wavelengths of hundreds of miles, traveled around the world, lifting and dropping the earth's rocky crust by at least half an inch. Vibrations of the entire earth, ringing like a bell, continued for days and weeks afterward. Twenty years ago, seismologists doubted that an earthquake, even a large one, could unhinge a distant fault. Then, in 1992, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.3 in Landers, Calif., was followed by a series of small earthquakes in Mammoth Lakes, Calif., nearly 300 miles away, and at Yellowstone National Park, 800 miles away. An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.9 in Denali, Alaska, showed that the triggering could extend farther, setting off quakes in Yellowstone, 2,000 miles distant. Now, with Sumatra, ''This tells us that earthquake triggering can happen on a global scale,'' Dr. West said. ''We're learning the earth is a far more connected place than we once thought it was.'' The triggered earthquakes observed to date have all been small and in volcanically active areas that appear to be more sensitive to rumblings in the ground. Seismologists still doubt that one earthquake can set off a major earthquake on a different fault. ''There's no reason to think that they could,'' Dr. West said. ''I think there's no precedent for it.''"
"Bruce A. Bolt, a seismologist who made important observations about earthquakes in California and later helped translate the research into safer and more resilient bridges and buildings, died on July 21 in Oakland, Calif. He was 75. The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said. From 1963 to 1991, Dr. Bolt directed the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory, which maintains a network of about 25 broadband seismometers in California and Oregon to measure the earth's movements along the San Andreas fault and other seismic features. Dr. Bolt examined variations in waves recorded by the seismometers and was an early proponent of making digital recordings on tape, instead of paper, to allow for computer analysis. He studied the deep-earth sources of earthquakes and coined the more graphic term ''fling'' for a phenomenon scientists call elastic rebound, which occurs along a fault line in an earthquake's initial stages. It is this snap-back along a slipping fault, much like the rebound of a rubber band, that causes much of the damage to structures after a quake. In 1975, Dr. Bolt and Toshi Asada, a Japanese seismologist, led a study of the Gorda Basin, off California's northern coastline. Using a string of underwater seismometers, the team recorded frequent small earthquakes, as many as five per hour, and a surprising level of seismic activity near the San Andreas fault. In the 1980's and 90's, Dr. Bolt encouraged a more rational public response in preparing for the likelihood of major earthquakes. He served as chairman of the California Seismic Safety Commission and made the point that ''by using physics and mathematics, you can study the forces that govern earthquakes to improve earthquake-resistant designs for public structures,'' said Douglas S. Dreger, an associate professor of geophysics at the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Bolt advised on the strengthening of the Golden Gate Bridge and studied the destructive San Francisco earthquake of 1906 in making recommendations to engineers for improving the resilience of the city's buildings. He also conducted ground-motion studies for the designs of dams, oil pipelines, nuclear reactors and underground train systems. He wrote two popular books, ''Inside the Earth: Evidence from Earthquakes,'' in 1982, and ''Earthquakes: A Primer,'' first published in 1978; its fifth edition appeared in 2003. Both were published by W.H. Freeman. Bruce Alan Bolt was born in Australia in Largs, New South Wales. He earned his doctorate in applied mathematics from the University of Sydney in 1955. Dr. Bolt was named a professor of seismology at Berkeley in 1963 and remained there until retiring in 1993. He served as president of the Seismological Society of America from 1974 to 1975. He was a former president of the California Academy of Sciences. In 1987, Dr. Bolt was elected an associate of the Royal Astronomical Society. He became an American citizen in 1972. Dr. Bolt is survived by his wife of 49 years, the former Beverley Bentley, a mathematician who contributed to his earthquake studies. The couple lived in Berkeley. He is also survived by a son, Robert of Hillsborough, Calif.; three daughters, Margaret Barber of Rumson, N.J.; Helen Bolt Juarez of Fremont, Calif.; and Gillian Bolt Kohli of Wellesley, Mass.; a sister, Fay Bolt of Sydney, Australia; and 14 grandchildren."
"A minor earthquake rumbled southern California on Thursday, shaking the ground from its epicenter near the town of Yucaipa, about 70 miles east of Los Angeles, as far as the coastal town of Laguna Beach. The earthquake, which had a magnitude of 4.9, was the third to shake the state since early Sunday morning, when a quake centered about 20 miles south of Palm Springs hit. The second quake, which hit Tuesday, began several miles below the ocean floor off the coast of northern California near the Oregon border; that undersea quake caused fears of a tsunami along the coast. But seismologists said that the quakes did not necessarily portend a worse quake in the coming days. ''These events are probably unrelated, that would be the wisdom on this one,'' said Tom Jordan, director of the Southern California Earthquake Center, in a telephone interview. ''Typically earthquakes don't interact on that scale.'' There is a very slightly elevated chance of another earthquake in the next week, Dr, Jordan said, ''but the increase in probability is actually quite small.'' In Yucaipa, in the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains, the quake shook tiles from ceilings in a supermarket, knocked books off shelves and rattled nerves all over town, though no injuries were reported. At Rosie's, a Mexican restaurant on Yucaipa Boulevard, a 15-year-old boy who identified himself only as Alex said he had been playing video games at a friend's house when the quake hit. ''I saw the window shaking and the picture frames started falling off the walls,'' Alex said. ''My friend's brother -- he's 11 -- started panicking. He didn't know what to do, so my friend told all of us to get under a doorframe. So we did, the three of us.'' A firefighter who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak on the record said he and his colleagues had inspected about 40 buildings in town after the quake and found damage in only a few, like the cracks in the walls of the Baptist and Seventh-day Adventist churches. At the Stater Brothers supermarket, employees swept up debris from fallen ceiling tiles. ''The bigger the building, the less give they had when the earthquake rode through,'' said the firefighter, a 30-year veteran of the California Department of Forestry, which helps provide fire protection to the city. But, he added, the quake did not cause a major ruckus. ''Earthquakes are no big surprise for us in this place,'' he said. Another firefighter, Patti West, an engineer and paramedic at Fire Station No. 1, said she and her colleagues moved four fire trucks out of the station immediately after the quake in case it got stronger and knocked the building down. They then answered a call from a woman who thought she smelled leaking gas in her home. None was found. Tami Johnston, 46, a homemaker in Yucaipa, described the quake as ''a big jolt at first.'' She added, ''When we thought it had stopped, it started shaking again. We felt several of the aftershocks.'' Ms. Johnston, who lives about half a mile from the epicenter, said she has a baby Chihuahua who is a pretty good indicator of aftershocks. ''She starts to whine, and then we look on the Internet, and we've had another one,'' Ms. Johnston said. As of Thursday afternoon, about 25 aftershocks had hit southern California, said seismologists at the California Institute of Technology. Kate Hutton of CalTech said the clustering of earthquakes in the same week is not necessarily significant. ''If you look at history, there are a lot of occasions where quakes have clumped in time even though they have been at slightly different locations,'' Dr. Hutton said. ''It doesn't alarm us to see that happen, but on the other hand we don't have an explanation for it.''"
"Like those who visit the doctor when a familiar ailment acts up, Californians pained by earthquakes turned to seismologists on Friday for answers and a little comfort. Even in a state accustomed to chronic rattling, there has been an unbearable outbreak the past few days, with four sizeable temblors since Sunday. ''Oh, my goodness, it's been that kind of week,'' said Susan Garcia, who was scheduling interviews with seismologists for television crews at the offices of the United States Geological Survey here. The scientists, meanwhile, monitored thousands of ''Did You Feel It?'' reports posted on the agency's Web site by anxious residents. Although Californians might know little about the tectonics behind the shaking, they took to documenting it with determination. But just as medicine can produce differing opinions, seismology is not always as precise as some might hope. There is no dependable warning system, and even after a quake, scientists can disagree on what actually occurred. Steve Walter, a seismologist, and Rufus Catchings, a research geophysicist, looked at data on one of this week's earthquakes, a 4.9-magnitude temblor on Thursday in Yucaipa, and reached opposite conclusions about what it might mean for the San Andreas fault, the most notorious and dreaded in the state. Mr. Walter said it was a good sign that the Yucaipa quake appeared to have struck closer to another fault, the Banning, because it indicated that the San Andreas, which has been more or less locked in place since the middle of the 19th century, remained inactive. ''That's good,'' Mr. Walter said. ''It's not going to unlock gently.'' But Dr. Catchings shook his head with concern as he examined a map of fault lines, suggesting that it would have been better if the Yucaipa quake had struck closer to the San Andreas and allowed it to release some stress. ''That means stress is still building, building, building and building,'' Dr. Catchings said. ''And it's overdue for a really big one.'' Not so long ago, scientists had to wait days to receive even the most basic data after a quake, let alone to begin disagreeing on how to interpret it. Now word gets out fast, even to the general public, calming some nerves (the knowledge-is-power group) and feeding some fears (the ignorance-is-bliss group). The four quakes since Sunday, two off the northern coast and two in the southern desert, caused minor damage and no deaths. Scientists generally concurred that there was no relationship between those in the north and those in the south, which was one of the biggest worries. But with so much shaking in so little time over such a large part of the state, some residents were still feeling a little wobbly on Friday. ''Wait! I thought I just felt something,'' Ashley Wetmore, a hostess at the Beach Chalet Brewery and Restaurant in San Francisco, said during a telephone interview. Ms. Wetmore hollered to a colleague (''Was that another one?'' ''No!'') and then returned to the phone. ''It was nothing,'' she said. ''Sorry about that. It's just crazy that all of these earthquakes are happening. I'm not used to it.'' Ms. Wetmore lived through the last big quake in the San Francisco area, in 1989, and said she had barely thought about earthquakes since. That all changed on Tuesday night, when a 7.2 quake struck about 90 miles off the coast of Crescent City, near the Oregon border, prompting a tsunami warning along the entire West Coast. A 6.7 quake on Thursday night in the same area has been categorized as an aftershock. Ms. Wetmore said she was instructed to evacuate the restaurant on Tuesday night because a tsunami was ''going to hit in 23 minutes.'' ''That was a little nerve racking,'' she recalled. ''People were pretty panicked.'' The tsunami warning was called off, but the anxiety persisted. In Crescent City, the owner of an oceanfront Hampton Inn and Suites said the public's worries were easy to explain. ''Everybody is afraid of dying,'' said the owner, Xiao Jin Yuan, who on Tuesday night frantically banged on doors in the three-story hotel to alert guests to the danger. ''You just try your best to prepare yourself,'' he said. Sometimes familiarity makes the coping easier. To Melanie Ilies, who survived a devastating earthquake on March 4, 1977, that killed about 1,500 people and injured 11,000 in her native Romania, a little ground-shaking in California is a mere trifle. Ms. Ilies, who was strolling with her son, Mihai, 64, in an outdoor mall in Los Angeles on Friday, said no one she knew here even talked about small quakes. ''I am not scared,'' said Ms. Ilies, who moved to the area in 1987. ''If you survive a big earthquake, this is nothing.'' Having lived in Los Angeles for more than four decades, Joe Malkin said he considered earthquakes as much a part of life as breathing. He felt the Yucaipa temblor on Thursday afternoon, but only for a couple of seconds. ''I couldn't understand what all the hullabaloo was about,'' said Mr. Malkin, 83, a retired computer programmer. For some recent visitors, such a calm attitude was unfathomable. Steve and Laura Dayan were visiting Santa Barbara this week from Chappaqua, N.Y., with their sons, Ari, 7, and Ian, 4. The family was watching a baseball game on television in a waterfront hotel when the tsunami warning flashed on the screen Tuesday night. ''My mom was going berserk,'' Ari said. ''She kept saying, 'We've got to get out of here!'''"
"Vice President Dick Cheney on Tuesday swooped into one of the regions hit hardest by the devastating earthquake in October, seeking to highlight the relief efforts undertaken by the United States and improve its image in the Muslim world. On a one-day trip to Pakistan, Mr. Cheney met with President Pervez Musharraf in the capital, Islamabad, and then got into a helicopter to come here, 65 miles to the north, to tour a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital that the United States sent to the area soon after the earthquake on Oct. 8. About 73,000 people are believed to have died in the earthquake, which had its epicenter six miles from this town on the edge of the Himalayas. Accompanied by his wife, Lynne, and the Pakistani foreign minister, Mian Kasuri, Mr. Cheney viewed earthquake damage from his helicopter on the way in, then toured the MASH unit and got a briefing on the relief efforts. ''It's been an amazing experience to see the extent of the devastation,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''I'm also obviously tremendously impressed with what we've been able to do with our MASH units,'' he said. ''We were here within 48 hours and we've been here ever since.'' American officials said the hospital had treated more than 7,500 patients in the past two months. But they said most of the patients arriving now are not victims of the earthquake, but local residents who had little access to health care even before Oct. 8 and have come to rely on the American facility. Mr. Cheney also used his meeting with Mr. Musharraf to highlight the American relief efforts after the earthquake. Mr. Musharraf, speaking at the beginning of their meeting at the presidential palace in Islamabad, expressed his nation's gratitude for the help provided by the United States, including money and helicopters. A senior administration official, who sought anonymity to speak candidly about policy issues, said Pakistan has been cooperating well with the United States in combating terrorism. Pakistan, the official said, was now working with the government of Afghanistan on terrorism-related issues; the official declined to elaborate, citing the classified nature of the programs the two countries are involved in. Mr. Cheney was scheduled to go on to Saudi Arabia and Egypt on Thursday. But he was summoned home late Tuesday to be on hand to break any tie votes in the Senate as Congress rushes to deal with legislation that the administration wants signed by the end of the year."
"Putting a Lid on It As society pumps more and more of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, scientists are trying to determine what can be done to reduce the effect on global temperatures. One area of research is in developing ways to store much of the gas, perhaps underground or in the sea. But nature already has several storage systems for carbon dioxide, including plants and trees, which use the gas in photosynthesis. Scientists have wondered if trees will soak up some of the additional carbon dioxide, by growing faster. The effects of CO2 enrichment have been tested on shrubs, grasses and small trees, but it is more difficult to conduct such experiments on large trees in a natural forest. An international team led by researchers at the University of Basel in Switzerland has done just that, however, with a novel approach that involved setting up a 140-foot-tall construction crane in the middle of a hardwood forest of oaks, lindens, maples and other species. They used the crane to run a network of porous plastic tubes through the forest canopy and pumped carbon dioxide through it over four years. Over that time they measured various aspects of tree growth to see the effect the elevated CO2. Their conclusion: although the response differed among the tree species, over all there was no increase in leaf or stem growth over the four years. The trees grew vigorously, the researchers reported in the journal Science, but they did not add biomass. So perhaps trees will not be of much help in storing excess carbon dioxide. Farmers' Almanac An El Niño event can bring heavy rains to certain areas and drought to others. Either way, the weather can wreak havoc on agriculture. Forecasters have gotten better about predicting such seasonal events, however, so farmers can plan accordingly. If drought is expected, for example, they can plant drought-resistant seeds, or alter planting times to make better use of what little rainfall there is. That all works well if the farmers hear of the forecast. In much of the developing world, however, there is no reliable way for subsistence farmers to hear of potential droughts before they happen. In Zimbabwe and a few other countries, efforts have been made to get such forecasts to farmers, usually by radio. The question then is, Do they do any good? Do farmers change their planting plans in response? Anthony Patt and Pablo Suarez of Boston University and Chiedza Gwata of the University of Zimbabwe investigated these questions in four Zimbabwean villages where local farmers plant maize, sorghum and millet. In each village, a groups of 50 farmers attended a brief workshop where the forecasts were explained and alternative planting strategies discussed. The study, published in The Proceedings in the National Academy of Sciences, showed that farmers who attended the workshop made better use of the forecasts than those who heard of them through other means. And farmers who changed their planting schemes had better harvests. So timely access to forecasts is useful, the researchers say, though other assistance -- in the form of cheaper fertilizer, say, or better availability of credit for making improvements like irrigation -- may be even more important. The Ripple Effect There's more evidence of the power of the Dec. 26 earthquake that spawned the tsunami that killed hundreds of thousands of people around the Indian Ocean. The wave continued around the world, though at much lower energy, guided by an undersea ridge. Researchers from the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory and other institutions reported in the online edition of Science that small waves were recorded at places like Halifax, Nova Scotia (halfway around the world from the quake's epicenter) up to a day after the event. Wave heights were much smaller than the tsunami, ranging from a few inches in England to 10 inches in Alaska to about 20 inches in Halifax and Peru. Bacteria Get Their Day: Undercount Is Rectified How many different species of bacteria would you find in a thimbleful of soil? Until recently, scientists would have said about 10,000. While that is a remarkable number, scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory have now revised it upward by at least two orders of magnitude. In a study published in the journal Science, they report that a gram of unpolluted soil contains a million bacterial species or more. It is impossible to count, or even identify, that number of species. The researchers -- John Dunbar, Jason Gans and Murray Wolinsky of the laboratory's bioscience division -- analyzed data on DNA reassociation kinetics, or how long it takes for broken-up bits of DNA from all the bacteria, roughly a billion cells in a gram of soil, to reassemble. The amount of time indicates how many species are present. ''Think about going to a party with a partner,'' Dr. Dunbar said. ''The more people there are at the party, the harder it's going to be to find your partner just by bumping into each other.'' It's the same with fragments of DNA, he said. ''The more sequences you have in the sample, the more diverse it is, the longer it takes for the pieces to come back together.'' The researchers actually reanalyzed old data, using more sophisticated mathematics that took into account that there might be a lot of some species and very little of others. ''In previous analyses, researchers did not account for differences in species abundance,'' Dr. Dunbar said. ''As a result, they dramatically undercounted.'' ''In one sense, what we did was very trivial,'' he added. ''We simply allowed for the fact that species are almost certainly present at different abundances. The sophisticated thing we did was reorganizing the math to allow us to analyze this.'' Their results showed that of the million or more species, 99.9 percent were present in small quantities. A relative handful of species dominate. The researchers also analyzed data from polluted soil, showing that heavy metal contamination sharply reduces microbial diversity. So the method should prove useful in studying damage from pollution or other environmental conditions. ''We've taken a very old experimental technique and developed new mathematical methods that can accurately assess species loss due to pollution and climate change,'' Dr. Dunbar said. Observatory"
"You don't need a seismograph to know when the earth quakes. That's not exactly the way the song goes, but it's not a bad way to summarize the conclusion of an article this spring in Seismological Research Letters. The article, by scientists, American Indians and others, found references in art and stories of natives of the Pacific Northwest to the Cascadia earthquake of 1700. The quake, judged to be magnitude 9.0, had already been dated. Japanese records of a tsunami allowed geologists to pin it down to 9 p.m. on Jan. 26, 1700. Tree ring patterns in cedar roots were also used. But the Japanese were not the only people affected by the quake. Natives of the Pacific Northwest would have experienced a great quake and tsunami because the earthquake occurred in a fault only about 80 miles offshore. Their stories of flooding and earth shaking date the quake to the same time, according to the article. The events are also memorialized in mythical stories about Thunderbird and Whale, shown in a ceremonial screen, below. Thunderbird is sometimes drawn down into the sea by Whale, causing great disruption, and sometimes drops Whale on the land, causing it to quake. The authors note that stories and fables of floods and earth shaking occur elsewhere, like Sumatra and Sri Lanka, which have experienced disastrous Indian Ocean tsunamis. JAMES GORMAN FINDINGS"
"In the history of humankind, there has rarely been a disaster like the New Orleans flood without a theodicy to go along with it. The word ''theodicy,'' coined in the 18th century by the philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, derives from Greek roots invoking the ''justice of the gods.'' A theodicy is an attempt to show that such justice exists, to prove that we really do live in what Leibniz insisted was the ''best of all possible worlds.'' So theodicies have been plentiful after earthquakes, floods and droughts. Explanations are readily offered: disasters are the wages of sin, they herald an apocalyptic age, they cleanse the earth of evil. Theodicies aim to demonstrate that devastation does not really disrupt or overturn our understanding of the moral and social order. Instead, disorder provides evidence of order. The theodicy is that order. It explains forces that seem to lie beyond human powers, evils that lie beyond human cause. Theodicies are not casual matters, and in the weeks after Katrina, they are bound to evolve, even in secular culture, even when they may not resemble the ones that Leibniz had in mind. So they need to be better understood. The classic theodicies in the West are biblical. The flood of Noah's time, for example, is a reflection of the divine will, cleansing the earth of humanity's evil. A more powerful theodicy later evolved out of the trials of the ancient Israelites, in which destruction and exile were treated not as random accidents of history, but as forms of retribution for violating the Mosaic law and its ethical consequences. Suffering could become proof of divine attention and not its opposite. Scholars like Norman Cohn have shown how in medieval Europe the worst human trauma could be interpreted as proof of imminent apocalypse and redemption, inspiring millennial expectations and movements. Meanwhile, the theodicy of divine retribution still thrives today and was invoked by some fundamentalist believers after Katrina. But between medieval Europe and contemporary America something profound changed in the way natural disasters are interpreted and the kinds of theodicies they inspire. And one of the turning points, as many scholars have argued, was the 1755 earthquake in Lisbon. It destroyed perhaps a third of the city's population, with deaths in the tens of thousands. It overturned the confidence of European royalty and seemed to drive a wedge between the earthly and divine realms. For the growing forces of the Enlightenment, it also seemed to overturn the very idea that a theodicy could account for the disaster. Voltaire, who had once seen nature as benevolent, was whipped into a rationalist fury by the experience. Leibniz, he believed, had been refuted by nature. Voltaire wrote a ''Poem on the Disaster of Lisbon'' in which the quake's victims are called ''Tormented atoms on a heap of muck/ That death devours and that fate trips up.'' His character Candide watches the earthquake from a distance, seeing it as morally blind, killing the good and preserving the wicked. In a sense, the earthquake actually ended up strengthening the hand of the Enlightenment, as if a replacement theodicy had fallen into place. Kant wrote about the quake. Scientific investigation took place. The response of Portugal's prime minister to the disaster was practical, not religious. ''We will bury the dead,'' he said, ''and take care of the living.'' Recently, the philosopher Susan Neiman argued in ''Evil in Modern Thought'' that the Lisbon earthquake also destroyed an ancient idea that nature could itself be evil. After Lisbon, she argued, moral evil was distinguished from natural disaster. Earthquakes and floods could no longer be fitted into traditional religious theodicies. But this did not mean, of course, that theodicies faded away. Ms. Neiman argued that for philosophers theology had been replaced by history. The fates of peoples and nations reflected other forces, and disruptions were given other forms of explanation. Hegel saw history as an evolutionary series of transformations in which destruction was as inevitable as birth. Marx believed other kinds of economic and human laws accounted for destruction and evolution. This mostly left natural disasters for the growing realm of science: if they couldn't be prevented, at least their origins could be understood. Now though, with the prospect of thousands of dead becoming plausible with reports from New Orleans, other forms of theodicy also taking shape. Much debate is taking place about the scale of human tragedy, about procedures and planning and responsibility. And none of that should be ignored. But it is remarkable how this natural disaster has almost imperceptibly come to seem the result of human agency, as if failures in planning were almost evidence of cause, as if forces of nature were subject to human oversight. The hurricane has been humanized. I don't want to push this too far, of course; human actions, as the Portuguese prime minister knew, are crucial. But this is still an important change in our views of the natural world. In a way, it inflates human knowledge. It confidently extends scientific and political power into the realm of nature. It doesn't really explain catastrophe, but it attempts to explain why we are forced to experience it: because of human failings. There is a theodicy at work here, in the ways in which the reaction to natural catastrophe so readily becomes political. Nature becomes something to be managed or mismanaged; it lies within the political order, not outside it. Theodicy, if successful, does not overturn belief but confirms it. So, for some commentators, the flood and its aftermath provided confirmation of their previous doubts about the Bush adminstration. Actually, in some respects, this theodicy has gone even beyond the political: just as a religious theodicy might have shown natural catastrophe to be the result of human misdeed, many of the early commentators about the flood did the same, creating a kind of scientific/moral theodicy in which human sin is still a dominant factor. Last week, for example, Germany's minister of the environment, Jürgen Trittin, said: ''The American president has closed his eyes to the economic and human damage that natural catastrophes such as Katrina -- in other words, disasters caused by a lack of climate protection measures -- can visit on his country.'' All of these explanations are subject to examination and debate of course, but in the heart of a secular age, they are also something else. They are theodicies. And in the face of nature's awesome and horrific powers, the prospect of political retribution is as prevalent as the promise of divine retribution once was. CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK"
"All Shook Up An earthquake can be thought of as the release of a trigger, one that has been cocked slowly for years as strain builds up between two colliding tectonic plates. For some kinds of quakes, the longer the trigger is cocked, the stronger the earthquake will be when the plates finally slip past each other. That is the idea, anyway. In the case of the strongest earthquake ever recorded, a 9.5 magnitude quake in Chile in 1960, it did not seem to have held true. The amount of slip then was estimated to represent the build-up of 250 to 350 years' worth of friction between the Nazca and South American plates. Yet there had been an earthquake along the same fault just 123 years before, and another 100 years before that. A research team led by Marco Cisternas of the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaiso in Chile has cleared up the mystery. Those two earlier quakes, they report in the weekly journal Nature, did not release much of the stress. The 1960 quake, which killed hundreds of people in Chile and generated a tsunami that killed hundreds more on the Chilean coast and elsewhere in the Pacific, including Hawaii, occurred along a fault line about 600 miles long. By examining soils and sediment at a site about halfway along that line, the researchers were able to determine how much the land subsided during quakes, and the extent of tsunami damage, over 2,000 years. They found that the 1737 and 1837 quakes produced little subsidence and little in the way of tsunamis. By contrast, a 1575 quake, during the time of the conquistadors, produced tsunami deposits that were more extensive than those from 1960. So the researchers suggest that before 1960, the trigger was last fully released in 1575. The two intervening quakes did little to relieve the strain, which continued to build until the trigger was pulled again in 1960. All the Buzz Charles Darwin is best known for the theory of evolution, but he did much other scientific work as well. Through repeated observations of bees, for example, he proposed that bees outside the nest learn foraging tips by watching others. Since Darwin's time, scientists have learned that a great deal of information about foraging is communicated within the hive, through a ''waggle dance'' in which a bee tells hive mates where to find a food source, and outside the hive through the use of scent marks. But what of Darwin's original hypothesis? Bradley D. Worden and Daniel R. Papaj of the University of Arizona decided to test it, but they took the idea a step further. They wanted to see whether bees could learn about foraging from bees that were not from the same hive. They tested their idea with bumblebees, which have an advantage of having small hives, often with fewer than 100 workers. With so few foraging bees, the scientists thought it might be more likely that the insects would go outside the hive for information and help. Bees that had never fed on flowers were allowed to watch as unrelated bees (and in other experiments, artificial ones) foraged among orange or green flowers. In most cases, they chose the same color flowers that had been picked by the bees they watched. The results were published in the journal Biology Letters. This kind of social learning, the researchers suggest, might be important to bees in one colony by providing them with information about food sources discovered by another. Brief Encounter A Japanese spacecraft has made a rendezvous with a small asteroid about 175 million miles from Earth. If all goes well, the mission will be the first to return with a sample from the surface of a celestial body other than the Moon. The Hayabusa spacecraft, which was launched in 2003, will spend about three months surveying the asteroid, called Itokawa. It is less than a half-mile in its longest dimension. In November, it will make a quick landing, fire a projectile into the surface and gather ejected material to take back to Earth. A capsule containing the material -- hardly more than a thimbleful -- is to land in the Australian outback in June 2007. The Great Chorale of the Avian World The typical songbird is a solo artist, content to warble alone in a tree or on a wire. Some species, however, do the George Jones-Tammy Wynette duet thing, and there are even a few that sing in groups. But nothing quite matches the performance of the plain-tailed wren of Ecuador and Peru, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir of the avian world. Biologists at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland report that groups of the birds sing four-part songs, the males and females trading phrases with split-second timing for up to two minutes. ''I think this is the most complex song in a nonhuman animal,'' said Peter J. Slater, a professor of natural history and, along with Nigel I. Mann and Kimberly A. Dingess, author of a paper about the bird published in the journal Biology Letters. The plain-tailed wren is one of 28 species of a genus that the researchers are studying as part of a project on the evolution of singing patterns. Some species sing duets, with overlapping parts. ''But we came across this really quite extraordinary one,'' Dr. Slater said, on an Ecuadorean volcano. ''You get out of the car in the morning, and the whole hillside is ringing with these birds.'' The researchers teased the wrens out of their bamboo thickets and watched and recorded. They sang in groups of up to seven, the songs following an A-B-C-D pattern, with males singing the A and C phrases and females the B and D. The phrases follow in rapid succession with no overlapping, so that in effect it sounds like a single song. A sample is at nytimes.com/science. What makes the performance even more remarkable, Dr. Slater said, is that birds of each sex synchronize their parts. The males, for example, have 15 to 20 different A phrases they can sing. Yet two or more males in a group will sing the same phrase in almost perfect synchrony. Dr. Slater said several reasons were possible for this pattern. One involves reproduction. Since these are tropical birds, they do not use external factors like changing day length to know when to breed. So coordinating song like this may help synchronize reproduction, by stimulating hormones in the birds at the same time. But the birds also probably use their chorusing for defense. ''If you put a loudspeaker in the middle of these birds, they all gather around it and sing like mad,'' Dr. Slater said. ''It must be very intimidating for an intruding wren.'' Observatory"
"A powerful earthquake shook several villages in central Turkey today, killing at least 42 people, injuring more than 150 others and toppling dozens of buildings. The earthquake struck about 9 a.m. and had a magnitude of 6, the authorities said. It was felt 300 miles away. About 50 aftershocks followed, with the strongest registering 5.3, according to Ahmet Mete Isikara, chief of the seismological center at Kandilli Observatory in Istanbul. The earthquake was considerably weaker than the two that killed nearly 20,000 people in Turkey in 1999, but it was a reminder that much of the country rests atop a lacework of dangerous faults. During the last century, nearly 80,000 people have been killed in 56 major earthquakes in Turkey. The worst, in the eastern city of Erzincan in 1939, had a magnitude of 7.9 and killed 33,000 people. Many Turks live in fear of another major earthquake. The authorities said that many of the injuries today occurred when people jumped from buildings that they feared would tumble down. In Bolvadin, the town nearest the epicenter, a random patchwork of collapsed homes and other buildings could be seen in aerial shots from television helicopters. The top of a minaret had fallen through the roof of a mosque and men were kneeling in the street for afternoon prayers. The nearby village of Sultandagi had the greatest number of casualties, with at least 15 people dead, according to the Interior Ministry. Eleven people were crushed to death in the neighboring village of Cay. ''Because today is Sunday and shops are closed, a huge disaster was avoided,'' Public Works Minister Abdulkadir Akcan said in Ankara, the capital. The government was accused of being slow to respond to the devastating quakes of 1999. This time, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit rushed to the scene and warned residents not to return to damaged buildings in case of aftershocks. Emergency teams were dispatched from several parts of the country. Rescue workers in orange jumpsuits picked through the rubble of dozens of buildings, searching for survivors trapped in the wreckage. The government immediately sent 1,000 tents and 3,000 blankets to the region, about a three-hour drive from Ankara. Snow is on the ground in the area and temperatures well below freezing are expected tonight."
"Many of the 35 men at the Monday night meeting of the Long Ridge Fire Department jumped out of their seats. ''Then we ran outside to see what it was,'' said Chief Bob Bennett. ''But we didn't see anything.'' Then the phone calls started to come in. ''A number of people told us that they thought their oil burner had blown up, and ran down to the basement,'' Chief Bennett said. ''They were relieved to see that the burners hadn't blown up, but then they were puzzled. It was kind of a hard situation for us. People wanted answers, especially in this day and age, but we just didn't have one.'' They got their answer today. The sounds and shakes were a result of a tiny earthquake with a magnitude of 1.1, according to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, which monitors quake activity in the Northeast. The temblor occurred at 8:33 p.m., centered about five miles northwest of here, the observatory said. ''We picked it up right away,'' said Jeremiah Armitage, the network manager, ''but there was no one here to catch it.'' Mr. Armitage said that ''every couple of months there have been tiny ones here and there of this sort in the Northeast,'' but added that ''it has to be close to the surface and you have to be right on top of it to feel it.'' But the quake was felt in some areas of Greenwich, which borders Stamford. ''A couple of calls came in, and we did send out squad cars to the area,'' said Sgt. Timothy Berry of the Greenwich police, ''but we've fielded more press calls about it today than we did calls from residents last night.'' Pat Jorgenson, a spokeswoman for the United States Geological Survey, noted that in California, such an earthquake probably would not have been felt at all, but that in the Northeast, ''with its bedrock of hard granite, sometimes the lighter ones feel like a hammer hitting a rock -- boing!'' Other recent earthquakes in the New York region have been more severe, yet still minor: one with a magnitude of 2.6 in Manhattan last October, and another measured at 2.5 that shook Putnam and Fairfield Counties in August 2000. At a magnitude of 1.1, Monday night's earthquake was not felt in New Jersey or New York, but that is not to say it was an easy night for the authorities here. Chief Bennett sent out patrols to look for a downed plane, but found nothing. ''Sometimes,'' the chief said, ''we just stand around scratching our heads, too.''"
"The Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan, at the intersection of the Indian and Asian tectonic plates, is one of the most earthquake-prone in the world. In an average year, five earthquakes with a magnitude of 5.0 or stronger strike within 100 miles of the location of Monday's earthquake. On March 3, a quake with a magnitude of 7.2 struck the same region, killing about 150 people. But because the epicenter was 150 miles below the surface, the quake's energy dissipated before it reached the surface, limiting the destruction. The Monday earthquake was less strong -- the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., measured it at a magnitude of 6.1 -- but far deadlier, because it struck only about three miles below the surface. ''The energy was closer to the buildings,'' said Dr. John F. Shroder, a professor of geology at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and an expert on Afghanistan's geology. Based on the pattern of shaking measured on distant seismographs, scientists at the National Earthquake Information Center believe that the earthquake occurred along a north-south fault, but they have not yet identified the fault. India, once an island to the east of Africa, crashed into the underside of Asia about 45 million years ago, and the two tectonic plates continue to push together at rate of nearly two inches a year, creating a rugged landscape of high mountains and deep valleys. The crash shattered the earth's crust into a fragmented network of short faults rather than a long fault like the San Andreas Fault in California, where two plates slide past each other. Dr. Terry Wallace, a professor of seismology at the University of Arizona, said the March 3 quake probably did not cause the quake on Monday. ''It's more likely to be a coincidence,'' he said. Exploding bombs are not the cause, either. ''They're just not large enough to be causing any earthquakes,'' said Waverly Person, a geophysicist at the United States Geological Survey. A NATION CHALLENGED: THE GEOLOGY"
"An earthquake and its aftershocks have razed a city and several villages in remote northeast Afghanistan, with initial reports saying it killed as many as 2,000 people and left legions without homes. The earthquake struck early Monday evening, and reports from the region, in the mountains of the Hindu Kush, said it had wiped out Nahrin, a densely populated district capital of mud-brick huts that has been filling up with refugees returning home. ''The whole city of Nahrin has been completely destroyed,'' said Yusuf Nuristani, a government spokesman, who said he had been in touch with rescue workers via satellite telephone. ''If you were there, you would see rubble, destroyed houses and lots of displaced people -- chaos.'' The Hindu Kush was a heavily mined front line in Afghanistan's decades of civil war but the quake area had not been involved in recent months. Officials in Kabul estimated that up to 2,000 people had died and more than 4,000 had been injured. People from nearby villages were reportedly wandering into Nahrin in search of cloth to wrap the bodies of family members, suggesting that the toll could be higher once the damage in rural reaches is surveyed. A United Nations team in the area reported that five villages, Tawasha, Dala, Shar-i-Kuna, Kasabihan and Arakash, had been severely damaged, and that 800 people might have died in those places. One United Nations official reported that as many as 10,000 people had been driven from their homes. Still, there were other suggestions that the quakes might not have been as deadly as originally feared. Speaking by satellite phone from Nahrin, an official with Acted, a French aid agency based there, told the BBC that large swathes of the town were still standing and that the estimates of 2,000 dead might be high. Initial reports suggested that the earthquake and aftershocks were relatively moderate. The National Earthquake Information Center of the United States Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., reported that the quake had a magnitude of 6.1 and that it had struck at 7:26 p.m. Monday, local time. Aftershocks rumbled in Kabul well past sunrise today. The Golden center said the epicenter was only three miles beneath the surface. The typical Afghan village is a collection of mud-brick huts with wood-beam roofs, so the tremors, though moderate, could have caused heavy damage. Word of the disaster sent the fledgling Afghan government and aid agencies scurrying to move medicine and tents into the city, only about 100 miles north of Kabul but hard to reach. Throughout the day, helicopters laden with food rose from the airport here, and convoys of trucks full of medicine and tents rumbled out of the city. The Afghan government and the dozens of aid workers based here had been focused on beginning the ambitious task of reviving Afghanistan from the ruins of war, but the earthquake served as a reminder that in its impoverished state, the country is vulnerable to nature. The earthquake seemed certain to tax the meager resources of the government, which took over just three months ago after the collapse of the Taliban and has been unable even to pay most of its civil servants. Mr. Nuristani said the government intended to spend $600,000 on disaster relief. Hamid Karzai, the interim leader, canceled a visit to Turkey to deal with the disaster. The international force assigned to maintain order in Kabul sent a helicopter full of soldiers toward Nahrin and declared themselves willing to help. By the end of the day, with the helicopters and convoys headed to the area, the relief effort seemed to gather steam. Acted, the French agency, said it had sent 2,000 tents and 1,000 blankets and was dispatching another 1,500 shelter and medicine kits. The World Food Program said it had sent 175 tons of food. The United Nations refugee agency allocated 500 tents; Unicef said it was providing 70 tons of food and other aid. Aid workers based in the area and those who arrived today by helicopter and four-wheel-drive trucks said the Nahrin district was in ruins. Ros O'Sullivan, an official with the aid agency Concern, said members of his group had reached Nahrin and found it ''90 percent destroyed.'' The headquarters of Acted were destroyed. Aid workers in Pul-i-Kumri said an Afghan official had arrived in their town and reported that nearly everyone in his village of 800 people had died. Northeastern Afghanistan lies in an seismologically active region that has been hit by numerous earthquakes in recent years. In 1998 two quakes killed about 7,000 Afghans, with hundreds killed by landslides that buried entire villages. Earlier this month, an earthquake centered in neighboring Samangan Province killed about 100 people. Government officials worried that relief efforts would be hampered by the inaccessibility of the region. The main access road into Nahrin was said to be blocked for at least part of the day. The closest airport, in Kunduz, was bombed by American jets during the war and is unfit for large planes. There was talk among officials of beseeching the American troops stationed at Bagram Air Base, north of Kabul, to helicopter supplies to the stricken area. At Bagram an American spokesman, Maj. Bryan Hilferty, said a team had been sent to assess whether troops could play a role in rescue and recovery efforts, The Associated Press reported. The area around Nahrin is also said to be packed with land mines laid during the civil war between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance. Nahrin was on the front line between the two armies in the last years of that war, and Northern Alliance soldiers laid hundreds of antitank mines on the roads leading into the town, said Guy Willoughby, director of the HALO Trust, which specializes in removing mines. The earthquakes, hitting Afghanistan just as it begins to emerge from 23 years of nearly uninterrupted warfare, had an almost surreal resonance in the capital. Ravaged by war, Afghanistan has fallen victim in recent years to famine, plague, droughts and floods as well. In the north, aid officials were preparing this year for an onslaught of locusts. At a news conference today at the presidential palace, Mr. Nuristani, the spokesman, entertained an extraordinary question. ''Is Afghanistan cursed?'' a reporter asked. ''No,'' Mr. Nuristani replied. A NATION CHALLENGED: DISASTER"
"Q. Could the bombing of Afghanistan have resulted in recent earthquakes there? A. There is only a remote possibility of a seismic effect from the reported bombing, said Dr. Arthur Lerner-Lam, an associate director at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. ''The energy of one ton of explosive is roughly equivalent to the energy released in an earthquake of magnitude 1.5 or 2,'' Dr. Lerner-Lam said, ''but that assumes a ton of dynamite exploded under ideal circumstances, in an enclosed cavern in hard rock.'' The energy released from a one-ton bomb would instead diffuse on the surface, he explained, because bombs are designed to destroy things on the surface, not to shake the rock below. Some bombs are made to destroy underground sites, he said, ''but in even the largest of these, the energy release is not large in comparison to a significant quake.'' ''However,'' Dr. Lerner-Lam noted, ''there is evidence that a large nuclear explosion can change stress fields in the earth's crust.'' Such changes can bring on some earthquake activity, or at least changes in the natural background seismicity, he said. ''But the punch line is, Afghanistan is among the most seismically active countries in the world, so such quakes are likely without large bombing campaigns, unless there are large nuclear explosions we don't know about.''

"On the road in, the wreckage pointed the way. The hamlets lay in ruins, Logani, Hafezbacha, Shar-i-Kuna and Arakash, reduced to rock and sand by an earthquake whose aftershocks kept beating into the day. Villagers rifled the rubble with their hands, searching for the living and dragging out the dead. Others wandered about in rags, mumbling and moaning. Cows and goats trailed after them. ''We have to try to bear our misery,'' said a man named Ghandagha, weeping amid the rubble. His children, ages 7, 10 and 13, were dead in the ruins. Such was the wreckage that revealed itself today across this broad plateau in northern Afghanistan, decimated by an earthquake earlier this week. As relief workers poured into the area, the numbers and estimates bandied about since the quake struck Monday night assumed a human form today, much like that of Mr. Ghandagha, broken and sad and seated amid the ruins. Rescue workers combing the wreckage declared today that far fewer people appeared to have died in the earthquake than was initially believed, probably no more than 1,000. That was a substantially smaller number than was estimated even a day before, when relief officials here predicted that as many as 2,000 people, maybe more, had been killed. Nigel Fisher, the deputy director of the United Nations special mission to Afghanistan, said the lower figure was reached after a survey of some 78 villages in the area around Nahrin. ''Given the size of the earthquake, I think we're fortunate that far more people were not killed,'' Mr. Fisher said after a helicopter trip to the devastated area. The new estimates offered little succor to the thousands of people here who lost homes and family members in the quake, which had a magnitude of 6.1. Rescue workers estimated that about 7,000 families were homeless and that the homes of 13,000 more had been severely damaged. Even as villagers struggled with their freshly overturned lives, aftershocks continued to rock the area, a dozen of them in all. One of the tremors had a magnitude of 5.1, rattling the earth for miles, sending plumes of dust into the air across the horizon. Many villagers, still stunned from the quake on Monday, shrieked and sobbed as the ground beneath them began to rumble again. One of the tremors loosed a boulder, perhaps 12 feet high, which rolled down the mountainside and onto the valley floor. There was nothing left for it to destroy. House after mud-brick house in this city lay in ruins, each one a family's shattered universe: a teapot, a stove, a carpet or a shoe, smashed and broken and covered in dust. The villagers stood, staring. Some of them held injured children. Fresh graves lined the road. In Nahrin, a group of men and women sat in the open air looking after a 7-year-old boy and his grandmother. In the chaos of the quake, she had grabbed the boy and yanked him through a window. Four of the boy's sisters and one brother had died inside. The boy's parents were still missing. Hamid Karzai, chairman of the caretaker government, flew by helicopter to Nahrin today and said he was stunned by what he saw. Journalists flying into the area saw decimated hamlets beneath them, with villagers standing amid the ruins and calling skyward for help. Mr. Karzai declared Thursday a national day of mourning for the earthquake's victims and ordered his subordinates to hand out cash to the families who had suffered the most. Few here seemed able to comprehend what had happened. Bibi Gul, 40, was cooking dinner for her family when the ground began to move. ''I was sitting next to the stove when everything started shaking,'' Ms. Gul said. ''Then the house collapsed and the stove was on top of me.'' Ms. Gul lay in the rubble of her home for more than 24 hours before someone found her. The skin on her face had been burned black. She was taken to the nearest hospital, a three-hour drive down the mountains on a rutted road. She spoke as a doctor applied a white salve to her skin. A drip ran into her arm. By the end of the day, rescue workers said that about 700 bodies had been pulled from the rubble. Farana Faruki, a United Nations official in Nahrin, said she was confident that most of the bodies had been found. Relief officials said the lower death toll was attributable, at least in part, to the primitive homes that are the standard dwelling for most of the people on this broad plateau. Few of the buildings stood higher than a single floor, so there was relatively little rubble to be buried beneath. The most badly injured were taken to the Nasaji Hospital in Pul-i-Kumri. The victims, who lay on grimy beds atop concrete floors, waited in silence as doctors and nurses scurried about them. One of the injured was Mazary, the wife of a peasant farmer called Hamisha, who lived in the village of Shar-i-Kuna. When the ground began to shake, Ms. Mazary said, she ran for the door. But it was too late, and her home collapsed around her. The stove fell and burned her leg. After she managed to get out of the house, she looked around for her children. She found her two sons and then rushed back to the rubble. Her daughters, ages 12, 13 and 15, were dead inside. Neighbors came, and they buried the three girls beside the ruined home. Ms. Mazary told much of her story without emotion, staring listlessly ahead. But when she spoke of her daughters, she began to weep. ''We are poor people, my husband is just a farmer,'' she said, her face streaked with tears. ''But it is just from God and there is nothing we can do.'' As Ms. Mazary spoke, a team of men from the Afghan Finance Ministry were moving from bed to bed, doling out stacks of Afghan currency. Most of the patients, impoverished though they are, stared into space. The scene at Nasaji Hospital highlighted the difficulty of confronting a disaster in a country as impoverished as this one. It is grim place of dirty sheets and bare concrete floors. In a corner, a group of doctors crouched around a 30-year-old Soviet-made X-ray machine, arguing over images so opaque that none of them seemed able to determine whether this or that bone had been broken. ''We don't have medicine,'' said Shawali Ahmedzai, the director of the hospital. ''We don't have money.'' The earthquake has posed a challenge to the Karzai administration, which was struggling before the quake to carry out the most routine functions of government. Indeed, the relief effort, though nominally headed by the Afghans, was spearheaded by Western aid agencies and the United Nations, and countries like the United States, Japan and Germany all promised to pitch in money and other aid. Relief supplies poured into the area, and by the end of the day, officials said there was enough food in the area to feed families there for about three months. Yet even that, they said, would not be enough. Officials here said the earthquake had shattered any hope that the area, stricken by war and drought, would be able to plant crops this spring. By nightfall, there were signs that the villagers here were beginning to adjust. Families pulled carpets from the ruins, hung them over ropes and fashioned crude tents. Others milled about, swapping stories. One man walked out of the rubble holding a live chicken in each hand. A NATION CHALLENGED: DISASTER"
"A moderately powerful earthquake rumbled up the Eastern Seaboard yesterday, causing no injuries but damaging roads and breaking windows in upstate New York while shaking people out of sleep from Maine to Maryland. The quake, which struck at 6:50 a.m., had a magnitude of 5.1 with its epicenter about 15 miles southwest of Plattsburgh, N.Y., according to the United States Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center. It could be felt as far away as Boston in the east, the Canadian border to the north, west to Buffalo and as far south as Baltimore, a statement released by the center said. In Brooklyn, it felt as if the subway train were rolling by. Gov. George E. Pataki said he could feel the quake in the Executive Mansion in Albany. By noon yesterday, Clinton and Essex Counties in upstate New York had declared states of emergency as officials there received reports of damage including water main breaks, collapsed roads and fallen chimneys. A 200-foot portion of Route 9N collapsed in the town AuSable, 12 miles south of Plattsburgh, and County Road 39 in nearby Harkness was also damaged, said Don Maurer, the spokesman for the State Emergency Management Office. Mr. Maurer said about 1,500 people in the town of Jay lost power for a few hours. He added that the State Department of Transportation would begin checking all roads and bridges in the area around the epicenter. Several dams in the region had already been checked, he said, and were found to be undamaged. Hannah Deming, 40, lives in Keeseville, a few miles from the epicenter. She had just sat down to have a morning cup of coffee with her husband, Jon, when she heard a sudden, terrible racket that sounded, she said, like a furnace about to explode. ''There were these incredible pops and bangs,'' Mrs. Deming recalled. ''It sounded like the house was about to blow.'' Although some witnesses said the tremors lasted no more than 30 seconds, Mrs. Deming said they went on for perhaps two minutes -- long enough for her husband to place their daughter Grace in the car, run back inside the house for a cellphone, come out again, and run back in for the car keys. The quake, she said, had cracked their concrete-block house from foundation to roof. Barbara Earle was visiting her cousin Brian Bourgeois at his refurbished farmhouse up the road from the Demings' home. ''This old house shook good,'' Ms. Earle said. ''We definitely felt it. ''We've got family in Syracuse and Long Island, and they both called. Both of them felt this thing where they were, too.'' In October, an earthquake with a magnitude of 2.6 was recorded in New York City, with its epicenter on the east side of Manhattan, just north of the Queensboro Bridge. Dr. Frank Revetta, a professor of geology at the State University of New York College at Potsdam, said there had not been an earthquake so large in the Plattsburgh area since 1983. That year, a quake similar to yesterday's struck near Blue Mountain Lake, he said. The Plattsburgh area, Dr. Revetta said, is in what is known as the Northern New York-Western Quebec Seismic Zone, a belt of land that extends from the Adirondacks into Canada and is given to small earthquakes that typically measure a magnitude of 2 to 4. Dr. Revetta said yesterday's quake provided him a chance to feel personally the effects of a decent-size earthquake. ''It was actually kind of scary,'' he said. ''The house just kept shaking and shaking and shaking.''"
"Another earthquake hit northern Afghanistan today, killing at least 30 people and injuring nearly 100, further crippling an area devastated in a quake three weeks ago. Aid workers helped pull bodies from the rubble of houses in two villages in the quake-prone mountainous region of the Hindu Kush, just a few miles from Nahrin, a town 90 miles north of Kabul that was leveled in the quake on March 25. ''There are two villages affected, Doabi and Khoja Khesir,'' said Muhammad Mahir Yaqobi, coordinator for the French relief organization Acted, which sent a team to the area. ''So far 30 people are dead and 95 wounded.'' A United Nations official in Mazar-i-Sharif, Fahrana Faruqi, said the quake had also hit other villages, including Nahrin itself, The Associated Press reported. She put the overall death toll at at least 37, with 120 people injured. The quake three weeks ago killed hundreds, and left homeless the entire Nahrin population of tens of thousands. They are now living in tents. Casualty figures remain incomplete, and the estimated toll varies between 500 and 800 dead. The magnitude of the quake today was a relatively modest 5.8, the United Nations mission in Afghanistan reported. Yet it was felt in Mazar-i-Sharif and the capital, Kabul. As with the last one, it was close to the surface and so appeared to cause heavy damage close to its epicenter. Survivors are so shaken that they are talking of leaving the region altogether rather than rebuilding, Mr. Yaqobi added. ''God is still angry with us,'' he said, alluding to Afghanistan's persistent state of crisis."
"Magnificent Obsessions What do Soviet cars, bizarre album covers and Lego instruction sheets have in common? The Web, of course, where the collecting compulsion meets its natural handmaiden: the personal home page. The Museum of Online Museums (www.coudal.com/archives /museum.html) is a small but potentially important effort to highlight distinctive personal collections that are exhibited online. The site is sponsored by a prominent Web design firm, Coudal Partners. Although the site offers links to the home pages of brick-and-mortar museums, it describes its Galleries section, which showcases personal sites, as ''where all the good stuff is.'' (Don't miss the annex, which directs visitors to the most recent ''acquisitions,'' like the Gallery of Unfortunate Christmas Cards and the Condiment Packet Museum.) The curator of MoOM, as it is called, is Kevin Guilfoile, a writer and designer. Since there must be thousands, if not tens of thousands, of such collections online, what are the site's criteria? ''It's entirely arbitrary and decided on the spot,'' Mr. Guilfoile said. ''Sometimes it's just an equation like banality-times-quantity.'' One membership ID for a skateboarding park ''is not especially interesting,'' he said, ''but 400 of them, organized by state, is really compelling.'' The presentation or the collector's passion can make a difference, he said. Mr. Guilfoile, whose favorite galleries include those of manhole covers and firecracker labels, said that such collections take on a special meaning when offered on the Web: ''It's a statement about yourself: 'I'm the kind of person who collects lots and lots of Japanese milk bottle pull tabs and, more than that, I believe these are the best ones.' '' Faces Lost and Found Speaking of online collections, there is a growing appetite for found objects, particularly photographs. A recent Wired News article said that anonymous photographs were being auctioned on eBay for $10 to $40. For some, found photos are simply entertaining (www.spillway.com /found/index5.html). For others, they are art (www.renewal.org .au/object/photos). A university professor, struck by the image of an unknown woman smiling into a mirror that appears to date from about a century ago, is asking visitors to the site to create stories about her (www .people.virginia.edu/ds8s/abby.html). At least one site recognizes the essential nature of found photographs: they have been lost. Is This You? (www.isthisyou.co.uk) seeks to reunite subjects with their mislaid images. More than 50 photographs are displayed at this somewhat wistful, somewhat playful site, which says that they were collected from ''photo booths and pavements all over the U.K.'' The creator of Is This You?, Reuben Turner, 31, of London, said that the site was meant to evoke the anonymity and randomness of modern life. ''Many, many people have claimed to have found themselves, some with quite vivid stories and descriptions,'' he said. ''Suffice to say, I haven't heard a credible claim yet'' -- until last week, that is. A Japanese photo ID card was claimed by a woman who said it was stolen in London last year. Mr. Turner tends to believe her, and he is ecstatic: ''All I ever wanted was for someone to see themselves on the site and experience that flash of recognition, that moment of synchronicity that happens only a very few times in any life.''

The earthquake on Saturday in upstate New York, which registered 5.1 on the scale of magnitude, was the biggest in the state in nearly 20 years. My 6-year-old will never forgive himself for sleeping through it, especially since it was among the ''most felt'' quakes recorded to date by the Web site Did You Feel It? (pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/shake), founded three years ago. The site, operated by the United States Geological Survey, collects data on earthquakes from the people who experience them. The result is a Community Internet Intensity Map that can be created within minutes of a quake and continuously updated online. ''The system is fully automatic and is completely dependent on the response of the Internet community,'' said David J. Wald, a seismologist for the Geological Survey in Pasadena, Calif., who created the nationwide project. Such information is especially important in the Northeast, he added, ''where we don't have many seismic stations.'' In the past, gathering data on seismic intensity (as opposed to magnitude, which is measured by a seismograph) took months and depended on questionnaires mailed by the Geological Survey to the affected ZIP-code areas. The Web site has received more than 8,300 reports on last weekend's quake, which was centered just southwest of Plattsburgh, N.Y., and was felt from Maine to New Jersey. ''Quite often people play around,'' Mr. Wald said of the crank factor involved. ''However, we find that after a real earthquake, the number of responsible entries greatly dominates the answers, and we have ways of filtering out suspicious entries.''

"TO protect children from harm in an earthquake, California legislators have for years been voting ever tougher structural requirements for new schools. But good intentions can have a high price: eliminating any possibility of earthquake injury poses other risks. To see how, go to Second Street and Hobart Boulevard in Los Angeles any morning at 6:30. There, 1,800 immigrant children line up outside Cahuenga Elementary School. The children live nearby, but Cahuenga has no room for them, and the earthquake rules have made it very hard to add new classroom space in the neighborhood. So aides guide these children onto buses for rides of up to an hour or more, to 30 schools outside the central city where seats are available. The educational as well as transportation costs of this routine are evident. The pupils are bused to schools that usually don't offer the Spanish- or Korean-language help that Cahuenga provides. Many, of low income, get free breakfast at school after the buses drop them off, but when the buses arrive late (rain or traffic accidents can tie up Los Angeles freeways), breakfast is delayed and lessons must then be skipped. Further, while educators say parent involvement in school can raise achievement, busing precludes it for most of this neighborhood's families. Schools are too distant for parents to attend conferences or volunteer in classes and school activities. The transportation itself poses risks. About 52,000 of Los Angeles's 737,000 students are bused from overcrowded schools, for a total of 40 million miles of student busing a year. With so much busing, a serious accident is almost inevitable; the chances of severe injury from a bus crash could be as great as from an earthquake. California has greater earthquake risk than most states, so high structural standards are needed. But the added protection that the existing codes afford is tiny compared with the harm done children from the absence of a local school. Though earthquake safety is a special concern in California, failure to consider hidden trade-offs is a problem in much of the country. In New York City, which is also afflicted by school overcrowding, construction is impeded by requirements that apply to the addition of classroom space. For example, the Board of Education insists that all electrical wiring in new schools be encased in metal tubing, a requirement far beyond what state and municipal building codes demand. One block from Cahuenga here in Los Angeles is a four-story medical building. It was empty two years ago, and district officials hoped to acquire it for a small school. The building is certainly deemed safe for those who seek treatment there, including the elderly and children. But it could not be used as a school, because it did not comply with the state mandates, applicable to schools only, that among other things require inspectors to be present continuously during construction to ensure that each hidden joint is earthquake-proof. Other well-intentioned policies also hinder construction. A civil rights settlement obliges Los Angeles not to build schools of lesser quality in the central city than in the suburbs. This means that new schools must have full playgrounds, for instance, a hard condition to meet in overcrowded areas. Charter schools are not subject to those conditions. Not far from Cahuenga is a charter school, Camino Nuevo Academy, built in response to parents who wanted their children educated near home. Camino Nuevo occupies a converted two-level strip mall. Architects designed the conversion to be earthquake-proof, but district officials did not consider it for a regular school because it nonetheless violates school construction and playground rules. If officials resolve to overcome such obstacles, they can probably do so. Here in California, Gov. Gray Davis and the Los Angeles superintendent of schools, Roy Romer, have now vowed to try to roll back the most restrictive rules, or have them waived for particular projects, despite the reluctance of some legislators to cast votes that opponents will charge endanger children. Enrollment at Cahuenga for the next school year's kindergarten will soon begin, with places going to neighborhood families who apply first. Hundreds of parents will camp on the sidewalk for days in advance, hoping that their children won't have to be bused across the city. These children should be protected from earthquakes, but from other harm as well. LESSONS"
"A microphone in the Pacific Ocean near Wake Island recorded a 45-second, low-frequency roar, too low to be heard by human ears. It was the sound of nearly a cubic mile of sediment giving way along an ocean bottom slope 2,200 miles away off Papua New Guinea. That recently examined recording is the latest evidence that an underwater landslide, not an earthquake, churned up the 30-foot-high tsunami that crashed onto coastal villages of Papua New Guinea on July 17, 1998, killing more than 2,100 people. Once thought rare, landslide-generated tsunamis have caught the attention of geologists, who now look with concern at other continental shelves that could collapse with equal disaster. Three-dimensional maps of the bottom of Monterey Bay off California, for example, show several sections that have given way -- and others that have cracked and may collapse in the future. What is not known is how often landslides occur and how many tumble fast enough to induce tsunamis. Small landslides -- or ones that slip slowly -- do not cause tsunamis. Cataclysmic landslides, like the partial collapse of a midocean volcano, generate giant waves that scour thousands of miles of coastline around an entire ocean basin, but they occur very rarely, once every few hundred thousand years. But moderate-size underwater landslides like the one off Papua New Guinea may pose an uneasily plausible risk in some places, occurring once every few hundred years. ''It is a reasonably significant hazard,'' said Dr. Emile A. Okal, a professor of geological sciences at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. Almost immediately after it happened, scientists realized the Papua New Guinea tsunami was unusual. An offshore earthquake of magnitude 7.0 preceded the waves, but earthquakes that size strike that area every year or two; only the 1998 one was accompanied by a tsunami. The deadly devastation was also confined to a 15-mile stretch of the coast; villages only a few miles east or west escaped almost unscathed. That led to speculation that the earthquake had shaken loose a landslide that in turn caused the tsunami. Surveys of the ocean bottom found freshly collapsed sediment that slid nearly a mile down a 25-degree slope. Other scientists argued that a vertical thrust of the sea floor during the earthquake directly caused the tsunami, but that the amphitheater-shaped depression around the epicenter focused the waves onto the small section of the shoreline. In the latest work, Dr. Okal examined the sound recordings from Wake Island, which captured a low-frequency rumble (measured at seven hertz) that lasted 45 seconds. In the ocean, sound waves can reflect off layers of water of different temperatures, allowing them to travel long distances without fading out. Earthquakes can generate similar low rumbles, but those last only about 10 seconds, Dr. Okal said. The findings were reported in the April 8 issue of The Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. ''For the first time, we are able to identify a landslide from its acoustic signature,'' said Dr. Costas E. Synolakis, a professor of civil engineering at the University of Southern California and lead author of the paper. Seismic stations on several Pacific islands also recorded the acoustic rumblings. Tracing the path the sound waves took, Dr. Synolakis, Dr. Okal and their colleagues concluded that the rumble came from a landslide that occurred 13 minutes after the earthquake. That, the scientists said, agrees with accounts from survivors who said the tsunami followed the first large aftershock, 20 minutes after the earthquake. It also rules out the earthquake as the cause because the waves would not have taken that long to travel the 20 miles from the epicenter to the shore. ''We had to find a source which happened 10 to 15 minutes after the main shock,'' Dr. Okal said. Eric L. Geist, a research geophysicist at the United States Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., described the paper as a ''very intriguing line of research,'' but not definitive proof of the landslide theory. ''It's certainly a plausible story,'' he said. ''We just have no way of verifying it instrumentally right now.'' Mr. Geist said the earthquake, or one of its aftershocks, must have also caused a tsunami because instruments in Japan thousands of miles away detected it, a quick-moving wave a few inches high. Landslide-generated tsunamis dissipate quickly and do not travel that far. He added that in the chaos, the witnesses could have mistaken the sequence of events. The theory that underwater landslides can set off tsunamis dates back more than a century. In recent decades, tsunami researchers shifted their attention to offshore earthquakes, still thought to be the cause of most tsunamis. But after Papua New Guinea, scientists thought they might have underestimated the dangers of landslides. In 2000, scientists at Pennsylvania State University warned of unstable, waterlogged sediments under the seabed off New Jersey. The weight of rocks above could potentially blow the sediments out the side of the continental slope like a stepped-on water balloon, causing a landslide and a tsunami. Scientists also see potential collapses in places like the mouth of the St. Lawrence River where sediment from the river piles up. In 1929, a 7.2 earthquake toppled part of the sediment pile, causing a tsunami. Underwater landslides have also occurred off the coast of California. In Monterey Bay, ''you see large numbers of bites taken out of the canyon essentially,'' said Dr. Steven N. Ward, a research geophysicist at the University of California at Santa Cruz. ''Some look very fresh. Some look very old. Some look like they haven't happened yet.'' The canyon is cracked in some places, Dr. Ward said, and even a small earthquake near a crack could set off a landslide. Most of the slides in Monterey Bay are small -- only about a fortieth the volume of the Papua New Guinea landslide -- but because they occur very close to shore, they could still create 15- to 20-foot-high waves that strike a small portion of the coast. ''Ten miles up or down the coast, you won't see it,'' he said. ''It's big, but it's fairly local.'' To better understand how sliding sediments create tsunamis, Dr. Synolakis and his colleagues conducted experiments earlier this month at Oregon State University. In what looks like a small swimming pool, they slid a wedged-shaped block down the slanted bottom of the pool and measured the size of the waves. They varied the weight of the wedge between 200 and 1,000 pounds by adding lead weights. The measurements show that, contrary to earlier beliefs, that the largest waves are not caused by the push of the wedge. ''The big thing is sucking water down'' behind the sliding wedge, Dr. Synolakis said. ''Now we find most of the energy is expended in creating the wave on the back end of the slide,'' which head in the opposite direction -- toward the shore."
"The great basilicas of Italy house some of the most important sculpture, painting and craft work in Western art. One of the most prized holdings -- a series of 13th-century ceiling frescoes by the ground-breaking painters Giotto and Cimabue -- was thought to be forever lost when an earthquake ravaged the basilica of St. Francis in the town of Assisi five years ago. Those who have visited this soaring structure since the restoration was unveiled last month are relieved to see that the pessimists were wrong. When the quake settled, the ceiling frescoes lay shattered on the floor in tens of thousands of puzzle-like pieces that were mixed in with general debris. The restoration was carried out by a team of professionals, students and volunteers who were willing to sift through the rubble endlessly, often going for days at a time without finding a single fragment of an artwork. The saints emerged gradually with the discovery of an eye, a nose or a few wisps of hair. Though somewhat diminished, frescoes of several of the figures in the chapel's ceiling have now been put back into recognizable form. St. Jerome has lost most of his beard; his cloak is eaten with holes, but it is nonetheless inspiring to see that he has risen from the rubble. The famous wall panels depicting the life of St. Francis -- which are also attributed to Giotto -- have been fully restored. The 13th-century basilica has been braced with high-tech devices that will help it to resist new tremors, and it is likely to stand for many centuries more. The first phase of the restoration was celebrated recently on the fifth anniversary of the quake. Yet to be tackled is the fresco of St. Matthew -- by Cimabue, a seminal figure in Italian painting -- which was reduced to more than 100,000 fragments that are currently stored in boxes. A computer program will be used to help restorers piece together the fresco in virtual reality before moving it physically into place. The restoration will go on for years. But that effort is the least the contemporary world can do for the great artists who devoted years and even decades to individual works that have come to define the Western aesthetic."
"I had been hosting a radio call-in show in China and listening to women tell me their stories for three and a half years when I went to visit Tangshan in 1992. The city had been rebuilt after the terrible earthquake of 1976, in which as many as 300,000 people may have died. Once there, I heard about an unusual orphanage founded and run by mothers who had lost their children during the disaster. One mother agreed to recount her tale as long as I promised her anonymity. Since the tragedy, she had been asked many times about her loss. She wanted this time to be the last. ''My husband died a year before the earthquake, and my daughter and I lived in a fifth-floor flat,'' the woman began. ''We had only one room. Because I hate extremes of heat and cold, my half of it was by the inner wall, and my daughter's was by the outer wall. That morning, I was woken by rumbling, banging and violent shaking. Everything was tilting. Suddenly, the wall by my daughter disappeared, and we were exposed on the edge of the fifth floor. It was very warm, so we were only in our underclothes. My daughter screamed and wrapped her arms around her chest, but before she could react more fully, she was thrown over the edge by another falling wall. ''I looked frantically for a way to get downstairs and staggered off, shouting my daughter's name. As people gradually realized the full horror of the situation, a grieving silence fell. We surveyed the scene before us: collapsed buildings, broken water pipes, yawning holes in the ground, corpses everywhere. A pall of dust and smoke was rising. There was no sun or moon. We wondered if we were still in the land of the living. ''Someone shouted, 'Look over there, someone's alive!' In the wan light, we saw a girl wedged in midair between the ruined walls of two buildings. I knew from the color and style of her bra, and from the struggling movement of her torso, that she was my daughter. I called her name over and over, wild with joy and grief. She continued writhing desperately, and I realized that she could not hear or see me. People started trying to scale the wall my daughter was trapped in, but it was at least two stories high, and they had no tools. She had still not heard me. Soon everyone was calling: 'Xiao Yun! Xiao Yun!' ''She raised her head and used her free hand -- her left -- to push her hair off her face. She waved to me with her free hand. I don't know how long we spent calling and waving. In retrospect, I wonder why she never screamed for me to save her. She never said anything like 'Mama, save me.' Not a word. ''Someone shouted to Xiao Yun, 'It's 5:30 in the morning; there will be someone coming soon.' He wanted her to hold on. But minutes and hours passed, and nobody came to the rescue. What kind of a country was this in 1976? Hundreds of thousands had died, yet no one knew. How backward China was. If we had been more advanced, Xiao Yun might have survived. ''I can't say for sure when the rescuers arrived. The army came first. Equipped with ropes and pitons, two soldiers started to climb the wall. The soldiers started pulling away the bricks and stones around Xiao Yun, and soon freed her right arm, which was bruised and bloody. They suddenly stopped digging. After a while, they came down and walked over to me. Gesturing with bloodied hands, they told me that the lower half of her body was wedged between reinforced concrete slabs. They said that they were not allowed to use tools to dig people free, for fear of hurting them. The heavy rescue equipment couldn't get to the city because the roads were destroyed. How much could they do by hand? Food and medicine were brought to her every day. She waited 14 days and 2 hours, knowing death was approaching. ''Xiao Yun used to howl over a scratch from a branch and blanch at the sight of blood. But in those last 14 days, she was so strong. The soldiers helped me to climb the wall up to Xiao Yun and piled up a makeshift seat for me so I could sit holding her in my arms. Her small, weak body was icy cold, though it was summer. For the first few days, Xiao Yun could still talk to me, and waved her hands about as she told stories. After the fourth day, she grew weaker and weaker, until she could barely lift her head. ''On the 14th day, she sat up. All the strangers who had been watching her attentively started clapping and cheering. I thought a miracle had happened, too. Her face, which had been deadly pale, flushed bright red, and she spoke to her well-wishers in a clear, loud voice. Somebody suggested that she sing a song. At first, Xiao Yun was shy, but at last, she started singing: 'The red star is shining with a marvelous light, the red star is shining in my heart. . . . ' Many people started to sing along. For the first time in days, people were smiling. After a few verses, Xiao Yun's voice faltered, and she slowly sank back into my arms. I thought she was sleeping, but when I realized my mistake, it was too late.'' LIVES Xinran is the author of ''The Good Women of China: Hidden Voices,'' from which this piece is adapted.

"PETER MAGOWAN will not predict there will be no earthquake during the three World Series games here. What Magowan, the owner of the Giants, does say is that the friendly new playground was built to withstand a very big one -- a relief for anybody who thinks about such things. Most people in the Bay Area are in a necessary state of denial about the earthquake known as the Big One, which seismologists insist is coming one of these decades. The subject does interest anybody who has already seen a stadium shimmy and shake while containing a World Series crowd, which happened on Oct. 17, 1989, at Candlestick Park. Dusty Baker remembers. He is the Giants' manager now, so accustomed to temblors that he doesn't even recall the 5.2-magnitude quake that hit the area last May 14. ''We get a lot of quakes around here,'' Baker said. Baker does remember the 7.1 quake 13 years ago. He was the hitting coach for the Giants, taking a cup of coffee under the stands while waiting for the first pitch, half an hour away. ''Just sort of weird,'' Baker recalled the other day. ''They didn't really shake, they sort of flowed. It looked like Jell-O. You know how Jell-O shakes. You would imagine that the cement almost looked liquid.'' Baker said his immediate reaction was that his daughter ''was doing a book report.'' ''They were having earthquake awareness week at her school,'' he said. ''She told me to get under a desk or something, or stand in a door well. ''I went and stood in the door well, tried not to panic, stopped shaking,'' Baker admitted, recalling how he looked for his family to make sure everybody was all right. Then later you get alarmed or scared,'' he said, ''because you imagine what that would have been like if all that cement had come down on us.'' Magowan, who did not yet own the team in 1989, was among friends, awaiting the first pitch. ''I almost got knocked down,'' he said. ''But my first reaction was that it wasn't so bad. I figured the game would be played that night or the next. But then I saw that the Bay Bridge was down.'' As dingy and miserable as Candlestick was, it had been built in separate sections to avoid the stress that might crumble the entire mass. Sixty-three people were killed in the Bay Area, which made the World Series seem entirely trivial. It took 10 days before baseball felt it had the right to finish its business. Many things have happened since then. This ancient franchise almost moved to Tampa, Fla., in 1993, but the National League elders, in a rare show of wisdom, voted down that shift. Magowan, whose money comes from Safeway, stepped in and bought the club and pledged it would remain in the city where he has lived since his family left New York in the late 50's. He made the most of the windy dump at Candlestick Park and eventually arranged for the financing of a $357 million stadium at the edge of downtown. (He also pays a lease of $1.2 million a year for the use of the land.) There are dozens of neat touches -- a playground for children, signs and photos honoring the Giants' past, eccentric pavilions and stands, and less wind affecting the infield than at Candlestick. And attention was paid to the potential of a giant-sized earthquake. ''You can't build anything in San Francisco without earthquake protection,'' Magowan said, ''but particularly if it is privately financed. You would not want to build another one.'' Fifteen to 18 percent of the cost of the new stadium went to earthquake protection, according to Laurence M. Baer, the chief operating officer for the Giants, who conducted a tour as the Giants worked out on a sunny afternoon. Yesterday was not quite as warm and still as that lazy afternoon in 1989 -- ''earthquake weather,'' according to folk wisdom but a myth according to scientists. The land was stabilized by rock columns and grout, to combat the shifting process that happens on sandy soil in an earthquake. Then 2,400 piles up to 10 feet in length were driven into the reinforced soil. The stadium, built by HOK from Kansas City, Mo., also uses rollers and expansion joints, so the stadium will bend but not break. ''The real story is that this old franchise survived in this old city,'' said Baer, a fourth-generation San Franciscan. For visitors who watched Candlestick Park doing the rumba over our heads in 1989, just surviving an earthquake is a pretty miraculous story, too. Sports of The Times"
"More than a week after an earthquake that killed 26 children in one town, many schools in southern Italy remained closed and some that were open had empty desks because frightened parents had kept their children at home. Meanwhile, public safety officials argued over who or what was to blame for the death toll in the Nov. 1 quake in San Giuliano di Puglia. Politicians pressed for assurances that what happened there would never happen again, as the grieving families of the 26 children who died when their elementary school came crashing down demanded nothing less. ''We don't want the truth to be buried along with the bodies of our children,'' said Nunziatina Porrazzo, whose 7-year-old son was killed. The disaster has prompted an unusual bout of self-examination. Prominent politicians and one of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's television channels have raised money for the victims' families. Yet, while the country mourned, many also demanded answers. Among them was President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who attended the funeral in San Giuliano di Puglia, a town of fewer than 2,000 people. ''When one asks a mother, 'Where is your child?' and she says at school, it's the safest answer and it should be the safest place,'' Mr. Ciampi said. Italians have been asking why the school, built in 1953, collapsed. Blame fell as much on ill-advised renovations and government negligence as on the earthquake itself, which registered a magnitude of 5.4. Accusations mounted after the discovery of a 1998 seismic map that included San Giuliano among areas vulnerable to earthquakes. An earlier official map, drawn in 1981, classified the town as out of harm's way. Officials said the 1998 map never reached the proper authorities because it had bounced from agency to agency before ending up at a meeting early this year of regional leaders, who decided it needed more study. ''The scientists did their work,'' said Enzo Boschi, of the National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology, ''but, in Italy, ministers and governments change all the time and many things get moved around.'' But even Mr. Boschi conceded that the revised map might not have prevented the tragedy in San Giuliano. He said it would not be practical, or even possible, to rebuild all of Italy's structures. ''We have very old, beautiful buildings here, many with frescoes inside,'' he said. ''This isn't California or Japan.'' Most public officials agree, however, that Italy needs tougher building laws to safeguard future schools and homes against earthquakes. Michele Iorio, the governor of Molise, the region that includes San Giuliano, was in Rome on Thursday lobbying for those laws as well as for more emergency aid for his region. ''It makes more sense to say from now on we only build anti-earthquake buildings -- it only costs 15 percent more and it's worth it,'' Mr. Iorio said. ''Today, there is still no obligation for the regions to apply anti-earthquake regulations.'' There are other concerns. Although news reports have focused on the deaths in San Giuliano, more than 10,000 residents in the region are homeless. Hundreds of houses, their walls cracked or crumbled, were deemed uninhabitable. The Molise government estimated the quake's damage at $300 million and pitched tents to house the newly homeless as cold weather set in. In San Giuliano, teachers organized makeshift classrooms under the canvas tents. They wanted the town's children to get back to something like a normal routine."
"More than 50 children were trapped under layers of crumbled concrete -- and at least 20 were killed -- when an earthquake in southern Italy today caused the sudden collapse of a nursery and elementary school here. A huge, somber army of police officers and firefighters worked late into the night to dig out bodies and try to reach survivors, listening for the sound of voices and using everything from gargantuan cranes and plastic buckets to their bare hands. As midnight approached and the grim excavation continued, rescue workers at the scene said that more than half the children had been removed from the rubble, but that others were still buried and that the death toll might rise. The disaster stunned Italy, prompting Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to fly by helicopter to visit the wreckage tonight. It transformed this tiny, tranquil town of olive trees and medieval buildings into a scene of dread and grief. Many residents huddled in small clutches on the sides of the streets, moaning and sobbing. Others stood as close as they could to the devastated school, their eyes focused unblinkingly on the rescue effort. ''Every time we see a child pulled out, we hold our breath,'' said Pippino Barbiero, 52, who waited on a fire escape opposite the school for some sign of the fate of his 10-year-old nephew, a pupil there. ''We go down to see, and then, when it's not him, we come back up here,'' Mr. Barbiero said, referring to himself and another of the boy's uncles, Michele Remmo. ''All we can do is hope.'' ''It's terrible,'' Mr. Remmo said, ''to see a child under there.'' Their nephew, Gianni Nardelli, was among what officials said were 56 children, some as young as 4, some in the midst of a Halloween party, inside the school when an quake with a magnitude of 5.4 hit the Molise region early this afternoon, doing its greatest damage here. Several structures in this agricultural town of about 1,200 residents were toppled, and in addition to the dead schoolchildren, two adult women in nearby homes were killed, law enforcement officials said. While much of the area around the school looked relatively unscathed, the school itself was reduced to dusty debris and flattened to a fraction of its former size. It looked as if something colossal had crashed down upon it. Even hours after they began sifting through the debris, rescue workers seemed transfixed by the sight of it and unable to come to terms with what lay beneath it. One firefighter who stood a few yards from the school, taking a short break, whispered into a cellphone: ''They are children. They are children. They are dead children.'' Ambulances waited along the streets, and endless phalanxes of police officers, their hands linked, formed human chains to keep the streets clear for emergency traffic. At about 9:15 P.M., the rescue workers suddenly accelerated their pace, and minutes later, several of them rushed to a stretcher with a wriggling boy who residents said was 6 or 7. As they laid him on a stretcher and wheeled it to an ambulance, Giuseppe Colombo, the school's principal, who had been pacing up and down the street with a frantic look on his face, reached out his hand and brushed the boy's cheek with it. ''How are you?'' he said. ''How are you? They tell me you're going to be fine.'' Mr. Colombo carried a list of all the children who had been at school that day, so he could keep track of who had been found and who had not. ''These kids are like my children,'' he said, then walked quickly away and resumed his pacing. As more than 500 police officers, firefighters, paramedics and even forest rangers descended on San Giuliano, it came to resemble a military encampment. Flatbed trucks carrying bulldozers and cranes rumbled incongruously down the narrow roads that twist along the steep hills surrounding the town. A gym at the edge of town was transformed into a makeshift morgue, and dozens of police officers milled at the entrance of it, looking at the ground and barely speaking to one another. A man and woman leaving the gym sobbed quietly, holding on to one another for support. It was just one of countless snapshots of grief. Closer to the school, an old man sobbed into his hands, repeating: ''They've got to help him. They've got to help.'' Several feet away, a woman wrapped in a green blanket sipped from a bottle of water that another woman held for her. Her own hands were shaking too violently to hold it. Mr. Berlusconi also visited several hospitals where children and other injured residents were being treated. ''There's nothing to say,'' he told reporters. ''It's a tragedy.'' The earthquake was the strongest to hit Italy since 1997, and it forced the evacuation of many of San Giuliano's residents and left thousands homeless. Some of the children pulled from the wreckage appeared to have only minor injuries, but others were in serious condition, officials said."
"The first couple of earthquakes were, understandably, upsetting. ''I was in a sandwich shop buying lunch and a lady started screaming, 'It's the end of the world as we know it!' '' Marie Corcoran, a complaints analyst at the Cooperative Insurance Society, recalled. ''All the food was sliding toward us.'' That was more than three weeks ago, when the people of Manchester were earthquake naifs, unused to threats from below. By now, after an unusual period in which the normally stable city has been treated to more than 70 mostly minuscule earthquakes, contributing to what geologists are calling a harmless ''swarm,'' the mood has shifted. Fear is no longer a factor. ''Because they're so small, they're almost cute, as far as environmental catastrophes go,'' said Raphael Conn, a filmmaker. ''We've turned them into our pet earthquakes: Liverpool hasn't got them.'' It helps, of course, that the earthquakes are truly tiny, with a magnitude of 2.1 to 3.9, mere taps on the shoulder compared with the recent ones in Italy and elsewhere. Nearly 30 have been felt by the people here and have manifested themselves in ways that tend toward the teacup-rattling and the tile-propelling; the rest have been detected by machines, but not by people. It also helps that geologists have reassured initially jittery residents that no, there is no need to worry about the Big One. Indeed, except for people falling down and slightly hurting themselves, there have been no reports of serious injuries. ''On the basis of what we know, nothing is preparing to happen,'' said Ernest H. Rutter, professor of structural geology at the University of Manchester, who reacted to the first earthquake by peering outside to see if any large trucks were passing by. Professor Rutter said there was no accounting for swarms, which come and go as they please. ''You could have these sorts of earthquakes anywhere at any time,'' he said. A whole swath of mainland Britain, it seems, lies right over a geological section that is prone to what, in geology circles, are known as seismic incidents, and little earthquakes can happen at a rate of about 200 a year. The biggest recent quake, centered under Birmingham, 70 miles away, measured 4.8 and was the strongest felt in Britain in 10 years. What makes the Manchester earthquakes so unusual is their sheer persistence and the fact that they are taking place in the middle of a busy city, not in the middle of nowhere, which is usually the case in Britain. Julian Bukits, an assistant scientific officer at the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh, traveled to Manchester recently to check out the earthquakes. Six took place while he was there, but he was outside at the time and did not feel them. ''It was just bad timing,'' he said. ''They felt them in the building.'' The earthquakes have taken some getting used to. Thousands of people have contacted the geological survey with accounts of where they were, and what they were doing, during the worst ones. The next-door building lost a gargoyle,'' went one e-mail. Another said, ''All the pigeons flew away,'' while still another writer reported, ''I felt shocks up my spine, and I was thrown out of my chair.'' One of the epicenters was in the neighborhood of Beswick, home to the School of the Resurrection, which was on midterm break when the first quakes hit. Barbara Holt, a teacher, heard the news on the radio as she drove to school to do some administrative work. ''I thought, epicenter? This is a bit silly,'' she said. But when Ms. Holt got inside, the building started to vibrate as if someone had given the roof a vigorous shake. She happened to be standing on a chair, reaching for something, at the time. ''I thought, 'Perhaps I will get off the chair,' '' she said. Down the road, the quake was felt by Michael Howarth, 10, and by his hamster, age unknown. ''The hamster was in bed and it woke up and began to run about,'' Michael said. ''I said to my mum, 'What was that?' and she said, 'I don't know.' '' Things were scarier in the center of town, where more than 3,000 people work at the 25-story Cooperative Insurance Society building. During one of the earliest quakes, there was a big rumble, followed by silence and then uneasy chattering in the cafeteria. The next one came right afterward. This time, the only sound was of people stampeding toward the exits. ''We just legged it,'' said Gemma Brocklehurst, 22. But by now panic has turned to sangfroid. Sarah Dursley, 24, was giving a customer insurance advice over the telephone when a later tremor struck. Ms. Dursley inadvertently gasped, only to have the customer shout: ''Are you in that big building? Get out! Get out! Save yourself!'' ''But I just laughed,'' Ms. Dursley said. ''They really don't bother me anymore.''"
"A man lay beside one of the tiny white coffins, his head turned toward it, his eyes never leaving it. Next to several of the other coffins, women in black rocked back and forth, shouting out their grief to everyone and no one. There was a coffin with a sign that read: ''Your wish was to play the organ. Now you can play it for the angels.'' There were coffins topped with Barbie dolls, stuffed animals, a soccer jersey, a soccer ball. And inside the white coffins were the children who died when their elementary school came crashing down, burying them beneath slabs and shards of concrete. The coffins were lined up one after another along the walls of a gymnasium here that became makeshift morgue. That grim tableau today in this remote, small southern Italian town underscored the loss that residents were struggling to comprehend, as the death toll from an earthquake climbed to 29. The three adult victims were a teacher at the school and two elderly women in nearby homes. The others were children. A pained resignation has settled over streets that on Thursday were filled with ambulances, engines idling, back doors open, stretchers at the ready. Seeking the 62 people who had been inside the school when the quake struck, rescue workers managed in the end to pull 35 out alive, according to law enforcement officials at the scene. By this afternoon, most of the ambulances were gone. Almost all the children who were dug out of the rubble today were dead. A growing sense of futility was evident in the sluggish movements of the exhausted rescue workers, who finally took pauses to sit on dust-covered curbs and allow themselves a few minutes for food. ''Every time we take a dead kid out, it's like a defeat,'' one of them said. ''There's no more hope.'' Tonight, after pulling out two bodies that they said were the last, workers finally stopped digging. But public officials around Italy were just beginning to ask questions about whether the disaster could have been prevented, and why the school, built in the 1950's, had been so badly damaged when buildings beside it remained standing. Rescue workers said its construction might not have been solid enough for an earthquake-prone area, adding that renovations in the last two years had perhaps added weight to the original roof. Most residents have not yet begun to think about that. They are still consumed by grief. In a town of about 1,200 people, they said, it is impossible not to have known many if not all of the young victims, and impossible not to feel that an irreplaceable part of the future has vanished. ''It struck the heart of this town,'' said Giuseppe Ciccone, 70, noting that even the mayor, Antonio Borrelli, had two children at the school, one of whom died. Mr. Ciccone said he himself had lost two relatives, boys of 6 and 7. ''Now,'' he said, ''we're left without people for the future.'' Nor was it certain that all of the rescued children would survive. Filippo Vitale, director of a nearby hospital to which many of them were taken, said tonight that five were so severely injured that they were now at special pediatric care centers in Rome and Ancona. Late this afternoon, as workers sought to remove a teacher and a student who they said were the last of the buried victims, San Giuliano was jolted into panic yet again, as two tremors shook the streets within 10 minutes of each other. Residents screamed. Parts of the walls of a few buildings fell suddenly, and an intersection a few hundred feet from the school was consumed by an impenetrable cloud of dust. Firefighters sprinted this way and that, yelling at people to move into open areas. As soon as the dust settled, people who had briefly lost sight of friends or relatives cried out for them, then rushed to them and hugged them fiercely. Although law enforcement officials said that only a handful of people were injured today, they quickly ordered the evacuation of San Giuliano, and red-eyed, quivering residents made their way out in cars and on foot. As they moved into a temporary tent city and started to plan for a mass funeral as early as Sunday, a local priest told several Italian news organizations that there had been a tremor in San Giuliano on Wednesday night and that he had warned town officials not to open the school the next day. Stefan De Mistura, a coordinator for Italian Red Cross workers in San Giuliano, said he might have given the same warning, but added, ''You must realize that there have been tremors before, and nothing happened.'' He and other officials in San Giuliano said they had gleaned details of the disaster from conversations with surviving children. Some had been having a Halloween party. When the building started to collapse, one teacher stayed inside so she could push students out the door. She was the one who died. Rescue workers said that in sifting through the debris, they had constantly come across reminders of the victims' youth. They said they had found the remnants of homework assignments, composition books and erasers, drawings of trees and flowers. ''It's horrible,'' said Vito Tralli, a firefighter whose company had driven four hours, from a town far south, to lend its help. ''There aren't any words for it.''"
"From the Arctic Circle to the Gulf of Mexico, people along a wide swath of the continent today were assessing fallout from one of the largest earthquakes in American history. It appears to have caused little serious damage and only minor injuries. The quake on Sunday afternoon, measuring 7.9 in magnitude and centered on a sparsely populated area about 80 miles south of Fairbanks, shook the ground at least 30 seconds and sent seismic waves that yanked the Trans-Alaska Pipeline from its elevated cradle, apparently caused small earth movements around Yellowstone National Park and rocked boats in Louisiana. Had the quake happened in a major city, scientists said, it would have destroyed hundreds of buildings and killed many people. ''A quake of this magnitude would have leveled a big part of Los Angeles,'' said Dale Grant, a geophysicist with the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo. ''We're still picking up hundreds of aftershocks, and I would expect, when all is said and done, this will be revised upward to an 8 magnitude.'' For now, the temblor ranks ninth among the largest quakes, by magnitude, in United States history. By comparison, the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which destroyed the city, was 7.8 in magnitude, according to the federal earthquake center. Rumbling out of the Alaskan interior, the quake knocked down pieces of the H-shaped struts holding the 800-mile-long Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The pipeline was immediately shut down. After an aerial survey today, pipeline officials said they found no leaks in the structure, which carries 17 percent of American domestic oil from the North Slope to the port of Valdez. But officials with the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, which operates the line, said they were unsure when the pipeline would reopen. The supports are designed to sway with earth movement. But this quake was so strong it knocked some of the crossbars off, leaving sections of the pipeline suspended. Alyeska officials put up timber frames today as a temporary solution. ''We don't anticipate a long-term shutdown,'' said Mike Heatwole, a spokesman for Alyeska. But inventories are low in Valdez, where the pipeline's oil is loaded onto ships, meaning a long shutdown could disrupt the flow of oil to the lower 48 states. The pipeline crosses the Denali Fault, where two crustal slabs slipped past each other on Sunday, setting off the quake. It was the second major earth movement in the area in two weeks. On Oct. 23, a 6.7 magnitude quake rocked an area around Denali National Park. Scientists speculate that the two quakes are related and thus should relieve stress along the fault. The worst reports of damage were on stretches of the Tok Cutoff, a major road that connects the Alaska Highway with roads to Anchorage. In the town of Tok, residents ran outside as the ground slipped away, groceries fell from shelves and glasses shattered. Even for quake-hardy residents of Alaska, the nation's most seismically active state, Sunday's temblor rattled many nerves. ''It was so strong you couldn't walk,'' said Jeanne Morris, who works at Fast Eddy's Restaurant in Tok. ''Four of us got under one doorway, because that's what they tell you to do, but we couldn't stand up.'' Ms. Morris said chandeliers swayed and rattled in the restaurant but the building was otherwise unscathed. She marveled that her three-story log house, which she said was not built to code, was not damaged. ''Some of my wine bottles came out, but they didn't break,'' said Ms. Morris. The quake opened cracks four feet wide and eight feet deep in parts, according to Alaska State Troopers. More than 1,400 miles to the south, seismic waves shook Seattle's houseboat community at Lake Union, causing walkways to ripple, sewage pipes to snap and waterlines to crack. Scientists say the quake was the apparent cause of scores of earthquakes in Yellowstone National Park on Sunday and today. More than 200 small quakes have been detected in the last 24 hours, officials said. The triggering effect, even 2,000 miles from the epicenter of the original quake, ''confirms what we are beginning to see worldwide -- that earthquakes can be triggered by other earthquakes at great distances,'' said Robert B. Smith, a University of Utah professor of geology and geophysics. In Louisiana, nearly 3,000 miles from the quake, there were numerous reports of waves and boats moving up and down, federal earthquake officials said. But the one sizable city closest to the quake, Fairbanks, reported little significant damage. The nation's worse earthquake ever, the 9.2-magnitude earthquake near Anchorage in 1964, killed 131 people and prompted rebuilding throughout the state, with new structures designed to move with earthquakes. Three of the largest 10 earthquakes in world history, and 7 of the 10 biggest American quakes, occurred in Alaska. ''For Alaska, this is basically a normal occurrence,'' said Mr. Grant, of the federal earthquake center. He said the seismic energy from Sunday's temblor traveled far because the quake was so shallow, about three miles below the surface of the earth. Some quakes are 10 times as deep. When the quake is shallow, it can cause a ripple of energy that runs a long way."
"Now that New Yorkers have faced and conquered fear, seismologists are ready to talk. The next disaster, they want you to know, may not be a terrorist attack, but an old-fashioned earthquake. The last big one had its epicenter off Coney Island on Aug. 10, 1884. Estimated at 5.2 on the Richter scale, it toppled hundreds of chimneys in the city. An equivalent tremor off Coney Island today could cause $750 million in damage in Manhattan alone. Geologists place the probability of such a quake at once every 100 years, which means it is nearly 20 years overdue. ''There's no reason to think that kind of an earthquake can't happen again,'' said Robert H. Fakundiny, a geologist and chief of the New York State Geological Survey. ''There was a 10-year period where thing were pretty quiet,'' he said, ''but we're seeing more earthquake activity now.'' Last month a moderately powerful earthquake, registering 5.3, rumbled across the city. But by the time it arrived from its epicenter near Plattsburgh, N.Y., it had only the force of a passing subway. Tremors originating in the city are rare, but they happen; in fact, twice in the past 16 months. Minor earthquakes, measuring about 2.5 in magnitude, were detected under Upper Manhattan in 2001. The first, on Jan. 17, occurred around 82nd Street and Second Avenue; the second, on Oct. 27, was in the vicinity of 95th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. Little damage was inflicted, but the events worried scientists. ''This was the first time that we have recorded and seen earthquakes in Manhattan,'' said Won-Young Kim, a seismologist with the Columbia University Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y. ''The faults are active.'' Three such faults, which are fractures in the earth's crust where earthquakes can begin, were identified in the late 80's in a survey for the city's third water tunnel. One, the 125th Street Fault, runs from New Jersey to the East River, skirting the northern tip of Central Park and running southeast to Roosevelt Island. The Dyckman Street Fault traverses the Inwood section of Manhattan and extends into the Bronx. The Mosholu Parkway Fault is farther north, and runs roughly parallel to the others. ''There could be others we don't know about,'' including suspected ones beneath 23rd and 14th Streets, said Alexander E. Gates, chairman of the earth sciences department at Rutgers University. While West Coast earthquakes are stronger and more frequent than those in the East, New York is vulnerable because of its density and older building stock. Taking into account both the likelihood of a quake and the damage it could cause, ''New York City ranks fourth in earthquake risk after Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle,'' said Nano Seeber, a senior research associate at Lamont. Seismologists have known of the dangers for some time, but vigilance has come slowly. Until last year, no seismographs monitored the city's fault lines. Only in 1995, after years of lobbying, was the city's building code amended to require lateral bracing for new buildings and mandate gaps between structures to prevent a domino effect. (Most high-rises are not considered at risk because they were built to withstand strong winds.) ''New Yorkers didn't underestimate earthquakes,'' said Klaus Jacob, a seismologist who was a member of the Department of Building's Seismic Committee. ''They ignored them.'' DENNY LEE NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK UP CLOSE"
"Aid workers set up shelters today for the thousands of people left homeless in an earthquake on Saturday in northwestern Iran, as officials lowered the estimate of the death toll to about 220 from more than 500. However, some witnesses said that number represented the number of bodies found and buried, but that many more people were still missing. The 6.0-magnitude quake, which was followed by more than 20 aftershocks, destroyed 5,000 houses and left 25,000 families homeless, officials said. Ten villages were obliterated, and more than 60 villages were mostly destroyed. Many of the victims were women and children who were still home at 7:30 a.m., when the earthquake occurred. Iran's interior minister, Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari, visited the affected areas today and said the reconstruction of damaged areas will begin within a week. In the past half century, 11 earthquakes have killed nearly 100,000 people in Iran. Most houses in villages are made of mud brick and are unable to withstand strong earthquakes. The United States, despite a lack of diplomatic relations with Iran, is among the countries that have offered assistance. On Saturday, President Bush offered condolences."
"Slip 'n' Slide Glaciers Whoever invented the Slip 'n' Slide knew a thing or two about friction -- namely that a child in a bathing suit will not get very far gliding on a 20-foot-long piece of plastic in the backyard unless there is a stream of water on it to provide lubrication. Glaciers and ice sheets do a lot of slipping and sliding as well, and here too, water plays an important role. Just how important is made clear by research from scientists at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and several other institutions. The researchers measured movement of a part of the ice sheet that covers most of Greenland, using Global Positioning System readings of the displacement of a pole stuck in the ice. They found that the movement accelerated significantly in summer, when a lot of surface ice melted. For example, the researchers found that in the summers of 1998 and 1999, the rate of movement increased by three to three-and-a-half inches per day above the average midwinter rate of 12 inches per day. In the low-melt summer of 1996, however, the rate increased by less than half an inch per day. The results, the researchers write in the journal Science, show that glacial sliding can be affected by the quick movement of water from the surface of the ice sheet to its bottom, probably through crevasses and vertical channels called moulins. Once it reaches the bottom (having traveled about 4,000 feet in the case of the Greenland sheet), the water provides lubrication between the ice and bedrock. Previously it had been thought that surface melting would affect movement only slowly, over hundreds of years, as ice thickness changed and altered the stresses at the bottom that help drive the sheet along. The researchers say their work suggests that the effect is much more rapid, and that ice movement could be rapidly increased by climate warming. Shaking Under Japan There is plenty of slipping and sliding going on under Japan, too -- the occasional earthquake, of course, but also much less powerful (and more constant) vibrations from deep underground. Many of these vibrations are caused by volcanoes, of which Japan has more than its share. But Japanese scientists recently discovered another, nonvolcanic, rumbling from the deep. And once again, water plays a role. The tremors were picked up by an array of 600 highly sensitive seismic stations set up by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention as a kind of early warning system for earthquakes. The tremors are very weak, and could be picked up only by such an extensive and sensitive array. Researchers from the institute were able to locate the source of the tremors at a depth of about 25 miles under southwestern Japan, where the Philippine Sea plate is sinking beneath the Eurasian plate, a process known as subduction. Writing in Science, the researchers suggest that the tremors occur as the subducting slab of rock dries out. As the plate sinks, pressure and friction cause it to heat up, and lots of water is liberated from the minerals that make up the rock. This superheated water, in turn, can cause many small fractures in the rock, resulting in the tremors. Sauropod Solidarity British scientists have analyzed dinosaur footprints from a limestone quarry near Oxford and have discovered evidence that different species herded together, perhaps to avoid predators. In a report in Science, the scientists say that 40 close-together trackways -- trails of 163-million-year-old footprints -- are a sign that more than one species of plant-eating sauropod dinosaur may have traveled together to avoid meat-eating predators. The analysis is bolstered by the presence, not too far away, of the tracks of a carnivore who was heading in the same direction at about the same time. Observatory"
"A powerful earthquake hit northwestern Iran this morning, killing at least 500 people and injuring more than 1,000. The earthquake, which had a preliminary magnitude of 6.0, was centered near the towns of Abgarm and Avaj, in the Qazvin region, south of the Elburz mountain range. It hit at 7:28 a.m. and caused serious damage in 94 villages in eight provinces, officials said. Six of the villages were destroyed, and 200 bodies of victims had been retrieved from those areas by early afternoon, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. It said the quake had destroyed 5,000 homes, leaving 25,000 people homeless. ''The number of injured people is very high,'' Majid Shalviri, the director of the Red Crescent Society, a relief organization that provides disaster relief, said in Qazvin. ''Exact figures are still not available, but there will be many casualties.'' State television showed one- and two-story buildings that had been turned into piles of debris, littered with metal doors and torn mattresses. Many residents began digging into the rubble with shovels and bare hands, seeking survivors and pulling out bodies, even before aid workers reached the areas, one witness said. Areas with mud-brick houses, which are especially vulnerable to damage from earthquakes, were completely ruined, a witness said. In one area, the witness said, no buildings remained standing, and the mud and rubble made it impossible for aid helicopters to land. The news agency also reported that the roofs of two 11th-century towers, left from the days when the Seljuk Turks ruled Iran, had collapsed. Until late afternoon, survivors in most areas were left with no shelter and no food. Air and ground relief forces were sent to the affected areas with helicopters and ambulances, but the scale of the damage was so large that it made it hard to distribute aid, officials said. State television called on people to donate blankets, canned food and tents, especially for survivors in areas that were cold at night. Eighteen aftershocks hit the area later today, of which three were powerful enough to cause further destruction and casualties. Officials warned the residents that there could be more aftershocks for as long as three weeks. ''People should not get close to the damaged buildings that are still standing, because the aftershocks can knock them down over their heads and cause more casualties,'' Nasrollah Kamalian, the director of the geophysics institute in Tehran, was quoted as saying by the Iranian Students' News Agency. Iran is situated on several fault lines, and earthquakes are common. The last major earthquake hit western Iran in 1997, killing 1,560 people. In 1990, 37,000 people were killed in an earthquake in Gilan Province."
"IT not only can happen here, it has happened here. New Yorkers who imagine themselves insulated from the threat of earthquakes received a gently rumbling reminder to the contrary two months ago. Early in the morning of Saturday, April 20, a moderately powerful earthquake 15 miles southwest of Plattsburgh, N.Y., sent tremors as far south as Brooklyn -- where it felt like a passing subway train -- and beyond. Though it left the city undamaged, it underscored that New York is not immune from seismic activity. Indeed, minor earthquakes in January 2001 and October 2001 were centered in Manhattan itself. Earthquake consciousness is growing in New York. Under the banner of the New York City Area Consortium for Earthquake Loss Mitigation, engineers and scientists are studying building and soil conditions in an effort to pinpoint where the greatest risks may lie and ultimately to plan the seismic retrofitting of vitally needed structures like firehouses and hospitals. New York City's six-year-old seismic code already dictates how structural elements are connected in new buildings, facades are held in place, masonry is reinforced and utility lines are run and how far buildings are spaced from one another. It requires seismic retrofitting of buildings under substantial renovation and has added to construction costs (though it may one day prove to save reconstruction costs). After Sept. 11, the question is whether any lessons from earthquake-resistant design apply to what seems like the far more pressing threat of terrorism. ''Absolutely,'' said Patricia J. Lancaster, an architect who is the new commissioner of the New York City Buildings Department. ''The redundancy and resilience that come from withstanding lateral forces due to an earthquake would also seem to be able to withstand the lateral forces associated with a bomb.'' Had the 1970's Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City been constructed using current seismic design details, up to 80 percent of the structural damage in the 1995 bombing could have been prevented, Dr. W. Gene Corley, an engineer, told a House subcommittee four years ago. He testified on behalf of the American Society of Civil Engineers. Dr. Michel Bruneau, deputy director of the Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research, based at the State University of New York at Buffalo, believes that some techniques developed over the past 20 years to make structures seismically safe may also be used to make them more resistant to terrorist attacks. A conference on this topic, sponsored by the center, drew about 100 engineers last week to the CUNY Graduate Center in mid-Manhattan. Specifically, Dr. Bruneau referred to dampers that absorb and reduce damaging vibrations and to structures in which surviving columns take up the additional load if other columns are lost or damaged. ''We witnessed the effects of a very large-scale attack on Sept. 11,'' he said. ''But what's more likely to happen in the future is the explosion of a car bomb parked near a building or a bridge. Such an explosion pushes structural elements to their load-bearing limits, to the point where they fail. This is very similar to what happens in an earthquake.'' The goal is not that structures ride out a trauma unscathed but that they remain standing, even in a damaged state, and allow people inside to get out safely. Ductility and redundancy are the watchwords; buildings that bend but do not break, with enough structural elements that no one failure causes a catastrophic collapse. ''What we have to do is make sure there are no singular weak links in the chain,'' said Guy J. P. Nordenson of Guy Nordenson & Associates, a structural engineer and a leading advocate of the seismic code, Local Law 17 of 1995. He said the law may help improve buildings' resistance to attack by requiring that all masonry walls be reinforced, that facade elements be securely anchored and that connections between beams and columns be ductile. That said, however, there are critical differences between earthquakes and explosions, beginning with the force itself, which is almost entirely lateral in one case and spherical in the other. The forces are exerted in different ways across buildings (more uniformly in an earthquake, more locally in the case of a blast) and over different periods of time (minutes in one case, seconds in the other). There is another important difference. Ask an engineer how safe a building is and the engineer is likely to ask under what circumstance. ''When we speak about earthquakes, one can actually calculate a certain probability,'' said Franz-Josef Ulm, associate professor of engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''We have no mathematical tools to evaluate the probability of a terrorist event.'' Rather than trying to anticipate every possible assault on structural integrity, some engineers favor a multihazard approach. ''You don't try to pick only one threat and design for it,'' said Thomas Z. Scarangello, a managing principal of Thornton-Tomasetti Engineers. ''If you design a building in a way that it can resist a variety of potential threats -- environmental, wind, earthquake and blast -- it will perform better under all these cases.'' Or as Mr. Nordenson put it, ''You do think about every eventuality you can, knowing that you will never think of the thing that will happen.'' While an earthquake cannot be predicted, however, computer modeling can be used to describe its likely effects. That is what Mr. Nordenson is working on with Michael W. Tantala, a doctoral candidate in civil engineering at Princeton University, and Prof. George Deodatis of the civil engineering and engineering mechanics department at Columbia University. In the third year of their project, which has been coordinated by the multidisciplinary center, they have projected the effects of earthquakes on 36,935 buildings in Manhattan, neighborhood by neighborhood. They are now preparing a similar analysis of the other boroughs, a total of 750,000 buildings, and the metropolitan region. Their basic tool is an earthquake loss estimation software program known as Hazus, developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Default information is modified to reflect local building types (unreinforced masonry structures are the most vulnerable) and soil conditions (softer soils tend to amplify ground motion). The researchers studied a variety of possibilities, some involving hypothetical earthquakes in a range of magnitudes at a specific location, others based on the probability of a certain ground motion occurring within a specified period of time. The findings -- shown graphically on Page 1 -- assume an earthquake of 6.0 on the moment magnitude scale, somewhat similar to the Richter scale but based on the amount of energy released rather than on instrumental recordings. This hypothetical quake is centered near Rockaway Beach, Queens, the location of the strongest earthquake recorded within the modern boundardies of New York City, on Aug. 10, 1884. In such an event, more than 1,000 buildings, almost 3 percent of the total, would be extensively or completely destroyed in Manhattan, the researchers found, most in the area south of 14th Street. Not coincidentally, the highest concentration of unreinforced masonry buildings is in Greenwich Village, Chinatown, Little Italy, SoHo and NoHo. More than 22,000 buildings would escape undamaged, according to this projection. Depending on the time of day, the researchers estimated that between 130 and 250 people would be killed or injured seriously enough to require hospitalization. The researchers looked closely at hospitals, firehouses, police stations and schools. They concluded that on the first day of the 6.0-magnitude earthquake, the firefighting service would be taxed to more than five times its capacity, facing more than 100 blazes, with damaged firehouses and interruptions in power and water. The functioning ability of all the vital services would increase markedly as the days passed. Such analysis is not meant as a scare tactic but might help the Fire Department identify which of its unreinforced firehouses it ought to retrofit first. ''That's why this is a planning tool,'' Mr. Nordenson said. Though useful illustratively, the 6.0-magnitude earthquake is one of the unlikeliest events studied by the researchers, with a probability that can be expressed as once in 19,500 years. That is not a short time, Mr. Tantala allowed, though he added, ''That time could be up tomorrow.'' New York has never experienced an earthquake on this scale. The Upper East Side quake on Jan. 17 last year (magnitude 2.4) and the Upper West Side quake on Oct. 27 (magnitude 2.6) were too small to do any damage, said Klaus H. Jacob, senior research scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University. Based on contemporary damage accounts, the 1884 earthquake was retroactively assigned an estimated magnitude of 4.9. ''Although New York City is a region with low seismic hazard (infrequent damaging earthquakes),'' the study says, ''it actually has high seismic risk, which results from concentrations of buildings and infrastructure built according to no seismic codes.'' That is beginning to change as new structures are built under the seismic code, which took effect in 1996. Commissioner Lancaster declined to estimate how many buildings are now in compliance. CONTRARY to one's intuitive sense that an earthquake code would dictate skyscraper design, it is actually far more influential in the design of lower-rise buildings. That is because tall towers are already designed to withstand the force of extremely strong winds and therefore exceed the engineering requirements for a less active seismic zone like New York. Significantly, the law applies to alterations that enlarge the area of an existing building and require new or reinforced foundations. For an enlargement that does not require foundation work, the law applies if the addition costs more than 60 percent of the value of the existing building. ''The biggest impact of the seismic code is in retrofitting older, heavier masonry buildings,'' said Edward M. DePaola of Severud Associates, who is the president of the Structural Engineers Association of New York. It has even affected the reconstruction of a 19th-century stone cottage from County Mayo, Ireland, as part of the Irish Hunger Memorial at Battery Park City, which is to be dedicated next month. Rather than its original rubble-stone core, the cottage had to be rebuilt with concrete behind its fieldstone facade, which is unchanged. At the Jamaica Health Center, Jamaica Avenue and Parsons Boulevard, compliance was triggered by the planned addition of a third-floor tuberculosis clinic atop a 52-year-old, two-story building. That will require V-shaped bracing along three walls of the existing structure. ''On both sides of this two- , soon to be three-story building, you have structures that are not designed for earthquake resistance,'' said an architect formerly associated with the project, who asked that his name not be used. He questioned the need for the extra seismic reinforcement. ''In concept, it seemed to be an illogical procedure to follow,'' he said. But Ms. Lancaster said that, building by building, ''you have to at least be on the road to full compliance.'' And in some cases, she said, the benefit of seismic retrofits is that smaller buildings would not pound into their taller neighbors during an earthquake. In a seismic collision, a taller building is at greater risk from a shorter one, said Carlos M. Dobryn, president of DeSimone Consulting Engineers. To prevent pounding, the seismic code calls for a separation between buildings of one inch for every 50 feet of tower height. That affected the engineering of an addition to the 29-story Bush Building, 130 West 42nd Street, by DeSimone. The addition will be six inches distant. Spanning that gap on each floor will be what amounts to a very short pedestrian bridge: a covered plate attached to the new tower and resting on a cushion in the older building. ''When the buildings move, that plate is free to slide,'' Mr. Dobryn said. Costas Kondylis, one of the more prolific architects in New York City, said the requirements of the seismic code had added to construction costs and subtly affected apartment layouts, by slightly increasing the thickness of walls and columns. But he added, ''By now, we're all used to it.'' It took seven years for the code to be enacted from the time in 1988 that Buildings Commissioner Charles M. Smith Jr. appointed a committee at the urging of engineers and scientists who had concluded that New York was at higher risk for earthquakes than had previously been estimated. Three months ago, the Buildings Department convened its World Trade Center building code task force. Within a year, it is expected to recommend measures ''to increase public safety in and around buildings during extreme events and conditions.'' One change championed by Mr. Nordenson is peer review of large-scale structural engineering plans, rather than the existing self-certification system in which engineers vouch for their own work. Commissioner Lancaster said that the idea seemed good on the face of it and was under consideration but that there were questions as to how the agency could fairly and economically distribute applications for review. The current task force confronts a different challenge than that faced by drafters of the seismic code, among them Richard L. Tomasetti, president of the Thornton-Tomasetti Group. ''We learned from looking at every seismic event what the threats were,'' he said. ''We don't really have a track record here. We don't know. What is the threat we're designing for?'' Mr. Tomasetti suggested there might be resistance to the codification of detailed blast-resistance measures, which could then be easily consulted by terrorists. ''We have numerous private clients who are hardening their buildings that don't want that known,'' he said. ''Not to be facetious but: 'Hey, read the book. You've got to knock out three columns. Two won't do it any more.' '' Ultimately, some engineers wonder just how much of an engineering solution there can be to terrorism. ''Let's not be trying to design buildings for aircraft impact and huge explosions,'' Mr. DePaola said. ''Let's keep the threat away from the building.''"
"A low-intensity earthquake shook the desert floor early yesterday near Yucca Mountain in Nevada, where the government plans to install the nation's first long-term repository for high-level radioactive waste. The authorities reported no damage or injuries. The epicenter of the earthquake was about 15 miles east of the proposed site, which has been the subject of a long dispute between the Bush administration and Nevada officials about the wisdom of placing nuclear waste there. Scientists at the United States Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., said the quake had a magnitude of 4.4. A statement released by the Department of Energy, which is behind the proposed dump site, said pointedly that the quake was not at Yucca Mountain but at Little Skull Mountain, in a ''known and studied'' geologic zone. ''There was no damage to any Yucca Mountain project facilities, structures or the underground Exploratory Studies Facilities,'' the statement said. The proposed repository is designed to withstand an earthquake with 1,000 times more energy than the one reported yesterday, the statement said. But Judy Treichel, executive director of the Nevada Nuclear Waste Task Force, which opposes use of the Yucca Mountain site for radioactive waste, said in an interview that the area had endured 620 earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 or higher over the last 20 years within a radius of 50 miles, and that there was no way of predicting a catastrophic one that might destroy the proposed repository. ''If any sane person or country was going to be looking for a place to store nuclear waste, you could hardly find a worse place than this,'' said Ms. Treichel, whose organization has been based in Las Vegas for 17 years. ''This is just a stupid decision by Congress to go to a state where they thought the population either wouldn't care or wouldn't oppose it.'' On Feb. 14, Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham told President Bush that more than 20 years of scientific study, at a cost of $4 billion, had demonstrated Yucca Mountain's suitability as a place to store the nation's spent industrial, commercial and military nuclear waste. The next day, Mr. Bush announced his choice of the site, about 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas. Storage of the waste, which could remain radioactive for more than 10,000 years, would begin in 2010 about 1,000 feet below ground. Nevada officials have other plans. Last month, Gov. Kenny Guinn exercised his option under the law to veto the president's selection, although Congress has until July 26 to override the governor's action."
"The ground started shaking last Sunday morning beneath this bedroom community about 35 miles east of San Francisco, but there was little concern. The quake measured 3.9 on the Richter scale, and left barely a picture on the wall askew. People in California tend to save their worry for the Big One -- something catastrophic, like the quake that destroyed much of San Francisco in 1906. But when another small quake struck here Sunday night, and another Monday morning, and another and another and another -- by Friday, the United States Geological Survey had registered what it called a ''swarm'' of more than 120 quakes -- nervousness set in. ''Earthquakes are primal-fear things,'' said Stephanie J. Hanna, the Geological Survey's communications chief for the Western region. ''They don't kill as many people as you think, but when terra firma isn't anymore, it scares people down to the deepest level.'' Technically, the San Ramon earthquakes are regarded as ''background seismicity'' because they did not occur on a main fault. But San Ramon is not far from the Calaveras fault, one of three major faults in the San Francisco Bay Area that scientists consider most likely to produce a big earthquake. More significantly, the San Ramon quakes have happened on a small, previously unknown fault that crosses the Calaveras seven miles beneath the surface, potentially triggering quakes on the Calaveras, too. ''I grew up in San Ramon, and normally you have an earthquake and it passes,'' said Parshaw Vaziri, the outreach director at the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center in Berkeley. ''To have it be repetitive for so many days has people thinking. There is a fear that this is leading to something bigger.'' Seismologists say swarms like San Ramon's are not uncommon, but when they strike in heavily populated places known for seismic volatility, they can create unusual anxiety. The last significant swarm near San Ramon occurred several miles to the north in Alamo, Calif., in 1990, when there were 350 quakes over six weeks. In nearby Danville in 1970, there were 353 quakes in a month. David P. Schwartz, chief of the Geological Survey's San Francisco Bay Area Earthquake Hazards Project, said the previous swarms did not set off any major earthquakes. But he and other earthquake experts do not know whether this swarm will be harmless. A study in 1999 by scientists at the United States Geological Survey and elsewhere concluded that there was a 70 percent probability of at least one quake of magnitude 6.7 or greater in the Bay Area before 2030. The Calaveras was among the faults with the highest probability. ''The reason we have concern is that we have seen other places where earthquakes on one fault trigger earthquakes on another fault,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''Our experience with this is just very short. More likely than not, the swarm will dissipate and we will have the San Ramon swarm to talk about. But we are just trying to be a little cautious, and fundamentally watch the sequence develop and watch for any changes.'' He said the last big quake on the Calaveras fault was more than 300 years ago, making it ripe for activity. The section near San Ramon has been quiet for 40 years, he said. ''Whenever you have a section of a fault that has been quiet, and suddenly you have activity on or near it, that raises a flag: What does this mean?'' Mr. Schwartz said. The San Ramon shaking has been minor: no loss of life, no injuries and no reports of property damage, according to the Police Department. Donna Dickey, a city councilwoman, said that most of the quakes had been so small she could not tell if the shaking was from the ground, her grandchildren or the family dogs. But she said the amount of shaking was less relevant than its source: a previously unknown fault beneath a city that had nearly doubled in population in two decades. As San Francisco's suburbs spread east, the thousands of unknown faults that scientists suspect exist in the Bay Area carry potentially greater consequences for life and property. For all the attention on the swarm in San Ramon, Mr. Schwartz said that a recent earthquake in Alaska also carried great significance for Californians. On Nov. 3, a magnitude 7.9 quake, centered about 90 miles south of Fairbanks, damaged supports on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and cracked highways and roads. That quake offered a preview of what seismologists expect on the San Andreas fault in Southern California, he said. A recent report released by the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America said the southern section of that fault ''is primed for an earthquake'' of magnitude 7.6 to 7.8. ''The kind of ground rupture we saw in Alaska, about 200 miles, is the kind of ground rupture that could occur on the southern San Andreas, the part that runs past Palm Springs to San Bernardino,'' he said. ''Had that earthquake occurred in Southern California, we would still be picking up the pieces.''"
"An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.3 rocked the western province of Kermanshah in Iran on Tuesday night, destroying 3,000 houses and injuring 15 people, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported today. A stronger earthquake hit the area in April, killing two people. Today, Iranian television showed frightened villagers who had spent the night out around fires in freezing cold, fearful that aftershocks might claim more casualties. Two milder aftershocks rocked the area."
"After the Quake Stories. By Haruki Murakami. Translated by Jay Rubin. 181 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $21. Haruki Murakami's surreal, metaphysical detective novel, ''The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle'' (1997), was a sort of test of his readers' allegiance: when a character spends 50 pages just sitting at the bottom of a well and trying to clear his head, you're either in or you're out. The novel turned out to be the author's most transfixing work, its prose as plain-spoken as ever but its appetites surprisingly epic and dark, particularly for a book about a guy trying to find his cat. Murakami has released three slim novels here in the last few years, if you count the long-delayed American publication of 1987's ''Norwegian Wood.'' All of them were moving in their way. None were entirely nourishing. Given the scope of ''The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle,'' the minor-key love stories felt like subplots that had sneaked out of town under cover of darkness and were trying to make a go of it alone. Murakami's new book, ''After the Quake,'' is unexpectedly powerful, a collection of stories, slender and small as a hand, about the emotional aftershocks of the 1995 earthquake in Kobe. Murakami has said that he considers himself a novelist above and beyond all else, telling his translator and biographer, Jay Rubin, ''I think it's important to write short stories, and I enjoy doing so, but I believe strongly that if you take away my novels, there is no me.'' Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain. Even if ''After the Quake'' had nothing to say about Murakami, which it certainly does, I'd gladly settle for what it says about us. Kobe lies in western Japan, a considerable distance from the country's twitchiest fault lines, and was always thought to be fairly safe as far as earthquakes were concerned. But at 5:46 on a Tuesday morning in January, a quake struck nonetheless, causing tens of thousands of old blue and brown tile roofs to fall in, killing more than 4,000 people and leaving nearly 300,000 homeless, including Murakami's parents. It took 20 seconds. I'm laying all this out, like a sixth grader's oral report, because it will be hard for Americans to read ''After the Quake'' without taking the earthquake as a metaphor for the attack on the World Trade Center. It's worth remembering that Murakami wrote these stories before Sept. 11, and that he wrote them not because he'd gotten his hands on a nifty literary device but because his homeland had taken a traumatizing shock to the system. The six stories in ''After the Quake'' are all set in February 1995, a month after the earthquake and a month before cult members carried out a sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subway. Which is to say that Murakami has chosen to freeze in time the moment when Japan was staggering away from the scene of one tragedy and, unknowingly, toward another. (The twin disasters moved the author himself to return to Japan after years of self-imposed exile in the United States and write the nonfiction book ''Underground.'' Rubin investigates the intersection of the author's life and art in a lively and eccentric new critical study called ''Haruki Murakami and the Music of Words.'') The characters in ''After the Quake'' all live at a safe remove from Kobe, but the shock waves reach them daily via the newspaper and television. The opening story, ''U.F.O. in Kushiro,'' concerns Komura, a stereo salesman and a familiar Murakami hero in the sense that he's so straightforward, so decent -- ultimately so plain -- that weirdness seems drawn to him like a storm looking for a low-pressure area. For five days, Komura's wife watches earthquake reports around the clock, barely eating, never speaking. On the sixth day, she walks out on him, leaving a note that reads: ''The problem is that you never give me anything. Or, to put it more precisely, you have nothing inside that you can give me. You are good and kind and handsome, but living with you is like living with a chunk of air.'' What happens next is a classic bit of deadpan Murakami strangeness: Komura agrees to deliver a box for a friend and only after he's passed it along does he think to wonder what was inside. In the end, the mystery drives him close to violence. The box, presumably, is a symbol for Komura himself. Either it contains his soul, and he's just handed it to a stranger -- or it's been empty all along. Murakami has always been drawn to characters who feel empty inside -- if you take away my novels, there is no me -- and the earthquake has only heightened their sense of dislocation. ''Landscape With Flatiron'' is a melancholy story about a young woman and a middle-aged painter who apparently abandoned his wife and children in Kobe. The pair make hypnotic bonfires on a beach, form a bond and trade fears until, one night, the artist says: ''I don't know. We could die together. What do you say?'' ''Super-Frog Saves Tokyo'' is a wild story about a six-foot-tall frog who appears in the home of an ordinary bank officer named Mr. Katagiri. The frog tells Katagiri that he needs his aid in the battle against an enormous worm that lives beneath Tokyo and is planning to unleash a crippling earthquake. ''Super-Frog'' is such an engaging mix of realism and fantasy (''I am a genuine frog. Shall I croak for you?'') that it takes a while for you to realize what a sad undertow the story has and how much it says about Katagiri's solitary life, his feelings of powerlessness and his dread of another quake. I mean, unless there really was a six-foot frog. With Murakami, you never know. The final story in ''After the Quake,'' ''Honey Pie,'' comes closest to spelling out Murakami's message, which, with apologies to Rilke, is something along the lines of: you must change your life, if you can even call it a life. An agonizingly passive writer named Junpei gets a second chance to marry a woman he's never once stopped thinking about. Astonishingly, he equivocates. Then the earthquake hits: ''He hadn't set foot on those streets since his graduation, but still, the sight of the destruction laid bare raw wounds hidden somewhere deep inside him. . . . Junpei felt an entirely new sense of isolation. I have no roots, he thought. I'm not connected to anything.'' Junpei's attempt to seize the day -- and the woman -- is fraught and painful and enormously affecting. Yes, Murakami wrote these stories before Sept. 11. Still, he must know how ''After the Quake'' will resonate in the United States. The collection was published in Japan as ''All God's Children Can Dance,'' but he changed the title for the English translation. One sliver of what makes the book so moving is the sense that on some level it is Murakami's deeply felt get-well card. Jeff Giles is a senior editor at Newsweek, where he writes about books, movies and music."
"Nearly 70 years ago, a Soviet geochemist, reflecting on his world, made a startling observation: through technology and sheer numbers, he wrote, people were becoming a geological force, shaping the planet's future just as rivers and earthquakes had shaped its past. Eventually, wrote the scientist, Vladimir I. Vernadsky, global society, guided by science, would soften the human environmental impact, and earth would become a ''noosphere,'' a planet of the mind, ''life's domain ruled by reason.'' Today, a broad range of scientists say, part of Vernadsky's thinking has already been proved right: people have significantly altered the atmosphere and are the dominant influence on ecosystems and natural selection. The question now, scientists say, is whether the rest of his vision will come to pass. Choices made in the next few years will determine the answer. Aided by satellites and supercomputers, and mobilized by the evident environmental damage of the last century, humans have a real chance to begin balancing economic development with sustaining earth's ecological webs, said Dr. William C. Clark, a biologist at Harvard who heads an international effort to build a scientific foundation for such a shift. ''We've come through a period of finally understanding the nature and magnitude of humanity's transformation of the earth,'' Dr. Clark said. ''Having realized it, can we become clever enough at a big enough scale to be able to maintain the rates of progress? I think we can.'' Some scientists say it is anthropocentric hubris to think people understand the living planet well enough to know how to manage it. But that prospect is attracting more than 100 world leaders and thousands of other participants to the United Nations' World Summit on Sustainable Development, which starts on Monday in Johannesburg. No matter what they come up with, ice ages, volcanoes and shifting tectonic plates will dwarf human activities in the long run. But communities and countries face concrete choices in the next decade that are likely to determine the quality of human life and the environment well into the 22nd century. Human activity is such a pervasive influence on the planet's ecological framework that it is no longer possible to separate people and nature. Emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, whether from an Ohio power plant or a Bangkok taxicab, contribute to global warming. Seafood lovers dining in Manhattan bistros prompt fishing vessels to sweep Antarctic waters for slow-growing Chilean sea bass. Shoppers in Tokyo seeking inexpensive picture frames send loggers deep into Indonesian forests. In a new book ''Great Transition: The Promise and Lure of the Times Ahead,'' published by the Stockholm Environment Institute, a group of top geographers, economists, engineers and other experts concludes that the same inventiveness that accelerated the human ascent can be harnessed to soften human impact. The need for a new approach is urgent, the researchers say, because a surge of growth in quickly industrializing regions of Asia and the Americas could have environmental effects that exceed those of the industrialization of the West. More pressure for change comes from southern Africa and other pockets of extreme poverty where the brutal calculus of Malthus still holds sway. Even in the industrialized north, after generations of prosperity, people are hemmed in by concrete, seeing commuting times grow and starting to question their definition of progress. As a result, countless communities, from the charred fringes of the Amazon to the spreading suburbs of Seattle, are balancing growing needs and limited resources. If development does not change course, the new book concludes, ''the nightmare of an impoverished, mean, destructive future looms.'' Signs of Improvement Unexpected Cleanups Generate Optimism Over the past 30 years, ''sustainability'' has become the mantra of many private groups, government officials, scientists and, even, a growing number of businesses. Most define the notion as advancing human endeavors without diminishing prospects for future generations. The Johannesburg summit will be the third global conclave in that span chasing this elusive goal. But movement toward concrete action has been slow. The first meeting, in Stockholm in 1972, rang an alarm about despoiling the earth. Wealthy nations began cleaning air and water, but continued to assault forests and other resources elsewhere to fuel growth. In 1992 came the second meeting, in Rio de Janeiro, called the Earth Summit. There, diplomats forged ambitious agreements aimed at holding back deserts and protecting the atmosphere, forests and pockets of biological richness. But the agreements were vague, relying more on good will than on concrete obligations. Developing countries refused to take on obligations, saying the north should step first. After Rio, population continued to grow, poverty persisted, forests retreated, soils eroded, fish stocks shrank, and concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases rose, despite a treaty in which industrialized countries pledged to ''strive'' to reduce them. Now, a host of satellites provides streams of data that powerful computers sift and disseminate on the Web. Communities can track forest loss in Indonesia, sprawl in Indiana and the flow of pollution from state to state, country to country. After disasters like the chemical release in Bhopal, India, in 1984 and the grounding of the Exxon Valdez in Alaska in 1989, many companies have shifted practices to avoid environmental damage, shareholder wrath and consumer boycotts. Fast-growing developing countries including China and Mexico are rapidly cutting urban air pollution.. They have been spurred both by commmunity pressure and awareness of the high costs of treating illnesses cause by pollution. Indonesia, China and other countries are posting factories' chemical emissions on the Web. The technique, pioneered in the United States, is prompting cleanups. No one expects that people will be able to manage the planet like some giant corporation -- the real Big Blue. ''If you mean making the thousands of little decisions that need to be made, we can no more effectively manage the world than the Soviet Union could manage its centrally planned economy,'' said Dr. Robert W. Kates, a geographer who headed a National Academy of Sciences committee on sustainable development and is an author of ''Great Transition.'' But Dr. Kates says the potential exists to make informed choices that spread the benefits of development to an impoverished majority while not depleting vital assets. One impediment to such a transition is the change itself, the environmental and societal turbulence created by explosive human growth, technological advance and the planetwide linkup of disparate cultures, Dr. Kates and other experts say. Another barrier, they add, is the enormous growth of population and consumption. Although global population appears headed for a 50 percent increase in the next 50 years, for example, demand for food will likely double, as prosperity raises the per capita consumption of calories. There is another roadblock. Not every problem of consequence comes with a Bhopal-style wake-up call. Global warming and species extinction are examples of potential catastrophes that are hiding in plain sight, experts say. Scientists are helping identify problems and opportunities. But communities will make choices guided only in part by what makes sense for the long haul. For one thing, big gaps persist in the basic information needed to measure progress. When a team from Yale and Columbia studied dozens of trends in 142 countries to rank their sustainability, the members had to leave 40 percent of their spreadsheet blank, said Daniel C. Esty, a Yale law professor, who was a leader of the project. Nonetheless, optimists say they see signs of hope. Not the least of them is the intensifying dialogue on the problem, which includes parties as disparate as multinational companies and tribal bands. In essence, the human capacity for understanding the world is catching up with the human capacity to change it, Dr. Clark at Harvard said. ''It really is a plausible case that we're coming on a key stage now, with the cold war under control, with globalization happening,'' he said. The hard part, he said, will be for societies to overcome a habit of focusing on present needs. ''Do we move beyond simply being a big bull in a china shop, having impacts, to becoming a reflective capacity on the planet?'' Dr. Clark asked. ''Or do we simply bungle ahead?'' An Altered World Human Imprints From Pole to Pole Evidence abounds now that the world is a human-dominated place. By flooding the atmosphere with synthetic chemicals and heat-trapping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, for example, people damaged the protective ozone layer and contributed to a warming climate, scientists have said. The ozone depletion became vividly and unexpectedly evident in the 1980's, when a gaping hole was detected over Antarctica. The hole will shrink in the next 50 years because of a ban on ozone-eating chlorofluorocarbons. Other damage will not be so easy to repair. Long before they are cataloged, thousands of plant and animal species are likely to be driven to extinction as forests, wetlands, mountain slopes and other habitats are exploited or harmed by climate change. Satellites that map vegetation and the nighttime signature of human activity -- fire and light -- show that people have altered more than one-third of the terrestrial landscape. Once it is changed, it is usually changed forever, Dr. G. David Tilman, an ecologist at the University of Minnesota, said. ''When you add another 1,000 acres of shopping mall or another highway, far into the future those are probably close to permanent acts,'' Dr. Tilman said. Where progress is seen, too often it is only in a slowing rate of destruction, ecologists say. For example, new satellite surveys show that forest loss in the tropics through the 1990's occurred at a rate 23 percent less than previous estimates. But losses still add up to some 14 million acres a year, with 5 million more acres visibly damaged. The human imprint is evident almost everywhere. In the South Atlantic, fleets illuminate so much of the ocean to attract squid that the illuminated area dwarfs the megalopolis of São Paulo. The squid harvest has in part grown because commercial fish stocks have been overfished. Altogether, scientists have found that two-thirds of commercial marine fish species are fully exploited or diminishing, prompting companies to move down the food chain. Aquaculture is a fast-growing alternative, but often causes damage like the destruction of coastal mangroves in southern Asia to make way for shrimp farms. Also, in many cases, farmed species are fed fish meal made of other fish. So the cultivation still indirectly depletes the oceans. Hydrologists estimate that people appropriate half the world's flowing fresh water. Across the American West in the last 20 years, circular patches made by great rotating irrigation rigs have peppered the land like an expanding checkerboard, marking the draining of aquifers under the plains. Scientists have concluded that humans not only now dominate the planet, but have also become the dominant driver of natural selection, the machinery of evolution. The main influence, experts say, is the continuing chemical arms race against germs and pests, which kills most, but leaves a resistant minority behind. Also, by wittingly and unwittingly moving myriad species around the globe, humans have become a biological blender, carrying West Nile virus to America and overrunning the Bordeaux countryside in France with American bullfrogs that residents say do not even taste good. Troubling Trends An S.U.V. Culture Shifts to Third World Projections for the next two generations do not bode well for easing environmental problems. Even with the population bomb predicted in the 1960's substantially defused, the human population is likely headed for at least nine billion before leveling off. Most of the growth will be in poor countries, and as people there pursue prosperity, consumption of natural resources will rapidly increase. Half the world's 17,000 major wildlife refuges are already being heavily used for agriculture, recent studies showed. Car companies are racing to build factories to assemble sport utility vehicles in India, even as its once-legendary rail system, plagued by mismanagement, is deteriorating and losing freight and passengers, said Dr. Rajendra K. Pachauri, director general of the Tata Energy Research Institute of India. The private organization assesses energy and environmental problems in India. ''In the last 10 years, every major manufacturer has set up facilities in India,'' Dr. Pachauri said. ''They see it as a major market. They have the buzz of the people. This is something that should cause real concern.'' Depending on how power is generated, bringing electricity to the two billion people in the world who still lack it could greatly increase emissions of greenhouse gases. But, experts note, the options available to those who remain off the grid also cause harm. The two billion people who cook on wood or dung fires live in acrid clouds of toxic smoke and deplete forests. In India, Dr. Pachauri said, millions of people light their homes with kerosene, using government-subsidized fuel. Together, cooking fires and sputtering lanterns create indoor pollution that causes asthma and other ailments and that, in India alone, is estimated to kill 600,000 women a year. Dr. Pachauri's group has experimented with distributing solar-powered lanterns to rural communities. Other projects push cleaner ovens that use less-polluting fuels. But the question of how to take good ideas from pilot projects to the new norm remains largely unsolved. Then there are the costs. For example, about a billion people have no clean water. More than twice that number live where raw sewage flows unchecked. So water is a prime focus of the delegates in Johannesburg. When even countries like the United States lag tens of billions of dollars in improving their sewage systems, experts say the prospects of big investments elsewhere are dim. New Strategies Learning to Harvest More From Less The hardest part of meshing economic and environmental progress, experts say, is that this shift cannot be engineered with top-down directives. It will be a result of 10,000 decisions, large and small, by countries, communities, companies and individuals, said Dr. Kates, the geographer. Action will have to be focused where the human imprint is most intense, in forests, on the farm and in the fast-expanding cities, experts say. An analysis by the World Wildlife Fund found that 20 percent of the existing forest area could provide all the world's future needs for wood and pulp if it was all managed according to environmentally sound practices that a few big companies have already adopted. Some forestry companies and wood and paper buyers, including Home Depot and Ikea, participate in a program in which wood is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, a private group. The council monitors forest holdings and products to ensure that wood marketed as environmentally friendly is produced with limited damage. Other organizations run similar certification programs to encourage growers of other crops like bananas and cocoa to preserve habitat or limit pesticide use. Those efforts remain a tiny fringe of the markets for those commodities. The Forest Stewardship Council has certified 70 million acres of forests -- just 4 percent of the total acreage controlled by timber companies. If farming does not change drastically in the next few decades, enormous ecological damage will result, many scientists say. Dr. Tilman of Minnesota notes that farming has already produced the biggest global imprint of humanity, affecting half the earth's habitable land. The challenge now, he said, will be to double agricultural productivity without using substantially more land. There are signs this can be achieved. In an extraordinary experiment several years ago, in Yunnan Province, China, rice farmers were recruited to intersperse two varieties on 8,000 acres instead of planting one. The yield nearly doubled, and the occurrence of rice blast, the most harmful disease in the world's biggest crop, fell 94 percent. Recognizing a good thing, China has expanded the work to 250,000 acres, said Dr. Christopher C. Mundt, a plant pathologist at Oregon State University who helped conduct the research. ''Perhaps more important,'' he added, ''the Chinese are taking the general concept of diversification into related approaches'' to other crops. The key to the next green revolution, Dr. Mundt said, will be abandoning most of the industrial model of agriculture of the 20th century and shifting to a ''biological model based on management of ecological processes'' like applying fertilizer and water only as needed. Such efforts are being made in agriculture, forestry, fisheries and other fields around the world. But, once again, experts say the challenge lies in moving to the scales needed to avert widespread harm. The Role of the City The Megalopolis As Eco-Strategy Another focal point for experts who envision a managed earth is cities. In many ways, they are where the battle will be won or lost. Cities are where almost all remaining population growth will occur, demographers say. The roster of megacities, those with populations exceeding 10 million, is widely expected to climb, from 20 today to 36 by 2015. These vast metropolises have been widely characterized as a nightmarish element of the new century, sprawling and chaotic and spawning waste and illness. But increasingly, demographers and other experts say that cities may actually be a critical means of limiting environmental damage. Most significantly, they say, family size drops sharply in urban areas. ''The city is perhaps the most effective device for reducing the birthrate,'' said Dr. George Bugliarello, chancellor of the Polytechnic University in Brooklyn and an expert on urban trends. For the poor, access to health care, schools and other basic services is generally greater in the city than in the countryside. Energy is used more efficiently, and drinking and wastewater systems, although lacking now, can be built relatively easily. And for every person who moves to a city, that is one person fewer chopping firewood or poaching game. Still, many cities face decisions now that may permanently alter the quality of human lives and the environment. Dr. Kates said the pivotal nature of these times is perfectly illustrated by Mexico City, which is just behind Tokyo atop the list of megacities. The sprawling megalopolis, where traffic is paralyzed, is about to choose in a referendum between double-decking its downtown highways or expanding its subway system. One course could encourage sprawl and pollution; the other would conserve energy, experts say. Chances of Change 'Pernicious Fad'Or Real Prospect? Some environmentalists say the whole notion of sustainable development is an oxymoron, that the Western industrial model of endless growth, however packaged, cannot possibly persist without grievous environmental damage. At the same time, some business leaders still scoff at the effort. In a new PricewaterhouseCoopers survey of Fortune 1000 executives' attitudes toward sustainable development, one corporate vice president for environmental affairs called the concept ''a pernicious fad.'' Some skeptics note that even if cleaner, less destructive industries take hold everywhere, the sheer volume of economic growth could still cause big problems. But a durable line of pragmatic optimists from science, business and environmental groups, for now, holds center stage. They say that cleaning the environment and reducing poverty are not only required from an ethical standpoint, but also because they are in humanity's self-interest. Without improvements, said Nitin Desai, the United Nations official running the Johannesburg meeting, ''you create societies that live in a state of perpetual hopelessness.'' ''That is obviously going to hit back at you at some stage,'' Mr. Desai said. Hundreds of businesses, though still a minority, have added sustainability managers to their executive roster. Prof. Jeffrey D. Sachs, director of the Columbia University Earth Institute, said the world was quickly shifting from a model in which wealth was derived mainly through exploiting resources. ''Most growth now comes from increased knowledge, not from the mining of nature,'' Professor Sachs said. ''And knowledge isn't limited in the way that, say, soil fertility is.'' Dr. Kates agrees that economic advancement is vital and says evidence is emerging in many places that it can occur without too much environmental harm. Despite federal inaction on climate change, Dr. Kates said, 129 American cities have programs to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, and California has moved to reduce car emissions. ''This fits with history,'' he said. ''States and cities have always been a major set of social experimenters. This was true on disability insurance and child-labor laws, on antimonopoly laws.'' It may well end up being the case that local communities, here and abroad, lead the way in harmonizing people and the planet, he said. ''That ferment,'' Dr. Kates said, ''is the most encouraging sign.'' MANAGING PLANET EARTH Correction: August 26, 2002, Monday An article in Science Times on Tuesday about the impact of humans on global ecosystems misstated the results of an experiment in which farmers in China planted a mixture of two kinds of rice rather than one. (The same error appeared in the section on Aug. 22, 2000, but went unnoticed.) The yield rose 17 percent, nearly doubling for one variety and staying flat for the other; yield did not nearly double for both."
"A severe earthquake rocked a remote area along China's far western border on Monday morning, and Chinese officials said it killed at least 261 people and destroyed thousands of homes and other buildings. Seismology officials said the quake had a magnitude of 6.8 and struck an area around the city of Jiashi, not far from the old Silk Road city of Kashgar and China's mountainous border with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. It hit just after 10 a.m. on Monday, as workers headed to offices and students started classes. Authorities said in telephone interviews from the area that the People's Liberation Army had mobilized troops to help dig through rubble to uncover the dead and injured. By this morning the reported death toll had risen to 261, with estimates of the number of people who suffered injuries running at about 4,000, said Zhang Yong of the Xinjiang Seismological Bureau. ''Not a single house in our area escaped damage,'' said Li Juan, an official in the heavily affected township of Qiongkuer Chake. Ms. Li toured the stricken area after her four-story government headquarters buckled during the quake. ''The dead bodies are lined up all along the streets,'' Ms. Li said. ''It's a horrible sight.'' Residents reached by phone said that in accordance with local custom in the mainly Muslim area, relatives scurried to cover bodies in white cloth and arrange immediate burials. Many people who lost homes covered themselves in blankets against the sub-freezing temperatures. The epicenter was about 25 miles east of the city of Jiashi, in Bachu County. Jiashi is about 35 miles east of Kashgar, which felt the tremor but did not suffer significant casualties or damage. The official New China News Agency reported that nearly 9,000 buildings, including 900 classrooms and at least one large elementary school, were flattened around Bachu. One official blamed poor construction standards for the widespread damage. ''The quality of the buildings in that area is quite bad,'' said Song Lijun, also of the Xinjiang Seismological Bureau. ''Because schools were among the destroyed buildings, we fear that children are among the dead.'' Mr. Song said he was uncertain how far the rescue effort had progressed or whether the death toll would rise substantially. Communications among small towns and villages in the area are considered poor, and officials suggested that it could be days before they knew the extent of the devastation. In Beijing, officials initially played down the severity of the quake. Before meeting Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, President Jiang Zemin of China told reporters he did not consider the quake a major disaster. It seemed likely that Mr. Jiang's comments were based on early reports of light casualties. But as fresh reports came in on Monday, the quake appeared to be one of China's most severe in recent years. Chinese officials are especially sensitive to the potential of tremors to wreak horrific damage since a huge earthquake in Tangshan in 1976 killed an estimated 240,000, one of the worst natural disasters. Official news agencies reported on Monday evening that the central government had dispatched a rescue team to the area and that Wen Jiabao, the man expected to become prime minister at the meeting this spring of the Chinese Parliament, had taken charge of relief work. The area affected in the quake lies about 1,750 miles west of Beijing in the Xinjiang region. The Muslim Uighur minority is the predominant ethnic group in the region, which is one of China's poorest. Though a volatile fault lies under Xinjiang, causing frequent tremors, casualties are generally light. Relatively small numbers of people live outside the handful of big urban areas in the expansive territory, which consists largely of deserts and highlands. Chinese news reports suggested that this was Xinjiang's worst quake in decades. In 1997, a spate of 11 earthquakes struck Xinjiang. One of them, on Jan. 21 of that year, struck only 12 miles from Jiashi, where the tremor occurred, and killed 12 people. One of the largest in recent years came in March 1996. Twenty-four people were reported killed when a quake measuring 6.9 hit an area about 75 miles north of Jiashi. The United States Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., reported that the quake measured 6.3, less severe than the Chinese measurement. It was unclear what accounted for the discrepancy."
"An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.4 and centered near this resort town east of Los Angeles jolted residents awake this morning, but there were no immediate reports of serious damage. ''It was thunderous,'' said Nilla Johnston, who was asleep at the Holiday Inn here when the earthquake hit at 4:19 a.m. ''It felt like it was right here.'' There did not appear to be any serious damage at that hotel, which is owned by Mrs. Johnston and her husband. ''It shook me and woke me up,'' said Scott Kemler, of Fowlerville, Mich., who was staying at the hotel. ''I jumped out of bed, put my clothes on and ran out of the hotel. I probably overreacted, but I don't know about these things, I'm from Michigan.'' Seismologists usually express an earthquake's intensity in moment magnitude, a measure of how much of the earth moved at the moment of the shock, and how far. An earthquake with a magnitude of 6 releases 32 times as much energy as a magnitude 5 quake, and about 1,000 times as much as a magnitude 4 quake. This morning's earthquake rattled buildings as far away as downtown Los Angeles, 90 miles from the center, which was four miles north of Big Bear City, a town just east of here. The Associated Press quoted Kate Hutton, a seismologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, as saying the main quake did not appear to be an aftershock of any previous quake. It appeared to be a new earthquake sequence in an area well known for seismic activity. There did not appear to be any link to the 1992 Landers-Big Bear quakes, which killed one person and caused $100 million in damage. The magnitude-7.3 Landers earthquake on June 28, 1992, was followed a few hours later by a magnitude-6.5 quake in the nearby San Bernardino Mountains."
"Some thought it was a tree toppling in the yard or an electrical transformer blowing, or even the Tappan Zee Bridge collapsing. Two small earthquakes in five days gave a psychological jolt to this Hudson River village and neighboring towns, with many residents learning for the first time that they live on a fault line. The first quake, centered here, occurred on Friday at 9:24 p.m. and measured 1.2 on the Richter scale, according to the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, in Palisades, N.Y. The second happened on Tuesday at 7:58 p.m., two kilometers from here in the town of Greenburgh. It measured 1.4. Many residents experienced the Friday quake as a deep, resonating explosion, while the one on Tuesday night felt more like a rumble, according to police officers in Hastings, Dobbs Ferry, Greenburgh, Irvington and Ardsley who fielded scores of calls from nervous residents. ''The majority of the people said they heard an explosion and the house shook,'' said Sgt. Robert Palumbo of the Hastings Police Department. ''We got 100 to 150 calls. People were concerned.'' The earthquakes caused no damage. Won-Young Kim, a research scientist at the Earth Observatory, said that structural damage rarely occurred during an earthquake with a magnitude of less than 4. A fault line that runs southeast from Dobbs Ferry into Greenburgh was responsible for the two earthquakes, Dr. Kim said. In 1985, an earthquake centered in nearby Ardsley measured 4.1 and was felt in five states and southern Canada. Reaction to the earthquakes in the last week was colored by the threat of terrorism and talk of war with Iraq, some residents said. ''The girls had just gotten out of the bath and all of a sudden there was a really strange sound and we felt the house shudder,'' said Janet Stoner, a real estate agent and mother of two. ''My husband looked at me and I looked at him, and he said, 'What was that?' '' She added: ''It was a big boom, but it was a noise I had never heard before, so all sorts of things went through my mind. I wondered if they were doing some military maneuvers.''"
"A slight earthquake hit Westchester County last night, but did not cause any serious injuries or property damage, said Won-Young Kim, a research scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, situated in Rockland County. The quake, which had a magnitude of 1.2 on the Richter scale, struck at 9:24 p.m. Residents in Greenburgh, Irvington and other places reported hearing an explosion or feeling the earth shake. The epicenter was estimated to be in Hastings-on-Hudson, Mr. Kim said."
"President Vicente Fox declared a state of emergency today in Colima, a coastal state hit overnight by a powerful earthquake that rolled across central Mexico from the Pacific Ocean, killing at least 29 people and rattling millions of Mexico City residents. ''This was an earthquake of great magnitude,'' Mr. Fox said. ''Luckily, its consequences were not as grave as could have been expected.'' Red Cross officials and civil defense officers reported 26 deaths in Colima, where at least 166 homes were badly damaged or destroyed, two deaths in the neighboring state of Jalisco and one in the state of Michoacán. Most of the dead lived in adobe buildings, and most were very poor, very old or very young, officials said. Roughly 300 injuries were reported, mostly broken bones. Rescue crews continued searching for more victims in Colima today. The quake struck at 8:07 p.m. First reports placed its magnitude at either 7.6 or 7.8 and its epicenter in the ocean about about 30 miles from the port of Manzanillo. In Colima, one of Mexico's smallest states, about 300 miles due west of Mexico City, ''the destruction is like a war zone,'' said a Red Cross official, Enrique de Jesús Rivera. He said in an interview that the death toll could increase as rescuers poked through the rubble of shattered homes and began reaching more isolated villages. Gov. Fernando Moreno said 18 of the 26 deaths in his state were in the capital, also called Colima, about 32 miles north-northeast of the epicenter. The Mexican Army set up six shelters to house at least 2,000 people tonight. A series of aftershocks shook the region into this afternoon. ''We are all waiting for the next one to hit,'' said Arturo Briz, a chauffeur in the city of Colima. The civil defense director in Colima, César Espinosa Solarzano, said about 40 percent of the structures in the capital suffered some damage, mostly old adobe homes in the northeast of the city. In a telephone interview, he said deaths had been registered in the capital and in outlying villages. Mexico's National Seismological Service recorded the magnitude of the earthquake at 7.6. The United States Geological Survey placed its intensity at 7.8, which would make it the second-strongest to have struck Mexico since 1985. The 1985 quake, one of the most devastating of the 20th century, measuring 8.1, killed at least 10,000 people, injured 30,000, caused $5 billion worth of damage and left 100,000 homeless in Mexico City alone. In the capital, millions felt Tuesday night's quake and many, remembering its deadly predecessor, fled to the streets. Power and telephone service were disrupted in Mexico City and in many other municipalities. But the quake, felt for about 45 seconds, caused little harm in the capital beyond racing pulses. Colima last suffered a major earthquake in 1995. That one killed 49 people, including 18 who died in the collapse of the eight-story Costa Real resort hotel in Manzanillo. In Jalisco, to the north of Colima, the earthquake killed a woman of 85 and a 1-year-old girl in the town of Zapotitlán, said the state civil defense chief, Trinidad López Rivas. In the state capital, Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city with about six million residents, at least 40 homes were damaged and 100 people left homeless, state officials said. Bells fell from the tower of a colonial church in the city, more than 100 miles from the epicenter."
"This spring, as people in the Pacific Northwest have gone about their usual drizzly business, an earthquake has been going on for weeks beneath their feet, unbeknownst to everyone but a very few, very excited scientists. While this quake, which began in early March, lacks any bridge-collapsing punch, scientists say it is of great interest as the latest in a newly discovered cycle of highly regular earthquakes. This cycle is so regular that last year, scientists were willing to predict that the next one would hit the Northwest this spring, as it has. Perhaps even more important, scientists say these so-called slow quakes may play a role in setting off much more powerful earthquakes. The slow quakes can release as much energy over weeks as the Nisqually temblor that struck the region two years ago. Researchers have recently found evidence that slow quakes appear to have preceded huge earthquakes in Chile and Japan, suggesting that the subtle quakes could be a precursor to a devastating one in the Northwest. ''It can be the straw that breaks the camel's back,'' said Dr. Anthony Qamar, a seismologist at University of Washington. ''The silent quake could be sufficient to trigger it.'' These quakes are called by a variety of names, including slow quakes, silent quakes or silent slips. Researchers say they do not yet know why the silent quakes in the Northwest appear to be coming in such regular fashion, recurring every 14 1/2 months or so. The quakes are so hard to detect that while some researchers say the latest quake may still be going on, at least one researcher says it is not clear if this latest event, which was not actually expected until late April, has in fact begun. The difficulty is that the quakes are too subtle to be detected with the usual seismometers, which record the motion of a typical earthquake. Instead researchers first detected the slow quakes on a global positioning system, or G.P.S. While most people use G.P.S. instruments to identify a supposedly fixed location, these geologists use them to track how the land is slowly and continually moving. If one thinks of the earth as an egg covered by a cracked shell, then each bit of shell can be thought of as one of the oceanic or continental plates. Each plate slowly moves about on the earth's surface. In the Northwest just off the coast under the Pacific Ocean, one such oceanic plate, known as the Juan de Fuca plate, is bumping into and diving beneath the continental plate, which holds things like the state of Washington. To study how the continental plate is moving, researchers set up a network of G.P.S. stations and watched to see how their locations changed over time. The researchers found that the continental plate and the positioning monitors on them were moving slowly but continually, as expected, and were heading to the northeast. But the researchers noticed that sometimes some of the stations would suddenly shift and move in the opposite direction, to the southwest, just a few scant millimeters, for a few weeks. Eventually all of the monitors would return to their usual path until some 14 1/2 months later, then the instruments would temporarily shift southwest once again. A blip in the readings almost too small to notice, it turns out, was the signal of the silent quake. Researchers say the silent earthquakes are happening along the fault where the Juan de Fuca and continental plates are sliding past each other but far below the earth's surface, so far down that the plates are very hot and extremely plastic. ''Once you get deep enough, things get so hot that the plates actually trundle past each other continuously,'' said Dr. Herb Dragert, research scientist at the Geological Survey of Canada. ''But the plates can get hung up at those depths as well; then the stress accumulates, and when it gets released, that's what we call a slow earthquake.'' But all of this would be academic if it were not for the fact that higher along that fault -- where those same two plates are cooler, crustier and closer to the surface -- the Juan de Fuca plate and the continental plate are locked together, building up the energy and stress that when released will produce a devastating, megathrust earthquake in the region. Scientists say that when stress is released on one part of a fault -- for example deep down where the slow earthquake happens -- it can increase the stress elsewhere. ''If the stress on the locked portion is close to being critical and getting close to the breaking strength of the rock,'' Dr. Dragert said, ''then one of these small slips could be the agent, the last little push.'' People in the Northwest have long been urged to brace for the ''big one.'' A megathrust earthquake along the fault between the Juan de Fuca and continental plates would qualify as such a catastrophe, as might a quake along a separate hazard, in the Seattle fault zone. But whether residents should be especially prepared for a megathrust earthquake every 14 1/2 months when another silent earthquake comes along, researchers say they do not know enough yet to say. ''Should we go into a period of heightened awareness and preparation?'' asked Dr. Meghan Miller, a geological researcher at Central Washington University. ''That interests me. But I don't think we're quite there yet. We only just discovered all this last year.'' Looking over the past 10 years, researchers have found eight slow quakes in the region. If all goes as expected, Dr. Dragert said the next one should start moving the G.P.S. monitors to the southwest sometime in June 2004. But just how regular this cycle of slow quakes will be remains to be seen. Researchers caution that the most predictable-seeming earthquakes have fooled researchers. Along what is known as the Parkfield section of the San Andreas fault in California, Dr. Miller said, magnitude six earthquakes occurred every 20 years or so through much of the 1900's, so regularly that scientists made extensive preparations for a 1980 earthquake that never occurred. ''We've spent a lot of time and energy to monitor this,'' Dr. Miller said. ''And I think we're still waiting for the 1980 event.''"
"The rolling pine forests, snowcapped mountains and crisp fall evenings here tend to make people forget the fact that the park sits atop a huge simmering underground volcano. But new geologic events have served up reminders. In a few days in July, acidic ground water dissolved parts of the unpaved trails in the Norris Geyser Basin, and the ground temperature of the trails shot up to 200 degrees from the usual maximum of 80. Park officials closed nearly half of the basin's trails, and they remain shut. On Aug. 21, a magnitude 4.4 earthquake shook the southern boundary of the park and startled residents. Yellowstone is one of the most seismically active places on the planet, with hundreds of shakes and shimmers throughout the year. They reach magnitude 4 usually only every other year. In the park, such events are no great surprise. ''Change is what we expect in Yellowstone,'' said the park geologist, Hank Heasler. Although there is no indication that any of the changes suggest an impending eruption, even that would not be so surprising. Over last 630,000 years, Yellowstone has experienced 29 eruptions the size of the one on Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991. The average interval here has been 20,000 years, and 70,000 have passed since its last eruption. But the volcano, with a caldera 45 by 28 miles, has the potential for far more catastrophic explosions. The last major eruption, estimated at a magnitude 1,000 times as great as the Mount St. Helens explosion of 1980, was 627,000 years ago. The ancient blast blew up miles of mountain range, and ash from it has been uncovered in 22 Western states. It was so thick 1,000 miles away in Kansas that it was mined in the 1930's and used to make a cleanser. Whether the caldera erupts or not, the stew of partly molten rock 5 to 10 miles below the park exerts a powerful and constant influence. ''The whole of the Yellowstone Plateau is going up and down from the magma,'' averaging one and a half centimeters a year, said Dr. Robert B. Smith, a professor of geophysics at the University of Utah and a member of the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. ''It's like a living, breathing thing.'' In light of the new activity, safety is a growing concern, and officials are writing a hazard plan in case the region grows more active. The ground warming could mean that heat is increasing water pressure, a possible cause of eruptions. In 1989, Porkchop Geyser in Norris Basin became clogged with silica. It exploded and created a 12-foot-wide crater now called Porkchop Hot Spring. A hydrothermal explosion at Mary Bay in Yellowstone Lake some 13,000 years ago blew out a crater more than three miles across. Serious earthquakes are always a possibility. Even though the temblor on Aug. 21 caused no damage, it was widely felt. The largest quake recorded in the West, 7.5 on the old Richter scale, was centered just outside the park in 1959. It dislodged a huge slice of a mountain west of the park, buried 25 campers as they slept in a national forest campground and dammed the Madison River to create Quake Lake. One question that occupies geologists is how the caldera affects fault lines and vice versa. Five major faults terminate in the molten caldera, and even far-flung events can shake the earth here. In November 2002, a magnitude 7.9 quake in Denali National Park in Alaska rippled through the region, leading to more than 500 other quakes that Dr. Smith watched simultaneously on a computer in Utah. ''The whole of Yellowstone lit up like a Christmas tree,'' he said. ''It was exciting. I had a ranger call me and say, 'I've called you before about earthquakes, but these are coming at us from all directions.' '' Except for the quake two months ago, Yellowstone has had far fewer quakes in recent years. ''Seismically, its been deathly quiet,'' Dr. Smith said. ''We average a half-dozen to 20 quakes'' a day. ''The last two years, we see a couple a day.'' The energy of the quakes has been harnessed to shed light on the volcano. A measuring method, seismic tomography, which is similar to C.T. scanning, uses the shock waves that the quakes generate to map structures deep in the earth. Figures from 12,000 quakes gave Dr. Smith a picture of the size and shape of the magma chamber. The magma also fuels geothermal features. All the geyser basins are similar, in that they sit over porous channelized rock layers that contain water under pressure. The water seeps toward the magma zone, where it is superheated. As the water is forced back toward the surface, the pressure is relieved and volume expands, causing geysers to erupt. Even among the steaming, hissing and bubbling landscapes here, Norris Basin stands out. Steamboat Geyser is the tallest one in the park, at 380 feet, more than twice as high as Old Faithful. Test drilling in 1929 measured water temperatures 265 feet down at 400 degrees, and drilling equipment had to be withdrawn. ''The geothermal features of Norris are equally amazing to scientists who have been here for 30 years or someone on their first visit,'' said Mr. Heasler, the geologist. Each year, a disturbance at Norris alters features and muddies the water. This year, the disturbance, on July 11, was more severe than usual. Because the ''plumbing'' is underground, the more precise mechanics of geyser basins are not well understood, and why Norris Basin has changed so markedly and suddenly is guesswork. ''The most common hypothesis is that snowmelt wanes and the water table lowers and weight on the system decreases and, as a result, the water boils more aggressively,'' said Dr. Jake Lowenstern, a geologist at the United States Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif., who is in charge of the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. Many features took longer than usual to return to base line, although some have not returned. Echinus Geyser once erupted frequently, every 35 to 75 minutes. In 1998 it switched to an irregular pattern. It had been erupting every two to nine hours before this season's disturbance, which somehow made it blow on a schedule again, every 3 hours 30 minutes to 3 hours 40 minutes. The geyser has now reverted to irregularity. Pearl Geyser, an erupting pool named for its opalescent blue color, usually has two-meter eruptions. After the disturbance, it changed color to crystal clear, then became a steam vent and later returned to an opalescent pool with one-meter eruptions. At the northern end of the basin, a series of vents, or fumaroles, appeared and mud pots cropped up on the trail, splattering hot acidic mud, though it later disappeared. ''Norris,'' Mr. Heasler said, ''is showing us something, and whether we can figure it out, we'll see.''"
"OF all the places we've lived over the years -- Kansas City, Philadelphia, New York, Johannesburg, Houston -- Los Angeles was the one where we found that friends who said, ''Oh yes, we'll come visit,'' actually did. My family and I lived for four years in a ranch house at the top of the Hollywood Hills, our backyard plummeting down toward a cityscape grid of lights and freeways, the horizon a corrugated jumble of mountains against cloudless sky. We loved it. In all those years, we took not one vacation outside the state. But it was a trickier proposition when visitors came, because driving five hours into the High Sierra to stare at a giant sequoia was not what they had in mind. What did they want? Celebrities. Big houses. Conspicuous consumption. A sense of dipping their toes into a hedonistic way of life they'd seen fetishized on T.V. But the places that ostensibly promised to deliver those things were uniformly underwhelming. Hollywood Boulevard? It's a pit. A movie studio tour? Like visiting any other factory. Celebrity spotting? Easier in New York. Movie star homes? Hidden behind hedges. Malibu? Also hidden, but by a wall of garages and strip malls. What they really wanted was a sense of the famous Southern California lifestyle, what it might be like to live it and how close it came to the stereotypes they'd accumulated. Thus, a walk along the Santa Monica palisades, staring down at the Pacific and watching the pretty young things on Roller-blades, was more gratifying than conniving for a table at a supposed celebrity hangout only to pay through the nose to watch a bunch of other anonymous people wonder who you are. But there was something else people wanted from their California trip -- validation. Nothing was as satisfying to visitors as conversation on two topics: California's inherent goofiness and its penchant for delivering regular doses of calamity, whether in the form of earthquakes, storms or fires. Sure, they didn't have perfect weather and backyard paradises back home, but at least their neighborhood flake quotient was kept to a manageable level and they didn't have any doomsday serpent slithering through the underbrush. And then, almost from the moment our luggage-laden car slipped into Nevada four months ago during our move back to New York, California seemed determined to live up to every stereotype we'd been strenuously denying all those years. First, the state had a kind of political conniption with the baffling fever dream that was the gubernatorial recall election. Then, Southern California had one of its apocalyptic outbursts -- a series of epic wildfires that scorched 750,000 acres, left 22 dead and destroyed more than 3,600 homes. Take a look at that first number again: 750,000 acres is just about 1,172 square miles. The entire State of Rhode Island is only 1,045 square miles. It's as if New York City -- all five boroughs -- were burned four times over. ''Is your old neighborhood in any danger?,'' new neighbors asked us. Oh, no, no, we'd say. Laurel Canyon, where we lived, was a good hour's drive from the Simi Valley, where the nearest of the fires raged. It would be like someone in Poughkeepsie worrying about a fire in Princeton. But at the same time, we'd call friends back in California and they'd say, Yeah, the sky is coated with an ashy haze and there's a bad barbecue stink on the wind. They'd say it in a tone of voice we had come to recognize in our four years there, a kind of here-we-go-again resignation. Or maybe we were just more attuned to it now, joining the others who view California from afar. ''That which does not appear to exist is to be regarded as if it did not exist,'' says the Maxims of Jurisprudence of the California Civil Code. But as we learned when we lived there, it's easier said than done. In Los Angeles, you send your kids to school with earthquake kits, including bottled water, snacks and a reassuring note from Mom, just in case. And even in our canyon, which had never experienced a major fire, no company would sell fire insurance, forcing residents to buy into a state-run system that essentially taxed everyone else in the state a little bit more so we canyon rats could rebuild in the event of disaster. The good news was that our particular stretch of the Hollywood Hills was built on solid granite, putting it in the safest zone possible in the event of earthquake -- the safest zone in Southern California, that is, which is kind of like saying it's the highest point in Atlantis. ''You must be glad you're not there now,'' people said to us when the wildfires filled the morning papers and the nightly news. Actually, we'd gotten kind of used to narrowly averting California apocalypses. On Oct. 16, 1999, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit a desolate area called Hector Mine, about 45 miles east of Barstow in the middle of the Mojave Desert. But the tremors were strong enough to rattle windows and topple furniture in parts of the Los Angeles basin. It was the only really significant quake during our four years in California. Friends told us that they were certain, just for a moment, that this was it, the Big One, time to pay the piper for that perfect tan. But we were hundreds of miles away, up in the Napa Valley, sleeping off a pleasant dinner that included too much wine, and we missed the whole thing. And while we lived through a series of wildfire scares, some not so far away from Laurel Canyon, when the Big Ones came this year, we were safely across the country, under a leafy canopy of East Coast suburbia, pungent with autumn vapors. And we noticed something else, too. Just as in California, we were living here, in the Westchester suburbs, among neighbors who had had their own close brush with apocalypse on Sept. 11 -- another disaster that we'd missed by happenstance, but that seemed to simmer in the back of all of our neighbors' brains. ''Do you miss California?,'' people ask us all the time. The real answer is yes. And no. And in a way, it's as if we never left. Is there anyplace left in America where you can live without having to suppress the fear of apocalypse? ''Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year,'' wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson. ''No man has learned anything rightly, until he knows that every day is Doomsday.'' Essay RICK LYMAN is a national correspondent for The Times."
"There seemed to be some vague symmetry in the air when I asked the gas station attendant in Paso Robles how best to get across to Parkfield, a tiny village buried in a valley near the Cholame Hills in central California. ''Head east on 46,'' he said. ''Then watch out for the James Dean Memorial, and turn left again just after it. Then 10 miles up the road. Can't miss it.'' I suppose I ought to have known, being a fan of ''Giant'' and ''East of Eden,'' just where it was that Jimmy Dean had crashed his silver Porsche Spyder back in 1955. But I didn't know, and said so to the old-timer pumping the ethyl, and told him I was really heading out to see the earthquake capital of America, which was how some people describe Parkfield. ''So I've heard,'' he grunted. Then he paused. ''But you know, folks say the day Jimmy Dean was killed was something like an earthquake, too. And then you've got to look at the inscription they've written on his plaque before you turn. It's kind of prophetic, I've heard some folks say. Even creepy.'' When I found it, it was an inscription from Saint-Exupéry's ''Little Prince,'' said to be Dean's favorite line: ''What is essential is invisible to the eye,'' etched into the steel. And yes, the words did indeed seem uncannily appropriate. For the essential entity that has made nearby Parkfield so famous to many is, as it happens, entirely invisible -- the 740-mile-long San Andreas fault, the direct cause of so many of California's more dramatic problems, which happens to pass directly underneath and through and all around this otherwise utterly forgettable hamlet of some 35 people. The existence of the great fault, and the extraordinary effects it has and may yet have on the big cities near which it passes -- San Francisco most notably, and in 1906 and 1989 most ruinously -- have served to make Parkfield not merely the seismic mecca of the United States, but, in all likelihood, the most pored over and geologically examined town, not just in North America, but on the entire surface of the planet. In the towns where the fault snaps on occasion, people suffer from it; in places like Parkfield, where it moves slowly, opening at fingernail growth rate each year, they come from all over to measure it. Parkfield is a sleepy, pretty place of barley fields and well-rounded hills, of dust and live oak trees and slow-moving streams and, in the evening, huddles of long-shadowed cattle in the corners of the meadows. This is big ranching country, and one of the local cattlemen, Jack Varian, and his son John have tried to capitalize on its tectonic siting by building a cafe in what he likes to call the Earthquake Capital of the World, with the slogan ''Be Here When It Happens'' painted on its water tower. He has a hotel across the road that advises passers-by -- who have nowhere else to bed down, for this is a lonesome place -- to ''Sleep Here When It Happens.'' His restaurant offers a steak called The Big One, a smaller version called Magnitude 6 and desserts known as Aftershocks. The San Andreas fault runs along (and, indeed, causes the route of) the local creek, and the iron-lattice bridge across it has been impressively bent and distorted -- by 28 inches -- since it was built in 1932. There is something strangely awe-inspiring about strolling along the creek below: if you head northward, then the low hills that rise up on your left-hand side are on one of the earth's tectonic plates -- the Pacific plate -- while those on the right, which sport markedly different vegetation, different trees, darker grasses, are on the North American plate. The creek may look innocent enough, burbling and trilling and meandering along; but, in fact, it marks one of the great suture lines of the world, and if you are canny enough to recognize it as such -- the rocks on either side are very different, though this may not be readily apparent unless you carry a hammer with you on your daily strolls -- you can feel curiously privileged to be walking along it. What makes the region truly interesting, however, are the scientists one encounters here, and the instruments they employ and, more important, those they are about to employ, all designed to delve deeply and properly into the fault's mysteries. The activities are coordinated from a small steel building close to the hotel, in which, these days, a genial geologist named Andy Snyder -- always available to any passing stranger who is interested -- keeps an eye on an array of instruments that, in turn, keep an eye on the earth below. I knocked on his door one afternoon, and he popped out like a jack rabbit, keen as a man who hasn't spoken to a stranger for days. He showed me maps, charts, diagrams. He pointed out to me just where the fault shears through the landscape -- this hill, that valley, those groves of trees, behind that cow. Nope! It moved, darn it! He directed me to a hilltop where a team from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, in La Jolla, was establishing a network of real-time Global Positioning System monitors, which measure sites to an accuracy of one-twentieth of an inch and should be able to show hills sliding past each other at what, on this scale, looks like a breakneck pace. Even fingernail growth rates should be noticed by these machines, he said. My dog, Bailey, who accompanied me on my peregrinations along the fault, walked with me up to the low summit, where we found a wooden hut with Yehuda Bock, a scientist born in Israel, inside, who, when I asked, was equally eager to show off what he was doing. ''Isn't this God's country?'' he kept saying. ''You can see the fault's effects everywhere. They're not just amazing -- they're beautiful, too.'' And I had to agree. Up here, where it wasn't so dusty, and where a breeze stirred the oak leaves and left it a little cooler than below and where you could see signs of the geology changing across the two plates -- the hills a different shape, the color of the meadows subtly varied -- the awe I had felt in the creek below returned, in spades. God's country, indeed. Ten miles up the road an even more ambitious program, a collaboration between the United States Geological Survey and Stanford University, is in the works: a deep bore hole is being drilled so that geologists can drop instruments down into the very heart of the fault and measure its creaks and groans as it shifts under the impress of mysterious and little-understood forces deep within the planet. A pilot hole has already been sunk; the major one is still waiting for additional funds from Washington, and may be started next May. The drilling crew sees very few people; and, like Andy Snyder and Yehuda Bock, they fall over themselves to tell passers-by what they are doing, and why. It seems that the fault excites people to share its mysteries -- not least, perhaps, because those who study it are, in essence, trying to work out why it causes such monster earthquakes, and work out how best to warn people that one is coming. Although Parkfield is, perhaps, the most idyllic and bucolically endearing place to see the fault, there are scores of other sites between Shelter Cove (where the San Andreas comes ashore in northern California's Humboldt County) and the mud volcanoes at the southern end of the Salton Sea (where it fades away into the baking desert of the Imperial Valley) where a casual wanderer may witness it. The Pinnacles National Monument, a set of curiously shaped rocky spires is another: the feature is actually split into two parts, one on the west side of the fault, another on the east, and the two are separated by the more than 120 miles that the San Andreas has moved since the lava that formed the pinnacles was extruded. There is also Olema, 30 miles north of San Francisco, where farm fences sitting on the fault were broken and moved no fewer than 21 feet by the savagery of the 1906 earthquake. And at nearby Point Reyes, the fault passes out into the Pacific Ocean. Geologists find Parkfield especially fascinating because the fault here is unlocked, the plates on either side edging slowly past each other. In both Northern and Southern California, however, it is locked, and when it occasionally comes unstuck it does so spectacularly and dangerously. Two sites, readily accessible, display its power. I drove out from the Silicon Valley town of Palo Alto, heading westward up the ever more winding and precipitous Page Mill Road, until, close to the summit of a ridge of hills, there is a small and cozy wilderness area known as Los Trancos Open Space Preserve. Here I parked the car and set off walking -- with Bailey, though a sign warned me that animals were unwelcome -- and immediately found myself deep in a forest that was alive with signs of seismic activity. The fault runs directly through these woods: there are oddly sited cliffs and landslides, shallow lakes caused by water accumulating in the fault-crushed rocks along the line and, on top of one hill, boulders of a kind only found on the slopes of Mount Loma Prieta, which I could spy looming hotly out on the distance, some 20 miles to the south. The fault had carried these rocks with it, over thousands of years: it had acted like a gigantic conveyor belt, moving jerkily along (not smoothly, as in Parkfield), causing earthquakes as it did so. Most of these temblors went unfelt, simply because they happened long ago when there were no Californians around to feel them; all those in the past century, however, have been felt, and some of them have cost lives. Los Trancos preserve -- which has a score of tidy explanatory signs and unobtrusive finger posts and other indicators -- allows a visitor to understand the dangerous majesty of the San Andreas and, by understanding it, to explain what it does and may yet do. The second exposure of the unlocked fault I saw a week later, 300 miles to the south of Palo Alto, and in the company of Susan E. Hough, a government seismologist who works at the California Institute of Technology, in Pasadena. She is a great San Andreas enthusiast, and has taken years to plot with great precision exactly where it courses through the hot and craggy landscapes east of Los Angeles. On this occasion we were looking at it in a road cut, where Route 14 cuts north through the town of Palmdale, and where there are factories that make space shuttles and spy planes and where from distant runways B-1 bombers soar up into the clear blue skies on sinister test flights. Gazing at geology can make you forget; it is often easy to block the real world from your mind. And in the road cut here, the fault is most spectacular -- immense rainbow distortions of twisted rock rise and swirl through the cut cliffs, each one a testament to the huge forces that have set the two plates shifting past each other over the eons. We stood in the fierce desert heat together, ogling and photographing the layers and slabs and contorted horizons -- the Pacific plate on one side, the North American on the other. (The space factories, coincidentally, lie on the American plate.) The traffic whooshed by. A police car slowed and looked at us. She is often in trouble with the law, Susan explained. ''No one seems to understand why people like me stop our cars in dangerous places, and climb cliffs and begin hammering things to find out about the fault. People just don't get it. But to me, the San Andreas is exquisite, and beautiful and, moreover, it means something. But policemen out here don't seem to have much imagination. You have to have imagination, and a sense of deep curiosity, to want to come to a place like this.'' And a deep sense of attachment to planet Earth, one might add. Over the previous couple of weeks I had trekked and driven and sailed the entire length of the San Andreas fault, from the foggy cold of Mendocino to the pitiless heat of El Centro -- a journey that anyone with time and a sense of imagination might just as easily accomplish in even less time. In most places the fault -- which is perhaps the most notorious of all geology's ley lines -- is quite visible, but perhaps only if you know what you're looking for. In others -- Los Trancos, Parkfield, here on the traffic-choked Route 14 near Palmdale -- it makes itself more than amply noticeable, forcing itself into entirely public view. Maybe one day the workings of the San Andreas fault will become predictable -- the Parkfield experts hope to see to that -- and people will be able to avoid the terrible drama of what it can on occasion do. But for now the fault simply stands there, full of foreboding and potential. To those with a keen eye, a fondness for maps and for finding offbeat places, there is recognizable evidence of its existence and its subterranean passage all across California -- places that those with a keen sense of wonder about the world and for the subtle beauties of geology will find utterly unforgettable. Simon Winchester, the author of ''The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary'' (Oxford), is working on a book about the 1906 San Francisco earthquake."
"The ground still trembles here, although aftershocks from Thursday's devastating earthquake in southeastern Turkey have not slowed frantic rescue efforts at a collapsed boarding school where more than 60 students remain buried. Most are probably dead, but emergency workers are hopeful some are still alive. From dawn to dusk today, rescue workers in orange jumpsuits dug through a huge pile of concrete and steel, all that is left of a four-story dormitory where 198 students were sleeping when the quake hit in the middle of the night. So far, 45 bodies have been recovered. Relatives watched the search with forlorn looks, kept back by security personnel. From time to time there was a commotion as a body was discovered, and family members surged forward for a glimpse. More often, it was another victim, a child crushed in the collapse. But in the day's only glimmer of hope, tiny Enes Gunce, a sixth grader, was found alive 30 hours after his bedroom collapsed around him. Onlookers erupted in cheers. ''I had no hope that Enes would be alive, but he fell in a little gap,'' said his uncle, Baki Anacur, who helped recover the boy. ''There might be others who are small enough to fit in the gaps.'' But the authorities said that was unlikely. They called in a crane to dig at the wreckage, exposing more victims of an earthquake that has killed at least 118 people and injured 500 more. The quake, which had a magnitude of 6.4, lasted only 17 seconds, but it came along one of Turkey's two major fault lines and left damage for miles. Hundreds of angry survivors converged on the governor's office here to demand more tents and other relief supplies. Some demonstrators, mainly Kurds who have a longstanding mistrust of the Turkish police, tried to storm the building, and the police fired automatic weapons into the air to disperse them. Other protesters stoned police vehicles, prompting authorities to call in heavily armed reinforcements. The tensions between eastern Turkey's predominantly Kurdish population and government security forces are tied to the war that Kurdish rebels have waged in this mountainous area for 15 years, prompting fierce crackdowns. Government officials accused Kurdish rebels today of trying to take advantage of the natural disaster to press their cause. But some protesters said security forces had overreacted, and displaced people called on the area's governor, Huseyin Avni Cos, to help them find shelter or resign. ''We just came here to get tents,'' one protester, Ramazan Yararli, told The Associated Press. ''But they started firing on us.'' At the boarding school, the worst of the many damaged buildings around Bingol, the cries for help that emergency workers heard coming from the wreckage throughout the day on Thursday had stopped by today. Rescue crews stopped their digging for two hours this morning so that sonar equipment could be trained on the fallen school. ''There were no sounds, no voices,'' one worker said. Desperate faces surrounded the school site. There were mothers and fathers praying for a miracle. There were crestfallen teachers. Some students who were rescued waited for a similar fate for their friends. ''A lot of my friends are missing,'' Zulkuf Ercan, 13, said, rattling off the names of Vedat, Serafettin, Mesut and Yavuz, all of whom were still trapped inside, as far as he knew. One teacher took roll call of those students who gathered around the damaged school, just as she does daily, although this time it was to determine who had survived and who was still trapped inside. ''We hope he's still alive,'' Ali Yalcin, 46, said of his nephew, who is 13. ''That's all we can do -- wait and hope.'' One young girl, Bircan Dolgun, had her scarf swept from her head down to her shoulders as she cried heavily near the fallen dormitory. She mumbled her brother's name between sobs. ''I have been waiting here for two days,'' she said. ''Everybody goes home with their brother, and mine is still in there. Where is he?'' The police sought to push the relatives from the scene, but they inched their way back, many with tears in their eyes. Some of the survivors recounted the terrifying moments they endured, beginning at 3:27 a.m., when their dormitory began shaking with a fury. ''It was just an ordinary night,'' said Zulkuf, who was in a room on the top floor of the four-story dormitory with eight other boys. ''I washed my face before I went to bed. It was 9:30, the usual time. But later the bed started shaking and all of us ended up on the floor.'' The ceiling caved in, and all eight boys in Zulkuf's room were crowded together in a crevice. Two among them were crushed by the rubble. The others scrambled to escape. The boys said they had begun to dig through the bricks when a small hole emerged. One boy tried to signal the villagers who had arrived with the fluorescent light on his wristwatch. Teachers living in a separate building that was largely undamaged ran to their cars and trained the headlights on the crumpled school. The scene was frightening. The school's four floors had become just one, and dazed children in pajamas were crawling through the giant pile of rubble. ''It was the worst thing I'll ever see,'' said Bahar Yilmaz, 27, a teacher, who had put the students to bed that night. ''I lost one colleague and I lost so many children.'' Scientists said the damage could have been even worse. The earthquake occurred along the East Anatolian fault, and appears to have been unrelated to a succession of devastating quakes that have struck west to east along the North Anatolian fault since 1939. In 1999, 17,000 people were killed in an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 on the North Anatolian fault near the town of Izmit in northwestern Turkey, 900 miles to the west of Thursday's earthquake. Motion along the East Anatolian fault is slower than along the North Anatolian fault, and the quakes in this region are typically smaller in magnitude. An earthquake of similar magnitude in 1971 that struck just 30 miles to the southwest of Thursday's epicenter killed 1,000 people. Dr. M. Nafi Toksoz, a professor of geophysics and seismology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said construction standards improved in that part of Turkey after the 1971 earthquake. ''As a whole, it's encouraging that things have improved since 1971, that lessons were learned and applied,'' Dr. Toksoz said."
"The governor of this remote region in southeastern Turkey says that he is not to blame for the scores of rickety buildings that collapsed in an earthquake on Thursday. But the mayor's office does fault the governor's office for not doing enough to prevent shoddy public buildings from going up. ''Turkey still doesn't take earthquakes seriously,'' Deputy Mayor Seuket Turan said today. A city building inspector blames corrupt contractors who have made shoddy deals with politicians. The many victims, forced out of their damaged homes by the thousands, say they are not sure who is most responsible. But they are angry. Every time the earth trembles along one of Turkey's fault lines, there is fierce finger-pointing that exposes the deep fissures in Turkish society. But only a modest amount seems to be done to help the country better withstand the next quake. ''Usually, there is a four- to five-month-long wave of excitement after an earthquake but then everything goes back to normal,'' said Tugrul Tankut, director of Turkey's National Earthquake Council. ''The government may make statements to cash this into political profit but there needs to be solid progress to achieve lasting improvement.'' Turkish contractors pay off politicians to win building projects, which they then finish on the cheap. That was made clear in various assessments of the dual temblors in 1999 that leveled thousands of poorly constructed buildings and killed nearly 20,000 people. It is no surprise, critics here say, that most of the buildings destroyed in the latest quake, which had a magnitude of 6.4, were government-financed structures. Those damaged buildings included Bingol's city hall, the housing ministry and numerous school buildings, including the dormitory in the village of Celiksuyu that collapsed on 198 students. At least 68 youngsters perished in the dorm, and rescue workers continued to search today for 15 youths believed to be caught inside. The authorities said a federal prosecutor would visit the dormitory to study the wreckage and decide whether the contractor should face charges for not following safety regulations. ''If I had that contractor in front of me, I'd curse him,'' said Hatip Guner, a farmer who lost three relatives in the wreckage. Huseyin Cos, the governor, said he had just been on the job for a few months, appointed by the new federal government that took office in November. ''You can't expect me to know which buildings were built right,'' Mr. Cos said. ''I can't check every building in Turkey.'' He vowed to crack down on future construction. Fevz Berdibek, a member of the Turkish Parliament from Bingol, was himself accused of erecting shoddy structures, including a local high school. But Mr. Berdibek, an engineer, said that he had put up 40 buildings in the area and that most had nothing more than cracks in the walls from the latest earthquake. ''Many buildings here, not mine though, didn't meet the standards,'' Mr. Berdibek said. ''We need to do better.'' -------------------- Student Reported in Good Condition ISTANBUL, May 3 (AP) -- A boarding school student whose photograph on the front page of The New York Times on Friday showed him trapped in wreckage from the earthquake was reported in good condition today after being rescued and treated for minor injuries. ''I will buy you anything you want,'' the student, Mesut Gunala, 15, told the rescuer who pulled him out of the rubble, according to the Hurriyet newspaper. ''I will make lamb barbecue for you.''"
"Muhammad Iferki sprayed a stream of lemon air freshener through the window of an old ambulance today as rescue workers loaded yet another body into it to take to the hospital morgue. He had not slept since Wednesday night, when the twin apartment blocks where he lived crashed to the ground in a heap of rubble and dust, burying hundreds of people. This town was one of the worst-affected spots in the earthquake that killed more than 1,800 people when it hit the Algerian capital and nearby towns on Wednesday. ''I can rest but as soon as I shut my eyes the nightmares begin,'' said Mr. Iferki, 21, who was lying down in his mother's fourth-floor apartment when the quake struck on Wednesday night. ''Suddenly the world shook and from the window I saw the sea retreat 200 meters,'' he recalled. ''I thought for sure I was dead.'' His mother was not home, but he grabbed his 23-year-old cousin, who was visiting, and shielded her with his body. The ceiling fell in but somehow they survived, protected by a beam in part of the living room, which remained intact as the rest of the building collapsed. Here and in other affected cities the authorities raced to prevent the outbreak of epidemics as bodies stuck under the debris rotted in temperatures above 86 degrees. State radio said more than 7,650 people were injured and hundreds were missing after the 6.8-magnitude quake. Officials said the city of Boumerdes and nearby Reghaia were also among the areas worst-hit by the earthquake. Thousands slept outside overnight, worried that aftershocks could bring down buildings weakened by the earth's shudders. ''We don't know if the buildings are O.K.,'' Salah Aouras, who camped out with his six children near what was left of his home, was quoted by Reuters as saying. ''We need experts to come and tell us if we can go. We're still feeling the aftershocks and can't take the risk.'' Rescue teams with sniffer dogs, listening devices and heavy machinery searched through the rubble of buildings flattened by the quake. A 10-year-old girl was found today in Boumerdes by Polish and Austrian rescue workers, Agence France-Presse reported, quoting the Polish news agency PAP. Rescue workers said there was little hope of finding more people alive. The authorities, working to restore damaged telecommunications lines, power and water, said they would start destroying buildings too badly damaged to be inhabited. In Dellys, Mr. Iferki described what happened when the quake hit. ''I saw some light and a lot of dust and I tried to find a way out,'' he said, standing beside the vast mound of broken concrete that once formed 50 apartments. Mr. Iferki said he and his cousin managed to scramble out, somehow aided by other neighbors who heard their screams. Residents said that only two other people inside the block managed to escape and that rescue workers had pulled out an old woman and a baby alive, along with many bodies. No one at the scene could give an exact total for the victims here, but many people said one family was holding a wedding party at the time -- perhaps 60 guests, perhaps more -- who were inside, along with many residents. ''I was walking down the road beside the building and I fell over,'' said Rashid Chabli. ''I saw the dust rising from the fallen buildings but I had no idea what was going on. I mean I realized it was an earthquake, but . . .'' Words seemed to fail him when it came to describing such an apocalyptic scene. The flattened buildings here, which contained government housing rented cheaply to people in need, sat on a hillside above the Mediterranean Sea surrounded by other buildings that barely show any damage. ''The building just turned to powder,'' said Kamel Zirrouin, a local resident who wore a surgical mask to protect himself. ''The building materials were very bad quality -- people had only been living in there for a month and it was built in 2002.'' Residents of Boumerdes assailed President Abdelaziz Bouteflika with cries of ''assassin'' during his visit to the town today, journalists said. The president had come to greet foreign rescue workers but was forced to retreat to his car. As he drove away, angry people hurled stones at his car. Despite Algerians' natural caution about voicing criticism about the government, many people in the earthquake zone were openly critical of what they saw as the state's failure to provide enough help for the victims. In Dellys, a town of 30,000 some 60 miles east of Algiers, even some people involved in the rescue effort criticized the official response. Hundreds of volunteers tore away today at the rubble with shovels, picks and their bare hands in an attempt to find more survivors, but recovered only bodies. The telltale smell that signifies bad news rose from the holes the men punched into the concrete slabs entombing their neighbors. Teams of foreign rescue workers with sniffer dogs pondered how to help when so many people were scrambling over the vast site. The dogs are trained to detect human scent but they can only work effectively if the site is not contaminated by other people."
"Dr. Lowell S. Whiteside predicts that a moderate earthquake, possibly strong enough to rattle dishes, will shake Mammoth Lakes in California in a few days. ''Around the 15th of May,'' said Dr. Whiteside, chief forecaster for GeoForecaster Inc. of Lafayette, Calif. GeoForecaster says it has successfully forecast 16,520 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or larger in the last few years, including a rare magnitude 4.6 earthquake last month in Alabama. But Dr. Whiteside's forecasts did not include an earthquake in eastern Turkey two weeks ago that killed more than 150 people. ''That was a miss,'' he said. For other geologists, the assertions of successes are not convincing, either. GeoForecaster, they say, has yet to provide statistical evidence that its forecasts are better than random guessing. After many failures, most geologists say accurate forecasting remains far in the future. But a small revival in earthquake forecasting is occurring at the scientific fringes. GeoForecaster announced its forecasting services in February, and the subscription section of its Web site, geoforecaster.com, lists more than 120 quakes it expects globally in the next seven days, including small temblors today in the Northern Panhandle of Texas and on Thursday in northeastern Ohio. Next month or in July, another small California company, QuakeFinder of Palo Alto, plans to launch a satellite on a Russian rocket to look for low-frequency electromagnetic waves that may emanate from the ground before quakes. Dr. Whiteside said he was sure that the Mammoth Lakes quake would occur. Indeed, it may have already occurred. Under the GeoForecaster guidelines, a small magnitude 2.3 quake that wiggled Mammoth Lakes on Saturday already qualifies as a modestly successful fit to the forecast. But such a prediction is of no use to emergency planners. They are looking for accurate predictions, at least a few days ahead of time, of large deadly temblors. Last month, scientists reported that they had developed software that could detect the onset of an earthquake and sound a warning before a quake's most destructive shaking arrived, but that would provide only a few tens of seconds of warning at best. Some hopeful progress in prediction in the 1970's was followed by clear failures, predictions that did not come to pass and devastating earthquakes that struck without warning. Most scientists gave up. ''We finally decided what we needed to do is understand the physics of earthquakes,'' said Dr. John Filson, manager of the earthquake hazard program at the United States Geological Survey in Reston, Va. ''To understand what was going to happen, we needed to understand how it was going to happen.'' When the earth's sliding tectonic plates become stuck along an earthquake fault, stress builds up until the fault breaks, setting off a quake. Scientists can estimate the number and size of local aftershocks that can be expected after a large earthquake. The aftereffects can also be distant. To their surprise, seismologists observed that a quake in 1992 at Landers, Calif., in the Mojave Desert, set off seismic temblors more than 800 miles away, in Yellowstone National Park. This year, researchers led by Dr. John E. Vidale, a professor of geophysics at the University of California at Los Angeles, found that in addition to the redistribution of stress, the seismic shaking could damage nearby faults, perhaps making them more likely to rupture. The researchers have been tracking how the Landers fault is recovering from 1992 as rocks on the two sides of the fault become cemented together again. Their reports show that the fault noticeably weakened after the 1999 Hector Mine earthquake six miles away. Seismologists can also calculate how fault stresses shift after a quake, indicating what other faults may be likely to give way next. Since 1939, the North Anatolian fault in northern Turkey has ruptured, east to west, in a series of magnitude 7.0 and larger quakes, most recently a magnitude 7.4 in 1999 that killed 17,000 people. If the westward procession continues, the next major temblor will devastate Istanbul. But all of this information is insufficient to zero in on the when and where of the next big quake. Geophysicists had hoped that a weakening fault might give telltale warning signs. They even had one resounding success. In 1975, the Chinese authorities ordered the removal of the one million residents of Haicheng because of an ominous series of small earthquakes, changes in ground water levels and strange behavior by animals. A few days after the removal, a magnitude 7.3 quake flattened Haicheng. The next year, however, no such warning signs preceded a magnitude 8.0 earthquake in Tangshan, China, killing hundreds of thousands of people. The Haicheng success has not been repeated. In the 1980's came the Parkfield prediction. In Parkfield along the San Andreas fault in central California, moderate earthquakes seemed to strike fairly regularly, in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934 and 1966. In 1985, scientists from the Geological Survey theorized that Parkfield was due and announced that they were 95 percent sure that a moderate-size quake, about magnitude 6.0, would occur there by the end of 1993, and they installed a barrage of instruments to observe it. The instruments remain in place and operating. The quake has not occurred. ''I don't feel embarrassed by it,'' Dr. Filson said. ''You try and test a hypothesis. It was an honest, open public experiment.'' A few years later, the agency dispersed the $15 million a year that it had been spending on earthquake prediction to other research, Dr. Filson said. Dr. Whiteside said he had followed research on quake forecasting for three decades. In his thesis research at the University of Colorado, completed in 1999, he looked for statistical correlations between quakes and phenomena like other quakes, hurricanes and even sunspots. He said he found patterns. ''We had a series of types of phenomena which were related somehow,'' Dr. Whiteside said, ''even if we didn't know exactly how.'' A thesis adviser, Dr. Roger Bilham, said that Dr. Whiteside had plotted the distance and time of all earthquakes after one earthquake and found straight lines in his graphs that indicated waves of new earthquakes propagating from the epicenter. ''These lines should just not be there,'' Dr. Bilham said. ''Somehow there is some strain adjustment propagating out from the earthquake.'' Officials at GeoForecaster will not disclose their methods, saying the information is proprietary. Dr. Whiteside said they were based in part on his thesis work, but also pulled in other research. While GeoForecaster's exact methodology remains secret, it sells forecasts to the public, $9.95 a month for local seven-day forecasts and $240 a month for the global 30-day forecasts. Dr. Whiteside and Dr. Michael Kozuch, president of GeoForecaster, said they decided to start a commercial venture, because they thought that forecasting research would not garner research grants and that academic journals would not publish their findings. Other geologists are doubtful that the predictions are any better than guessing. For example, Dr. Whiteside's forecast of a quake in the Mammoth Lakes region, 200 miles east of San Francisco near the Nevada border, will certainly come true, to some extent. Several imperceptible magnitude 1.0 and magnitude 2.0 occur there every day, and magnitude 3.0 earthquakes are not rare. ''They may be shooting fish in a barrel,'' said Dr. Susan E. Hough, a geophysicist at the Geological Service in Pasadena, Calif. Scientists have also complained that GeoForecaster is overly generous with its self-grading. GeoForecaster did not exactly predict the magnitude 4.6 quake on April 30 in Alabama. The company forecast was for a magnitude 3.0 earthquake in Tennessee 125 miles north the next week. On the Web site that day, Dr. Whiteside still claimed success. ''The relationship between today's event and this forecast is probably not coincidental,'' he wrote, ''but should suggest that the techniques GeoForecaster uses led to some advance knowledge, however imperfect, that the seismic hazard of the area had increased at this time.'' To judge the results fairly, scientists would need to compare the forecasts with randomly generated ones. GeoForecaster has not performed such comparisons. Dr. Kozuch said he was working to have outside experts conduct that test. ''The way these people are doing it is a bit odd,'' Dr. Bilham said. ''But I think they should be given a fair chance.'' Dr. John E. Ebel, a professor of geophysics at Boston College, is also issuing quake forecasts, but on a much smaller scale, based simply on the observation that after earthquakes of 2.7 magnitude or larger in New England, there was a one in five chance of another quake elsewhere in New England the next week. For a magnitude 3.5 temblor, the chances of another event rise to one in three. If quakes were completely random, there chance of a follow-up quake the next week should be one in 10. ''We are, I think, 0 for 2,'' Dr. Ebel said. ''From a scientific point of view, it's interesting. From a public point of view, it's not so interesting, so far.'' Other people continue to look for other phenomena that can act as warning signals. The $1 million satellite that QuakeFinder is launching is designed to detect low-frequency electromagnetic waves, from 1 to 1,000 hertz. In 1989, instruments set up by Dr. Antony C. Fraser-Smith, a professor of electrical engineering and geophysics at Stanford, detected such emissions rising before the Loma Prieta quake and persisting for weeks after. Also in 1989, a Russian satellite and a French satellite appeared to record similar signals from other quakes. ''Certainly, the data from those two satellites were tantalizing,'' said Tom Bleier, technology officer of QuakeFinder. It does not appear to be a universal phenomenon. Measurements after the 1999 Hector Mine quake found no emissions. Mr. Bleier said the satellite, which is designed to last six month to a year, should be able to observe whether that is common among large quakes. ''We are really in the data gathering mode,'' he said. ''We're not claiming to be able to predict earthquakes.''"
"As the death toll from the earthquake that struck Algeria on Wednesday rose above 2,000 today, shock and grief were being replaced by rage at the authorities over shoddy buildings that killed so many and inadequate rescue efforts for those who survived. The Interior Ministry said today that at least 2,162 people had been killed in the quake and more than 8,000 injured, though the death toll was expected to rise even higher. About 1,000 people are still listed as missing. Thousands of families are homeless, many towns are without water or electricity and the distribution of aid is patchy at best, survivors say. Hardest to bear as the days pass is the sense that those who were trapped alive by the quake died because there was no way to pull them promptly from their concrete tombs. In the town of Bordj Ménaïel, about 35 miles east of Algiers, Hamed Achour, an agricultural engineer, said Austrian search and rescue crews had arrived with dogs and found signs of life, but had no equipment to dig people out. ''It is all in Algiers, and they have not sent any machinery here,'' Mr. Achour said. ''Everything here, the rescue work, food, everything, has come from the people, the solidarity of the people,'' he added. The residents wanted saws for cutting concrete, drills and other specialized tools, but none were available. The effects of the quake were widely dispersed, with at least 50 miles of coastline affected, and the distribution of the destruction was telling. Survivors wondered why one building collapsed like a house of cards, when others around it stood firm. Many blamed lax enforcement of building regulations and developers' greed. ''There is total anarchy within the housing sector, aggravated by an alarming level of corruption,'' Amar Tinicha, secretary of the National Union of Building Engineers, told the Algerian daily Liberté. ''We need laws and we need to apply them.'' Abdelhamid Boudaoud, president of an Algerian architectural organization, complained to the daily El Watan, ''Policy on urban planning in Algeria depends on quantity, not quality.'' He said stringent anti-earthquake rules adopted after a quake killed 3,000 people in 1980 in the province of Chlef were rarely applied. The lack of rescue equipment available to cope with the quake was sharply felt in Bordj Ménaïel on Saturday when three dogs handled by a team of Austrian volunteers indicated that they had found a survivor. A man identified by neighbors as Ramdane Zannum was apparently still alive, trapped in the rubble of the second-floor hammam, or public bath, where he worked. The Austrians, who had no digging gear, summoned a Swedish team that was equipped with microphones, a camera and drills, to try to pinpoint the area. But there was no miracle: the microphone was silent, and when the Austrian dogs went back in, their barks were quieter. ''The intensity of the scent is decreasing, so maybe it's a dead person and the body is cooling,'' explained Leif Andren, who was leading a team from the Swedish Rescue Service Agency. ''While the body is warm it still smells as if it is alive,'' he said. Andreas Thurriedl, the leader of the Austrian team, said, ''At 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, we definitely thought there is someone in alive.'' But he added: ''I think we have tried everything we can. We have to make a decision.'' The decision was to pull out and wait for a new assignment, keeping in mind that the first 100 hours would soon be over, and after that, the rescuers said, it would be virtually impossible for anyone to have survived. Petra Jaensch, an Austrian, said her team had found four people alive in an apartment house. ''We don't know if they got out, because we had to move on to the next disaster,'' she said. Her colleague, Anita Truschnig, who worked in Turkey after the earthquake in 1999 that killed more than 17,000 people, said getting enough equipment to pull people out was always a big problem. ''There are so many houses that have fallen down, and there is no machinery,'' she said. The earthquake hit hard in towns with large populations of ethnic Berbers, where the lack of aid exacerbated long simmering tensions with the Arab-led government. Criticism in the Algerian press today included several demands that Prime Minister Abdelaziz Bouteflika resign. ''What is deplorable today,'' wrote Liberté in an editorial, ''is the authorities' incomprehensible inability to organize the rescue efforts with the determination and efficiency the situation requires.''"
"An overpowering smell of disinfectant stood guard at the entrance to Boumerdes Municipal Sports Hall as Ahmed Yebka came for his 23-year-old niece, Nora Bouali, armed with a plain wooden coffin. Her father, Muhammad Bouali, barely spoke, his dark eyes glittering with grief and disbelief. Nora's body, wrapped in a blanket, lay on the wooden floor of a basketball court transformed into a mortuary for more than 1,600 people killed in the shattering earthquake that rippled along Algeria's Mediterranean coast on Wednesday evening. ''I also lost my brother, his wife and their son,'' said Mr. Yebka, explaining that the first-floor home his relatives shared with Nora collapsed into a pile of rubble. ''We dug them out ourselves,'' he added. ''They were lying fallen by the front door, and the ceiling had just come in on top of them.'' As he spoke, an ambulance pulled up to the hall to deliver two more bodies to be laid out and photographed by forensic police for subsequent identification by relatives. Workers at the hall had already taken delivery of 435 bodies, all but three of them claimed, but they feared many more were still to come. Algerian journalists based in this seaside town of 120,000 people say the toll in Boumerdes, one of the towns worst hit by the quake, stands at 835 dead, with 1,222 missing and 3,422 wounded. The Algerian government put the national death toll from the 6.8-magnitude quake at more than 1,600 people and the number of injured at more than 7,000. At least eight people had been pulled alive from their dust-filled tombs in Boumerdes, local news media reported, but mostly the rescuers found corpses. There was one happy ending today. Emilie Kaidi, 2, was freed from the rubble of her family's crushed apartment, apparently unscathed, The Associated Press reported. Policemen, firemen, civilian officials and the army were all working 24 hours a day, but the rescue efforts seemed chaotic, if well-meaning. Today hundreds of men clambered over mountains of rubble, searching for survivors among the debris of so many ruined lives: a television set, screen intact, a rusty washing machine, cups and saucers, a doll, shoes, a remote control. Spectators making the most of a cloudless afternoon, a day of rest here, stood watching as others swung sledgehammers against the concrete floors that lay compressed, hoping to open a hole and find someone. Men squirmed into the narrowest of gaps seeking signs of life. But their efforts inadvertently hampered the work of the professionals, foreign rescue crews using sniffer dogs, and at least one team gave up and moved on to a less crowded location. There, a handsome Weimaraner trotting up and down and into the mounds of brick and concrete began to bark, a sign that he had found something or someone. But a black sheepdog sent in to double-check drew a blank, and without a clear indication of where this person might be, there was little the crew could do. A group of women and children, fearful of looters, sat beside the remains of one four-story apartment block guarding the few possessions they had managed to salvage from their top-floor apartment -- wooden doors, a table, a blue tricycle. ''I did not lose anyone, but I'm in shock, great shock. I will never forget this,'' said a young woman who would only give her name as Ouisa. Several of the neighbors who lived below her apartment were dead: those who lived on the top floor escaped with a fright, those who lived below were crushed. Now, she said, ''we are all sleeping in the street.'' Some families have moved into a small park in Boumerdes, constructing makeshift tents from beach umbrellas, sheets and blankets. The three-lane highway from Algiers to Boumerdes, some 40 miles east of the capital, was jammed on Friday by a cavalcade of onlookers and well-wishers, cars and trucks filled with blankets, or baguettes, or bottles of water, slowing traffic to a 10-mile-an-hour crawl. ''All the help we received has come from the people,'' said Ouisa. ''This was an act of God. But the government . . . they have done nothing.'' Many around the town complain that officialdom has yet to alleviate their pain. ''The cops are not doing anything to help and there are not enough resources,'' said Mehdi Halouane, bloodstained from his rescue efforts. ''There is nothing, nothing.'' Others say the government is party to the disaster for failing to enforce building codes. ''The state does not stop greedy private business people, the state should survey these buildings, but they take bribes and don't do anything,'' said Lies Boumeridja, a shopkeeper. ''They did not want to pay attention to safety -- the state has a responsibility.'' He noted that one building reduced to rubble in Boumerdes, where half-built apartment blocks rim the city, had been constructed only a year before, whereas a neighboring section still standing untouched was 10 years old. ''There is a God, so the poor people live -- those were houses for rich people,'' he added in reference to the ruined building. But many of the victims were anything but wealthy, especially in the capital. At El Aila, the largest cemetery in Algiers, burial ground of presidents and paupers, photographs of the victims, taken by police to aid in identification of the dead are on display. Sofian Dakha, who works for a construction company, came looking for two Chinese colleagues missing since the quake. They did not appear to be among the battered and bloody faces with sightless eyes, too many of them children. A baby wrapped in a blanket was buried in El Aila at one of around 60 funerals held in bright sunshine after Friday prayers. In Boumerdes today, several bodies lay shrouded in the sports hall awaiting the recovery of other close relatives so that all family members could be laid to rest together. Mr. Yebka was back for the last time: ''We have three buried and now we have come for my niece,'' he said. ''We will never forget this catastrophe.''"
"Earthquakes come with much of the territory in California, a cautionary consideration for living here, like hurricanes in the South, tornadoes in the Midwest and, for now anyway, the Mets in Queens. The state is laced with hundreds of fault lines, some considered unstable enough to produce the next Big One. For the most part, though, Californians are a hardy bunch, willing to choose geographic splendor and pleasant weather over the threat of any old earthquake. That includes the entire population of Parkfield, all 18 of them. For scientists, Parkfield is the earthquake capital of the world, a sleepy patch of barley fields and low mountains near the midpoint of the biggest fault in California, the San Andreas. Stretching northwestward from the Mexican border, the San Andreas Fault has accounted for at least four of the biggest earthquakes to rattle the state, including the one in 1906 that destroyed much of San Francisco. That quake would have registered a magnitude of nearly 8, had the current scale been available then. Quakes of magnitude 6 or more have shaken Parkfield on such a regular basis -- in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934 and 1966 -- that scientists have turned this part of the fault into a geologic laboratory, with the highest concentration of seismic monitoring devices anywhere, producing data that is shared by governments and universities all over the world. The United States Geological Survey even has a full-time scientist here, an affable Montanan named Andy Snyder, who spends much of his day tending to all the gizmos that measure movement along the tectonic plates -- the Pacific on one side of the fault, the North American on the other. The plates move about a half-inch a year, which doesn't sound like much until you see the 70-year-old bridge on the south side of town that straddles the fault. It's bent. To the locals, the array of equipment and worldwide expectations that the next big quake is years overdue have become something of a badge of honor. The town has a marketing slogan, ''Be here when it happens,'' and the few local businesses take full advantage. A sign nailed to a post on Oak Street points the way to a farmer selling ''quakey, shakey eggs.'' The menu at the Parkfield Cafe has entrees that include the Big One, a one-pound sirloin; the Magnitude 6, a 12-ounce sirloin; and desserts listed under ''Aftershocks.'' But among the people who live here, earthquake fears register a magnitude of little more than 0. ''I wouldn't want to live anywhere else,'' said Donalee Thomason, 78, Parkfield's matriarch and local historian, whose family has been ranching in the area for nearly 100 years. About the last time she could remember anyone here being truly frightened, she said, was during the 1934 quake, when she was caught in the town's one-room schoolhouse and everything was moving. ''Kids were getting thrown against the back wall, but it was the adults doing all the screaming, trying to get out,'' Mrs. Thomason said. No one, she pointed out, was injured. ''Now, in 1966, we had one man broke his toe. Running around the house, he crashed into a pile of bricks.'' She laughed at the memory. ''We're about due for another big one,'' she said, ''but it doesn't bother me. What good does it do to worry about it?'' Much of the town's confidence derives from the size and sparseness of its buildings. Nearly all are one story. Ranches are well spread out, and downtown is not much to speak of, just the cafe and a six-room inn across the street, both owned by John Varian and his family. The railroad cars that used to house a gift shop closed years ago. Mr. Varian, 39, whose family also owns a ranch that crosses the San Andreas, lives behind the inn in a small house with his wife, Barbara, their three children, two dogs and a pet calf named Cassie, who hangs out with the dogs. He sees only an upside to earthquakes. Back in 1985, he recalled, the Geological Survey predicted that one was due in the Parkfield cycle. That quake never came, but scores of scientists and curiosity seekers did, filling the inn and keeping the cafe's kitchen open late. As a schoolboy, Mr. Varian said, he had been instructed to crawl under his desk in the event of a quake, but no one took the threat too seriously. Town residents still don't, he said, figuring that the damage in Parkfield would never compare with the potential death and destruction of a big-city quake, like those that struck near San Francisco in 1989 and Los Angeles in 1994. Over at the cafe, Bonnie Speer, the manager and head cook, said she had never experienced a moment of apprehension in her 22 years in Parkfield. ''You've got to live somewhere.'' Ms. Speer said. ''And in a quake, I'd rather be here than Los Angeles. It's also why I never moved to San Francisco, with all those big buildings.'' Mr. Varian has grown so enamored of Parkfield, 50 miles from the ocean, that he is building a larger house up the hill behind the cafe -- on a site closer to the San Andreas. ''If I lived in a big city, I might have a little more concern,'' he said. ''But I look at it this way: 30 million years from now, I'll have beachfront property.'' Parkfield Journal"
"A powerful earthquake leveled buildings over a wide swath of southeastern Turkey today, killing at least 100 people and injuring many hundreds more. In the town of Bingol, where the earthquake was strongest, a boarding school collapsed with 198 students sleeping inside. The bodies of 14 children and a teacher were recovered, but more than 90 children had been hauled out alive from the wreckage of concrete and steel by day's end, the Turkish authorities said. Rescue teams using cranes and jackhammers worked into the night in an effort to recover another 90 or so pupils still trapped underneath. Emergency workers gave water to eight students they found trapped in the debris late tonight, but they were unable to extract them immediately. ''They were all caught in their beds,'' said Muhsin Balci, a rescue worker who arrived hours after the quake at the Celtiksuyu Boarding School, whose students are ages 7 to 16. He told local television that he could hear cries from the wreckage as he began pulling panicked students to safety in the dark. ''I hope we can rescue another 50 of them,'' he said. As workers dug through the rubble today, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the scene, hundreds of miles east of Turkey's major cities, Ankara and Istanbul. The prime minister criticized the quality of the school's construction and vowed to hold responsible those who built it in what he said was a shoddy manner as well as the people who failed to inspect it. Officials said the dormitory was built several years ago. Relatives of children caught in the wreckage converged at the chaotic scene, straining for a glimpse of the bodies that were being carried away. Mattresses were laid out to treat injured students not far from the flattened four-story building. Security officers struggled to contain anguished relatives who were pressing to get close to the school. Many of the trapped students came from poor Kurdish farming families in outlying areas that lack schools. The students slept at the dormitory in Bingol because it was the only way to make it to class. ''Everybody was expecting to have live students being brought out, which has happened in the past six, seven hours, but now it seems like the chances of live students being brought out are slowly diminishing,'' a local journalist at the scene, Gokhan Eren, told CNN. One of those hauled from the wreckage, a young boy, recounted his ordeal on Turkish television from a stretcher on the ground outside Bingol's hospital. ''We yelled 'Save us from here,' '' he said. ''They tried all day long, and pulled us out. We were on the first floor.'' The quake, with a magnitude of 6.4, struck at 3:27 a.m. The fierce shaking lasted about 17 seconds, followed by hundreds of aftershocks. Scores of houses and a major bridge were destroyed in the mountainous region. ''It is impossible to describe the feeling,'' said Yilmaz Ates, who fled from his house in Bingol after the quake and headed to the hospital to determine whether any friends or relatives were there. ''There are so many injured and dead, it is just terrible. I wouldn't even imagine sleeping indoors tonight.'' The authorities urged the public to remain calm, but with the ground beneath them continuing to shake throughout the day, they also told residents to stay away from damaged structures. ''As the quake is massive, its aftershocks will also be massive,'' Gulay Barbarosoglu, head of the seismology institute at Bogazici University in Istanbul, told the state-run Anatolian Agency. ''Damaged houses should not be used.'' The death toll recorded so far was spread widely throughout the country's southeast. The authorities said tonight that 50 people died and 370 were injured in Bingol Province. Mr. Erdogan, whose Justice and Development Party came to power in elections last November, sought to gain control of the crisis. ''Investigations will be launched and the guilty will be prosecuted,'' Mr. Erdogan said. Some parents with students in the destroyed school wasted no time in filing a lawsuit against the builders of the dormitory. Meanwhile, the Education Ministry ordered immediate inspections of all schools in the Bingol area. In 1999, when two large earthquakes hit western Turkey, thousands of poorly made buildings collapsed, killing some 18,000 people. Turkey has two major seismic fault lines that run from southeastern Anatolia toward the country's northwest. Bingol has been struck before, in 1971, when an earthquake killed almost 900 people in the area, the authorities said. The hospital in Bingol was damaged, prompting doctors to treat scores of injured people in a tent set up in the garden. ''We need every kind of help,'' Ilhan Cokabay, the hospital's chief doctor, told The Associated Press. ''Medical supplies, people, whatever.'' The earthquake also damaged power and telephone lines in the area. At this time of year, evenings are still cold in southeast Turkey. The Turkish Red Crescent and local governments sent thousands of blankets as well as tents, ambulances and other relief supplies to the region. Greece, another country hard hit by earthquakes, was the first to offer international help. Although relations between the countries improved after they came to each others' aid after quakes struck both countries in 1999, Turkish officials did not immediately accept the outside aid. Still, local officials were calling for assistance, with tents a particularly pressing need. ''Many will have to spend the night on the streets because they cannot enter their buildings,'' Bingol's mayor, Feyzullah Karaaslan, told The Associated Press."
"New computer software can detect the onset of an earthquake and sound a warning before a quake's most destructive shaking arrives, scientists are reporting today. If the system is put into effect, the warning will be short -- tens of seconds at most -- but it may give workers and students time to duck under desks, air traffic controllers the chance to wave off landing planes and officers a few seconds to lower barriers to keep cars off bridges and overpasses. For now, though, experts are unsure just how they will use the warnings and acknowledge that false alarms may create problems. ''Just ringing a bell can cause a lot of panic,'' said Dr. Richard M. Allen, a professor of geology and geophysics at the University of Wisconsin. Writing in today's issue of the journal Science, Dr. Allen and Dr. Hiroo Kanamori, a professor of geophysics at the California Institute of Technology, describe a computer algorithm that analyzes seismic data gathered from 150 sensors already deployed around Southern California and continuously sent to a computer at Caltech. Similar systems could also be put in place in other earthquake-prone areas. Dr. Allen said that he and Dr. Kanamori were currently researching whether a sparser and less expensive network of sensors would still provide useful warning. ''If we can do that, we can go to the regions that don't have the resources,'' Dr. Allen said. ''I would argue these kinds of systems could be very useful in places like Turkey.'' Earthquakes shake rocks in two different ways. The warning system focuses on one type of seismic wave that moves quickly -- 3.5 miles a second -- but causes little damage, resembling the waves that travel along a Slinky toy when one end is pushed and pulled quickly. The slower, more destructive waves resemble the waves when a Slinky is shaken side to side. The computer program, running on the computer at Caltech, detects the onset of an earthquake in the faster-moving seismic waves, and within seconds, calculates the epicenter and estimates the magnitude. A warning can then be issued. A location 35 miles from the epicenter will get about a 15-second warning before the slower, damaging seismic waves arrive. The technology appears to be arriving before emergency officials have had time to think through how warnings should be issued and who should receive them. Also unresolved are questions like who would issue the warnings. ''When you start thinking about the next step, it really is a quagmire,'' said Dr. David Wald, a seismologist with the United States Geological Survey. ''Most people don't know what to do with that information. We're not ready for it.'' The researchers are considering a system that will send out the warnings via the Internet. Patrick Small, the computer programmer installing Dr. Allen and Dr. Kanamori's algorithms, said he hoped to finish a prototype of software by the end of the summer that would run on personal computers and receive and display earthquake warnings from the Caltech computer. Mr. Small is also working to speed up his computer program. Zooming in on the epicenter now takes 15 to 40 seconds. ''I think we can get it down to about 5 seconds,'' he said. The researchers will begin an internal test phase to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the warnings. ''What I'm working on is definitely not for the public,'' Mr. Small said, meaning that it is not ready for practical use. While the technology is unfinished but progressing quickly, the policy decisions have hardly begun. ''We've thought about it,'' said Dr. John Filson, manager of the earthquake hazard program at the Geological Survey. ''And it's a difficult issue. To turn it into an operational system is going to take some thoughtful planning with the local emergency response officials.'' At first, the warnings may be most easily used in controlled environments like schools and hospitals, where false alarms would probably not be more than a nuisance. ''We could possibly avoid injuries in our schools by training our children to get beneath their desks and away from the windows,'' said James Goltz, a research specialist in California's Office of Emergency Services. It would eventually be possible to design ''smart'' buildings that upon receiving a warning could take actions like moving elevators to the nearest floor and opening the doors to prevent people from being trapped. Mr. Goltz said he thought that if an agency started issuing earthquake warnings, it would be hard to restrict that information to a limited group of people. ''I think as this technology become available, we do have an obligation to promote its availability to groups that can use it, everyone ultimately,'' he said. Earthquake warning systems already exist in a few areas, including Mexico City. There, the system is simpler, because the earthquake originates from faults nearly 200 miles to the southwest of the city and seismometers can easily detect the rumblings before they reach Mexico City. The system has generated some false alarms. In the Los Angeles area, faults crisscross through the populated areas. Even with a fully functioning system, people at the epicenter would receive almost no warning. ''Early warning is not a panacea for earthquake losses,'' said Dr. Wald of the Geological Survey."
"More than just buildings collapsed in the earthquake that shook the central Mediterranean coast of this country a week ago. Public confidence in a government plagued by mismanagement and corruption collapsed, too. President Abdelazziz Bouteflika has called for an official inquiry into why so many relatively new apartment buildings crumpled in the May 21 earthquake, killing more than 2,200 people and injuring at least 10,000. Strong aftershocks have continued to rattle nerves this week, with three people killed on Tuesday. But the destruction is clearly linked to shoddy construction materials and the building of homes on unstable soil in a region prone to seismic activity. ''Here's a gift from the Algerian government,'' said Djenadi Zoubida, 40, planting a chunk of crumbly gray concrete into a reporter's hand outside the wrecked second-floor apartment. A group of men around him in this small town, 10 miles east of the capital, chimed in with visible anger. ''The state is completely absent,'' said one white-haired man who declined to give his name. The military-backed government's responsibility in the disaster has accelerated what until now was a slow-motion political crisis that began more than a decade ago when the Algerian military canceled elections that risked putting an Islamist party in power. The earthquake has crystallized public anger that has long been brewing over government ineptitude in a country where, despite generous reserves of oil and gas, millions of people live on just a dollar a day and at least a third of the work force is unemployed. Without a viable opposition, however, there is little hope of real change, politicians say. The military's intervention gave rise to terrorism that was blamed on Islamic militants. But the army's iron-fisted response eliminated any effective political opposition. Meanwhile, the government's responsibility in a series of natural disasters have sapped public confidence in the political system. Mr. Zoubida said his first home was swept away in a flash flood two years ago when water from torrential rains cascaded through Algiers' streets instead of its sewers, which the army had blocked to impede the movement of terrorists. The state gave Mr. Zoubida his new home here, but now the confluence of government mismanagement and natural disaster has left him homeless again. Previous earthquakes have also laid bare the shortcomings in the government's supervision of construction practices. On Sunday, during a visit to the area most damaged by the earthquake, about 30 miles east of here, Mr. Bouteflika was shouted down and some cars in his entourage were kicked by enraged residents. Since then, some newspapers have called for his resignation, while others have derided him for his preoccupation with the presidential election next year. ''The state never came to inspect anything,'' said Dellachi Hocine, unshaven for days and standing before a tent erected in front of a damaged four-story concrete-and-clay brick building here. Another man said, ''Either the government didn't spend enough money or it didn't control the private developers who had contracted to do the construction.'' Many of the buildings destroyed in the earthquake were recently constructed public housing. Architects and engineers maintain that for years there has been no real enforcement of laws designed to ensure buildings are reasonably earthquake-proof in an area where major quakes hit roughly every 20 years. ''There is no culture of listening in this government,'' said Abdelhamid Boudaoud, president of Algeria's national college of architectural experts. He flipped through a 500-page report on preparing buildings for natural disasters that his organization issued after a conference in March. The document was sent to Mr. Bouteflika and government ministers but Mr. Boudaoud said there was no response. He said architects and engineers are paid primarily for their signatures, used to secure building permits and bank loans, but that their recommendations are routinely ignored. Among the changes he and his colleagues have called for is a requirement that developers have a qualified expert on site to oversee construction. ''Some builders can't even read a building plan,'' Mr. Boudaoud said. It is not the first time the country's architects have tried to warn of impending disaster: Mr. Boudaoud opened thick reports filled with similar recommendations made after other conferences that his school has helped organize annually for the last 10 years. Many people blame the problems on a political system that has allowed corruption to flourish and criminal neglect to go unpunished. Previous government inquiries into scandals and disasters have ended without action, they say. There is little hope of real change, they complain, without political reform that will allow opposition parties to gain a voice. The army has said publicly that, with the terrorist threat now under control, it will approve any candidate who wins next year's presidential election, which is critical because of the power concentrated in the executive branch. That pledge has raised hopes that the military will not put forward its own candidate, as it did with Mr. Bouteflika in 1999. There is also new hope that changes can be made to the country's electoral laws, which give the military the means to manipulate elections. For example, the country's uniformed services, including the army and police, vote in their barracks a day early and then hold the ballots until three days after the general election. To protest those rules, the country's opposition parties boycotted the last presidential elections in 1999, leaving Mr. Bouteflika the sole candidate and a certain victor. In Boumerdes, near the epicenter of last week's earthquake, several opposition parties have set up centers in response to what many charge was a sluggish official reaction to the disaster. ''When the state didn't respond, we established this crisis center,'' said Laski Ali, a local leader of the Front for Socialist Forces, or F.F.S., the country's largest opposition party. The centers are operating despite a government ban on the distribution of aid by anyone other than the Interior Ministry or the Red Crescent, a ban intended to prevent opposition parties from profiting politically from the disaster. ''There is no longer any confidence in this government,'' he added. The country's fractured opposition, split among half a dozen parties that attack each other as much as the government in power, recognizes that the earthquake presents them with a rare opportunity to capitalize on public anger before next year's elections. But it has yet to present any credible program for wresting power from the National Liberation Front, the ruling party. Several rubble-strewn blocks away from the F.F.S. crisis center, members of the country's largest legal Islamist party, the Social Movement for Peace, expressed their frustration with the situation. ''I don't think the existing power is ready for change and I don't think the opposition is ready to unite to force a change,'' said Dahmen Abdelkrim, a party official. ''It would require a united front against the status quo.''"
"Wednesday's deadly earthquake in Algeria occurred in a seismically active region that stretches from Portugal to Sicily. The magnitude 6.8 earthquake, which struck at 7:44 p.m. (2:44 p.m. E.D.T.), was the strongest in more than two decades. The United States Geological Survey placed the origin of the earthquake six miles underground about 45 miles east of Algiers. At that spot the African tectonic plate is moving almost a quarter inch a year to the north-northwest, pushing up against the Eurasian plate. ''Northern Algeria is right along the plate boundary between Africa and Europe,'' said Dr. Mustapha Meghraoui, a geophysicist at the Institute of Physics of the Earth in Strasbourg, France. ''This activity is not a surprise.'' As the rocks along the boundary are squeezed together, energy and stress build up until one side of a fault pops up, unleashing an earthquake. Dr. Meghraoui estimated that in Wednesday's earthquake 9 to 12 miles of the fault slipped about a yard. Many aftershocks have followed, including at least three of magnitude 5.0 or stronger. Because it is prone to moderate-to-large earthquakes, Algeria has strict building codes, Dr. Meghraoui said. But, he added, ''Private construction doesn't comply with the code. The damage is always due to the bad construction rather than the intensity of the earthquake.'' Several other catastrophic earthquakes have occurred along the same fault system in Algeria. More than 1,000 people died in a magnitude 6.7 earthquake in 1954 in Orleansville, 100 miles to the southwest of Algiers. In 1980 the same city, renamed El Asnam after Algeria won independence from France, was devastated by a magnitude 7.1 earthquake that killed more than 2,500 people."
"A powerful earthquake struck northern Japan today, injuring at least 78 people, starting fires and damaging buildings throughout the region. The earthquake, reported to have a magnitude of 7.0, caused no fatalities, but frightened many, and disrupted services in a broad swath of northern Japan. The Tohoku Electric Power Company said an 825,000-kilowatt nuclear reactor, its Onagawa No. 3 unit, which is situated near the epicenter in northern Japan, automatically shut down. Of those hurt, 49 were injured in landslides. The temblor, which was the strongest earthquake to hit Japan in two years, was powerful enough to be strongly felt 280 miles away, in Tokyo, where tall buildings were shaken for several minutes, street lamps swayed and elevators in some buildings ceased operating when the seismic activity began, at 6:24 p.m. The prime minister of Norway, Kjell Magne Bondevik, who was on a state visit to Japan, was evacuated from his Tokyo hotel room. ''First I ran out in the corridor without my shoes, but then I decided it was best to put them on,'' Mr. Bondevik told Norwegian television. In northern Japan, about 35,000 homes temporarily lost power, but electricity was quickly restored for most customers. Rail service throughout the region was also temporarily suspended, and amid the panic, telephone networks were briefly overwhelmed. Experts said the earthquake's power was muted by the location of its epicenter, which was not only 20 miles offshore Miyagi prefecture, on the northeastern Pacific coast, but 40 miles beneath the earth's surface. The depth of the seismic activity also eliminated the risk of tsunamis, or huge sea waves. ''We assume that the earthquake occurred due to the sliding down of the Pacific Plate,'' Noritake Nishibe, head of the meteorological agency's earthquake monitoring section, told reporters. Japan is one of the most seismically active countries in the world, and scientists attribute much of the activity to movements of two tectonic places -- the Pacific Plate and the Philippines Plate -- which are vast pieces of the earth's crust. Japan's last major earthquake was in Kobe in 1995. That tremor, which measured 7.2, killed more than 6,000 people."
"Q. What causes the noises you hear in an earthquake? A. The sliding of rocks past one another along a fault causes vibrations. In the rocks themselves, these vibrations are called seismic waves. When they reach the surface of the earth, the waves can be transmitted into the air, where they become sound, explained Dr. Bill Menke, chairman of the department of earth and environmental science at Columbia University. In a similar process, a violin emits a tone as the bow is drawn across the string. An important part of the process along slipping faults is that the sliding is jerky, as contrasted to, say, the quiet sliding of smooth, lubricated bearings. (A small fraction of an earthquake's sound energy is in the audible range; most is infrasound, too low in pitch for humans to hear.) As John Armbruster, a seismologist at the Earth Institute at Columbia, noted after a minor earthquake in Manhattan on Jan. 17, 2001, the rock noise can be very loud, and tends to be louder in East Coast quakes than in West Coast quakes. Many people who felt the Manhattan temblor thought that an explosion had occurred, he said, and it produced a sound much more impressive than the vibration that was felt. In the Eastern United States, he said, the rocks are old and strong and transmit the vibrations from the quake efficiently. The movement is a larger, more sudden jump. Thus, Mr. Armbruster said, the stronger Eastern rock can generate the same amount of energy or sound with a smaller source than a California quake from a larger source. Because the rocks there are younger and not as strong, earthquakes are felt at shorter distances and with less noise. C. CLAIBORNE RAY Q & A"
"Though the earthquake on Monday was felt from Los Angeles to San Francisco, its destructive epicenter was here in this small central California city where two women died, nearly 50 buildings were damaged, sulfur springs bubbled through the streets and the historic clock tower crumbled to the ground. The recovery of property continued today in the historic downtown decorated in ribbon and holiday lights. And as workers searched through the wreckage, the citizens were looking for something good to hold onto after the calamity that struck at the corner of Park and 12th Streets just before Christmas. The meaning of it all for residents seemed to vacillate somewhere between appreciating what they still had and what they had lost, and less so on what they would receive on Christmas Day. One of the saddest places in town, surely, was up on the hill in the southern part town. Up there is a dream house on a hill, decorated for Christmas, a three car garage and an etched glass door still intact. Landscapers were laying sod and stone in the rain. A knock on the door was answered by a graying man with a mustache. ''Is this where Marilyn Zafuto lives?'' he was asked. ''Yes,'' he said, and then corrected himself. ''Well, it was.'' Mrs. Zafuto, 55, was killed by falling debris as she ran from a dress shop onto Park Street. A co-worker, Jennifer Myrick, 19, who was engaged to be married, died beside her. At the house on the hill, there were presents wrapped in pretty paper underneath the tree behind the man, some never to be opened by the intended recipient. The man shrugged his shoulders, his eyes welled up with tears and then he turned quietly around and locked the door behind him without identifying himself. In front of the house, one of the landscapers stood in the steady rain with the handle of the shovel underneath his chin. He said he was related to the Zafutos through a convoluted, small-town web of marriage and business arrangements. ''Not much of a Christmas for him is it,'' he said. ''It was a freak.'' Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger visited the destruction this morning and promised to visit the families of the dead. He signed a proclamation declaring San Luis Obispo County a disaster area and pledged that the state would help the county with all the resources at its disposal. As of this afternoon, there were no official local or statewide estimates of monetary damage, he said. Mr. Schwarzenegger said he and his wife, Maria Shriver, would pray for those who had died. ''We all share the pain for those who lost their lives,'' he told about 300 people who stood in the rain to hear him speak. He received warm applause. Paso Robles, with a population of about 25,000, is about halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles along U.S. 101 and was once a farming and resort town but has fallen on hard times. It has remade itself into a wine country destination, with boutiques and turn-of-the-century charm. Its residents proudly call it a small town, and remind visitors that it won the California Main Street Award just last year. As in other small towns across the United States, people here say neighbors are practically family, even in the good times. Early this morning, Christy Howland was helped by firefighters to retrieve her Christmas gifts from her crushed Chevrolet. Nick Sherwin, the man who cared for the clock tower that collapsed onto Park Street and who owned the jewelry store at its base, kept the twisted arms of the clock in his van. He will make it a gift to the building's owner, Mary Mastagni, in hope that it will make her feel better. Mr. Sherwin's wife, Patricia, and his daughter June Ellart, huddled around a cup of coffee underneath the awning of a miniature Christmas house in the town square wondering whether they would be allowed by the authorities to gather up the jewelry. The authorities said no. Inside their shop, the clocks stilled ticked. ''This isn't any Christmas present,'' Mrs. Ellart said glumly. Then her mother reminded her of her two children, her husband, her life. Mrs. Ellart perked up and remembered how lucky she was. ''I'm just excited to do flowered footprints on the carpet and go to church and remind my girls about the true meaning of Christmas,'' she said. ''We have that.'' Karen Arrambide, too, almost lost her life. The roof collapsed on her bakery and sandwich shop next to the Sherwins' jewelry store. She was trapped inside underneath heavy beams. ''I thought I was going to die,'' she said, attributing her luck to providence. What was left of her shop this morning was picked through by the birds. And the citizens of Paso Robles promised to rebuild."
"The mud brick fortress of Bam withstood the ravages of weather and conquering armies for 2,000 years, its soaring ramparts and crenelated citadel dominating western Persia in the ancient times when all east-west trade swayed along the caravan route known as the Silk Road. But it took only minutes for the architectural treasure -- the largest adobe structure of its kind in the world -- to come crashing down in great hunks during the ruinous earthquake three days ago. ''It's part of our life, our character, and when something like this is destroyed, you lose a little piece of your character as well,'' said Behzad Torkizadeh, a 39-year-old photographer from the equally famous city of Isfahan, who was among hundreds of volunteer relief workers coming to gape at the damage. With the initial shock of the violent quake easing slightly, Bam and its environs were beginning to take stock on Monday, embarking on the first tentative steps in the herculean cleanup and reconstruction tasks that will require years to complete. Officials at the Interior Ministry said the death toll stood at 25,000, or about one-quarter of the city's population, with thousands still missing. Residents begged the foreign teams still searching for survivors with dogs to help them unearth the dead, but the search and rescue teams had to explain patiently that the dogs were trained to sniff only for people who were alive. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and President Mohammad Khatami made separate visits to the city, both pledging to rebuild it to be better than before. Workers pushed wheelbarrows of cement rubble out of the damaged airport terminal and mopped its floor, while the manager of the Azadeh Hotel told guests that despite the waterlogged carpets, cracked walls and plasterwork hanging from the moldings, their rooms would be cleaned and would no longer be free. Earthmoving equipment was being trucked in to help clear the rubble once the search for the missing was officially declared over, while hundreds of residents piled mattresses, cupboards, bicycles and whatever household goods they had salvaged into small trucks and began to move out of the devastated city. ''We are not in a critical condition anymore,'' said Hussein Marash, a member of Parliament from Kerman Province. ''We have to start thinking about providing housing. We need to start reconstruction.'' There were signs of tension linked to the uneven distribution of aid. So many people mobbed a truck where tents were being given out that it started to drive off with the desperate still clinging to the tailgate. The health minister, Dr. Masoud Pezeshian, was surrounded by gesticulating medical staff members and agitated town residents when he left a hospital. Some questioned the lack of medical equipment for the city while others yelled about the flood of rescue workers who seemed to clog Bam. ''These are not rescue teams,'' one woman shouted. ''They are just young students, and they don't know anything!'' Theft also continued to be a problem; at one checkpoint, security guards fired a gun in the air to discourage young men on motorcycles from swerving off the highway out into the desert to avoid being stopped. The health minister said his main concern was preventing the spread of infectious diseases through people living outdoors and relying on perhaps unsanitary water. About 1,500 men and women from about 24 countries are here, but with hopes of finding more survivors largely gone, six teams told the United Nations offices coordinating the efforts that they would pull out Tuesday. Still, dozens of teams fanned out across the city, and Iranian officials said that two people were rescued Sunday and that there were sketchy details about an infant girl found in her mother's arms on Monday. The health minister said rescue teams had dug about 20 survivors out of the rubble in the past couple of days. Radik Svatos, a 28-year-old firefighter from Prague, said his team had found an elderly woman late Saturday in central Bam. Neighbors had heard knocking and got as far as exposing one shoulder. The Czech team got her out. Mr. Svatos said the woman was extremely lucky in that a pillar of bricks had collapsed on her refrigerator and because of her size -- she was less than 4 feet tall -- she had managed to stay alive in the kind of lean-to that was created. The mud brick construction most frequently used in Bam does not usually allow for that. ''I must say this is the worst I've ever seen, because of the construction,'' said Dr. Elizabeth Lipska with the Polish rescue team. ''Most of the buildings are destroyed, and the way they collapsed makes it impossible to survive.'' There was no one living in Bam's historic fortress, although its imposing citadel, as well as its roughly 120-foot high walls, encased 16th-century mosques, markets and other buildings. Along with the ruins of Persepolis and the main square in Isfahan, it was considered one of the major tourist draws in Iran. ''It might have been the most important,'' said Hamid Jalvani, another photographer, handing out postcards he had made showing the citadel lit up at night -- a fantasy fort of towers, moats and what seems like tiny archer's windows. What is left resembles a sand castle hit by a huge wave, the entire structure either melted or lying about in chunks of mud brick and straw. Mud brick domes cracked like eggshells, and only one row of crenelations remained intact. Not everyone mourned the building. One resident said the loss of even a historic building paled in comparison to the loss of life in the city. Relief workers dug down through the bricks in one office inside the fortress, pulling open tin trunks to rescue what one expert said were historic maps that could be used to reconstruct the monument. ''The main foundations are there, but it will require a long time and a lot of money,'' said Mohsen Movahedi, a researcher for the government department charged with rebuilding historic structures. On the airport road, one still intact sign reminded visitors that the Bam of old might never be quite the same. ''The biggest mud brick monument in the world awaits your revisit,'' it reads."
"On Thursday night, Adele Freedman and Tobb Dell'Oro called relatives in the United States and gushed about how they had been enchanted by the ancient Iranian city of Bam, family members said. They went to sleep that night at an inn in the city. Hours later, a powerful earthquake struck. The roof above them collapsed. They lay pinned under the rubble for four to six hours until their Iranian tour guide, racing to Bam from a nearby village, organized a rescue party to dig them out, said Ms. Freedman's mother, Annamae Freedman. Ms. Freedman, 39, survived, but Mr. Dell'Oro, 41, bled to death, the only American reported to have died in the quake that killed thousands of people. The couple had gone to Iran a week earlier, and on Christmas Eve, they decided to get married. On Monday, Ms. Freedman remained hospitalized in Tehran, her feet crushed in the collapse. Meanwhile, on Long Island, her mother and her father, Philip Freedman, made plans to fly to Iran to retrieve their daughter and tell her that Mr. Dell'Oro was dead. ''The doctors don't want her to know,'' Annamae Freedman said Monday. ''They're afraid she's going to go into shock. I'm going to hold her very close and tell her. We will tell her together.'' Ms. Freedman and Mr. Dell'Oro met at a party in California several years ago, family members said. Ms. Freedman, who grew up in Great Neck, is a partner at a northern California law firm, and Mr. Dell'Oro owned a market-research firm with his sister, Tam. They were avid travelers who explored Burma, Cambodia and Thailand, traveled to the South Pole and sought out obscure ethnic restaurants, family members said. They had gone to Iran to explore old cities and ''relive 1,001 Arabian nights,'' Annamae Freedman said. ''They loved to go to out-of-the-way places,'' Annamae Freedman said. ''That's why they were there.'' After spending some time in Europe and Dubai, the couple flew into Iran, and they had been traveling through Iran for a week, accompanied by a guide and driver, when the earthquake struck. Mr. Dell'Oro's sister, Tam, said the couple were struck by how they felt welcomed by the Iranians. On Monday, family members expressed a similar sentiment. They said they were astonished that Iranians in Bam would dig two American tourists from the rubble as other Iranians lay buried, and then rush the couple more than 100 miles to a hospital. Ms. Freedman's mother said the tour guide, Farzaneh Khademi, and others dug the couple out using their bare hands. A State Department spokesman confirmed that one American had died and one had been injured in the earthquake, but he would not confirm that they were Mr. Dell'Oro and Ms. Freedman. The couple were among the first people to be rescued from the rubble, Annamae Freedman said."
"At least two people were killed when a strong earthquake struck on Monday near this small central California town, causing a downtown building to collapse, knocking out power to thousands of people and swaying skyscrapers from Los Angeles to San Francisco. The authorities reported buckled roads, broken gas mains, ruptured water pipes, damaged buildings and several dozen injuries in towns across San Luis Obispo County, a rural region of vineyards and coastal mountains north of Los Angeles. The earthquake, which had a magnitude of 6.5, was the largest to strike California in more than four years. ''It was rocking and rolling,'' said Vince Morici, a county spokesman. ''Things were falling all over the place.'' Though there were no reports of injuries or damage in Los Angeles or San Francisco, the quake was felt across a wide stretch of coastal California, rattling nerves already on edge because of the heightened terrorism alert. Tina Halvorson, who works in a high-rise in Century City in Los Angeles, said she feared that a bomb had gone off in an underground parking garage. ''It felt like you were on a cruise ship, swaying back and forth,'' said Ms. Halvorson, a legal assistant who works in a law firm on the 34th floor. ''I tried to walk down the hallway and I really felt like I had vertigo.'' The only confirmed deaths and the worst reported damage occurred here in Paso Robles at the intersection of 12th and Park Streets, where the downtown's signature building, the Mastagni Building, crumbled into the street. The authorities said debris from the two-story building, which was capped by a 19th-century clock tower, killed two women on the sidewalk, Jennifer Myrick, 19, of Atascadero, and Marilyn Zafuto, 55, of Paso Robles. The police also searched for the occupants of three cars parked outside the building. About 45 other downtown buildings were damaged, most of them constructed from unreinforced masonry, the Paso Robles police said. ''It's really amazing we didn't have more damage with an epicenter as close as it was to these unreinforced masonry buildings,'' said Ron Alsop, emergency services coordinator for San Luis Obispo County. Late in the afternoon, Nick Sherwin, the owner of a jewelry shop in the Mastagni Building, was walking around downtown carrying the clock mechanism from the tower. Its hands became broken and twisted at 11:16 a.m., when the quake hit. Mr. Sherwin, 62, wearing a Christmas tie and an American flag pin, said he had maintained the clock for its owner. He said he and his wife, Patricia, were lucky to be alive. When the ground began to shake, about eight people were in his shop, Pan Jewelers, Mr. Sherwin said. He shouted, ''Run!'' Most everyone made it outside, but two elderly customers lost their footing and stumbled to the floor. Mr. Sherwin said he and Mrs. Sherwin then draped themselves over their customers and waited out the temblor. ''We've got a life,'' a relieved Mrs. Sherwin said. ''The heck with everything else.'' Not far away, at Kelly's Restaurant, there was also a rush for the exit. ''Everybody dropped to the floor and tried to get into the doorway,'' Kelly Case, the restaurant's owner, said by telephone shortly after the quake. ''The chandelier swung from one end of the ceiling to the other like a pendulum. You couldn't stand. You couldn't walk. It was surreal.'' The earthquake was centered northwest of here near San Simeon, a coastal town midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco and the site of Hearst Castle, a popular tourist attraction. Officials with the State Department of Parks and Recreation, which operates Hearst Castle, said about 500 visitors were evacuated after the earthquake but no one was hurt. The officials said that some items on display in the castle were damaged but that the building withstood the jolt. The authorities said officials at the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, about 30 miles south of the epicenter, declared an ''unusual event,'' which is the lowest of four emergency levels, but the plant was not damaged. ''Both units of the nuclear power plant operated normally, and they continue to operate,'' said Jeffrey Lewis, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric, whose office is in the plant. ''We are still finishing up what they call a walk-down to inspect secondary equipment, and so far we don't have any problems.'' The quake occurred on a little-understood fault zone that extends mostly underwater from the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco to Santa Barbara, seismologists said. The United States Geological Survey has not yet identified the precise fault, but scientists there said it was about 30 or 40 miles from the well-known San Andreas fault. William Ellsworth, chief scientist with the Geological Survey, said the San Andreas fault responded to the quake by moving slightly, probably a millimeter or two. ''The earthquake helped push it along,'' Mr. Ellsworth said. The seismologists described the damage as moderate and said it was fortunate that the quake was centered on a rural area. ''You put an earthquake like that under Los Angeles, and you have tens of billions of dollars in damage,'' said Dr. Ross Stein, a geophysicist with the Geological Survey, at a news conference. ''You put it out here in a relatively remote place, and fortunately there are not many immediate consequences.'' Dr. Stein said scientists were studying the quake and dozens of aftershocks for clues about seismic activity in California. ''The mountains have probably been pushed up a foot or so as a result of this earthquake,'' Dr. Stein said. ''Here we have basically a research earthquake. It's not occurred in a very densely populated area, but the kind of measurements we can get tell us what would happen if we put this earthquake, the same kind, in a populated area.'' Mark Buchman, a spokesman for the San Luis Obispo County Office of Emergency Services, said at least three gas leaks had been reported, including one in northern Santa Barbara County, about 65 miles south of the epicenter. ''There is some danger of fire, and it means we've had people responding to take care of them,'' Mr. Buchman said. ''The gas company has crews working on them.'' By late in the day, two Red Cross shelters had been set up, one in Morro Bay and the other in Oceana, said Mr. Alsop, the county emergency coordinator. ''In Morro Bay, we had some mobile homes shaken off their foundations, and in Oceana about 13 people are using shelter because a number of homes were damaged or fell off foundations,'' he said. In Paso Robles, the smell of sulfur permeated the night air, as old therapeutic sulfur springs, long ago capped, were apparently burst open by the shaking. People milled about the downtown, surveying the damage, swapping stories and counting their blessings. Rene Ellart, who had rushed downtown to check on the whereabouts of his wife, who was not harmed, said he was struck by the sight of so many motorists pulling off the road. The jiggling asphalt had felt like driving with a flat tire, he said. Ms. Case, the restaurant owner, took great comfort in the community spirit the earthquake seemed to have engendered. People walking and driving by, she said, shouted, honked or simply gave a thumbs-up. ''Everybody was hugging and crying,'' she said. ''You just don't care about any other stuff when something like this happens.''"
"International relief workers poured into this earthquake-devastated city on Sunday, finding rotting bodies and whole parts of town ruined. They struggled to provide water, shelter and medical supplies to desperate survivors of a city that now barely exists. With hopes for finding anyone alive in the rubble fast fading, teams from a number of countries, including the United States and Switzerland, scaled back their search and rescue efforts and turned their attention to the thousands of survivors, many of them suddenly homeless and bereaved. With the surge of assistance, the tiny airstrip that serves this ancient backwater on the Silk Road was clogged. State-run television said 16,000 people had been buried in the three days since the predawn quake in what had once been a city of more than 80,000. Estimates of the final toll have bobbed up and down imprecisely, but Interior Minister Abdolvahed Moussavi Lari said, ''I believe the number of dead will go beyond 20,000.'' At Heaven of Zahra, Bam's main cemetery, mass graves were dug with bulldozers in long trenches. Aghar, 29, who brought the bodies of his brother, his brother's wife and their three children in a truck, said he just wanted them to rest in peace. ''There is no time for anything,'' he said. ''We have too many dead and the bodies are getting rotten.'' The old quarter of the city is completely ruined. Few houses are standing in the modern section of town. With the decay, fear of an epidemic spread. Aid workers and most survivors wore masks on Monday. Bam was dealing with other ills, too, including a sudden rash of looting, which prompted the police to set up checkpoints and stop cars to check identity papers. With the relief convoys coming to the Bam airstrip, at one point the jam grew so intense that both the airport here and the larger field in the nearby provincial capital of Kerman were closed. Domestic flights for relief workers were either canceled or left idling in Tehran, waiting for clearance to take off. [An Iranian army helicopter crashed Sunday while on a relief mission, Reuters reported, citing the state news media. Two people on board were missing.] Despite the outpouring of relief efforts, the chances of finding many new survivors diminished, and the needs of the living took precedence. ''New teams have been set up to distribute food and check out the health of survivors,'' said Ali Asghar Ahmadi, a deputy interior minister. But the disaster here was so concentrated and intense that the attention has been focused only on Bam's population. The surrounding areas have largely been left on their own. ''The relief work is not enough because of the scale of the disaster,'' Ali Shafei, the governor of Bam, told local Kerman radio on Sunday. He said aid workers reached the town of Barvat, some eight miles away, only on Saturday. ''We need to build Bam from scratch,'' he said. The city still does not have power or running water. Most people say unsupervised building construction was the reason so many people died. Government buildings, including the governor's office and the municipality, have collapsed, too. ''The houses had steel in them but they were not designed to withstand earthquakes,'' said Maheri Alizadeh, 52, who lost 50 relatives. Her house, she said, was the only one not affected by the earthquake. ''Why shouldn't the government make sure that these houses are built properly in a country like here, where earthquakes are so frequent?'' she asked, sobbing. On the darkened, eucalyptus-lined streets of Bam, the scene was eerie. Residents wandered late into the night as if in a daze, still weeping at the magnitude of their losses. ''We feel pain, pain,'' said Kobrah Abbasi Nejad, 53, roaming past the fires flickering in a downtown traffic circle around 2 a.m. on Monday. Mrs. Nejad, her husband and two children escaped their house when an exterior wall fell away, but four grown children perished when the roof collapsed on them. ''My body aches, we can't sleep,'' she said, tears coursing down her cheeks into the folds of her flowing chador. ''We wish we had been killed, not them. They were so young.'' Pickup trucks roared through the streets regularly, with relief workers handing out more blankets, more water and surgical masks against the fear of disease and the odors of dust and death that gripped the town. The relief effort unrolled on a much larger scale at the Bam airport. The tiny field, actually built to service a newly growing car manufacturing plant, previously welcomed only a few flights per week. On Sunday, as many as 10 huge relief planes were parked there at once, their exhaust sending great clouds of dust and jet fuel billowing over the badly damaged terminal. Foreign nations and international relief organizations raced to get water, tents, medical supplies and other essential goods to the survivors of the quake on Friday. Fatimeh Ramezanpour, 37, thought the world had come to an end when, half asleep, she heard horrifying sounds of steel collapsing, and the air was suddenly filled with a strong smell of earth. It was 5:28 a.m. Friday. ''It took me a few minutes to realize what had happened,'' she said outside the pile of earth that used to be her two-bedroom house. She and her husband, with their two children, decided to sleep in their garden after two minor earthquakes on Thursday night. ''We thought the worst was that we would catch a cold but was better than getting caught under the rubble,'' she said. The walls around a 2,000-year-old mud-brick citadel have tumbled down, the minarets have collapsed, and the domes of the buildings have been crushed. ''The glory of 2,000 years fell overnight,'' said Ali, an aid worker who was seeing the place for the first time."
"As rescue workers raced to the ancient city of Bam, officials there raised the death toll from its 12-second earthquake on Friday to 25,000, and worried that it could go much higher. The interior minister, Abdolvahed Moussavi Lari, said on state television from Bam: ''The city is ruined. More than 70 percent of it is destroyed.'' Tens of thousands of the injured crowded field hospitals or lay helplessly in the streets. Survivors and rescuers dug frantically to uncover those still trapped. In Bam, Reuters reported, one man, Taher, cried over the body of his teenage son, calling out, ''Wake up, wake up!'' Another parent, Fatemeh, 35, mourned her two children, saying, ''I am burying myself in this grave.'' Aftershocks jolted the area, shaking down the already crumbled low-rise dwellings of clay tile, brick and concrete block. Dozens of international relief flights and supply shipments sped on their way, transporting everything from skilled rescue workers to water purification tablets. The United States said it was sending tons of medical supplies in a military airlift, as well as rescue squads and medical teams. Most rescue workers were flying here to Kerman, to make their way by land to Bam, 120 miles to the southeast. Iradj Sharifi, rector of the faculty of medicine in Kerman, said that in the pre-dawn earthquake, ''Five thousand people were killed on the spot and there are 20,000 people under the rubble.'' Brigadier Mohammadi, commander of the army in southeastern Iran, told state television, ''We need help -- otherwise we will be pulling corpses, not the injured, out of the rubble.'' There were grim but uncertain predictions that the death toll -- in a 2,000-year-old city of 80,000 people -- might keep growing. ''As more bodies are pulled out, we fear that the death toll may reach as high as 40,000,'' said Akbar Alavi, the governor of Kerman, the provincial capital, according to The Associated Press. ''An unbelievable human disaster has occurred.'' The earthquake, which Iranian agencies measured at 6.3 and American agencies at 6.7, rocked Bam, 610 miles southeast of the capital, Tehran, at 5:28 a.m. Friday. Government spokesmen said that foreign aid workers would not need entry visas and that aid would be welcome from everywhere but Israel. In a televised address, President Mohammad Khatami urged on rescue efforts, thanked the nations that were sending aid and said he was preparing to leave for Bam. Volunteer rescue workers from around the country hurried into the city, some equipped with shovels, some joining survivors in clawing through the rubble barehanded. About 7,000 police officers were sent to Bam to help with the aid operation, Reuters said. International rescue teams began arriving with sniffer dogs and detection equipment. One dog team dug out 20 survivors, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said. The use of dogs, which are considered unclean by most Muslims, was a sticking point in rescue efforts in 1990, after the most deadly earthquake ever to strike Iran. It killed about 50,000 people. On Saturday, state television showed film of bloodied victims being loaded onto planes. A provincial official, Saeed Iranmanesh, told The Associated Press that more than 9,000 of the injured were sent to hospitals throughout the country. The bodies of the dead lined streets. The International Red Crescent advised people in the city to wear gloves and face masks because of fears of an epidemic, Reuters reported. There were burials, but they were swift and brutal. Broad trenches were dug with earthmoving equipment to accommodate hundreds of bodies at a time, The Associated Press reported. State television showed some bodies being stowed in the trunks of cars. Many more bodies were collected at cemeteries, the agency reported. At another cemetery, The Associated Press said, workers prepared a mass grave as a cleric and 10 people prayed over a second. Muhammad Karimi brought the bodies of his wife and 4-year-old daughter for burial, the news agency said. ''This is the apocalypse,'' he said. ''There is nothing but devastation and debris.'' At a news conference, the news agency reported, Mr. Lari, the interior minister, said: ''Bam has turned into a wasteland. Even if a few buildings are standing, you cannot trust to live in them.'' Indeed, aftershocks wrecked many buildings that had survived the initial quake. Witnesses said the last section of Imam Khomeini hospital that had remained standing collapsed on Saturday during an aftershock. Another hospital had also been destroyed. About 600 prisoners escaped a ruined jail, local officials said, and other prisoners died in its wreckage, Reuters reported. Refugees poured out of Bam on Saturday, according to Agence France-Presse, with the main road to Kerman jammed with thousands of cars packed with belongings. Tens of thousands of people, their homes destroyed, spent the night outside. With temperatures hovering around freezing overnight, some gathered around fires. Many continued to search the rubble for family members. One woman cried and begged for help in front of her leveled house, according to a local journalist. The woman, Batul, 48, said her husband, 55, and three of her five children had died. Her daughter, 17, was badly injured but was among the relatively fortunate victims who received help at field hospitals. She had managed to find her husband's body, she said. ''I have lost everything, my home and my family,'' Batul said. ''We were all asleep when the earthquake happened and all I could do was to drag my 12-year-old son out of the house.'' State television showed an injured 5-year-old boy in a hospital in the city of Isfahan who said his mother and brother had been killed and his father taken to a hospital in Tehran. A Kerman City official, Ali Karimi, said the historic quarter of Bam -- a mud city dating to the early years of the first century -- was destroyed. Reports of injured and dead tourists began to filter in. The State Department said one American was killed and another seriously injured; the British Embassy in Tehran reported one British tourist missing. Rescuers and equipment were arriving from around the world, and Iranian officials organized their deployment, dividing the city into six broad sections. Planes from China, Canada, Russia, Denmark, Britain, Belgium and Italy arrived on Saturday carrying rescuers, dogs, food and electronic search equipment, and more planes were expected. The United Nations said it was sending a planeload of equipment on Sunday. Teams from about 20 countries were on the ground or about to arrive, Madeleine Moulin, a spokeswoman for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs, told Agence France-Presse. The White House, which has had tense relations with Iran, announced on Saturday afternoon that it would send more than 200 civilian experts in urban search and rescue, emergency surgery and disaster response coordination. The humanitarian delegation will include teams from Boston, Los Angeles and Fairfax County, Va., an administration statement said, along with disaster experts from the State Department and other agencies. Pentagon teams will deliver more than 150,000 pounds of medical supplies from bases in Kuwait, the statement said, adding that the government is working with the Iranian authorities, the United Nations and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent to rapidly distribute the assistance. The civilian teams will be flown to Iraq on Sunday by military transports, which will also carry food rations, blood, medicine, plastic sheeting, blankets and other supplies. Throughout the country, people tried to find ways to help, too. State television showed Iranians crowding hospitals to donate blood. People flooded aid centers with canned food, blankets and clothes. ''I feel like my own children are buried under the rubble,'' said a crying woman in Tehran, who donated blankets and bottled water. ''I want to go to the city and help, sending stuff is not enough.''"
"President Mohammad Khatami said Tuesday that the arrival of an American aid team in this earthquake-ravaged city was a welcome development but should be viewed as just that -- a humane gesture and not a harbinger of improving relations between the United States and the Islamic republic. ''Humanitarian issues should not be intertwined with deep and chronic political problems,'' Mr. Khatami said at a news conference in Kerman, the provincial capital. ''If we see a change both in the tone and behavior of the U.S. administration, then a new situation will develop in our relations.'' In Washington, the Bush administration on Tuesday hailed the contacts between Iran and the United States on earthquake relief as one of several ''positive developments'' between the countries in recent months. ''We reached out to the Iranians,'' said J. Adam Ereli, a State Department spokesman. ''We offered our assistance. That offer was accepted, and I don't think you can see that as anything but a positive development for the people of Iran.'' Some policy experts said there was now room for maneuvering, a chance to transcend the ''Axis of Evil'' versus ''Great Satan'' labels that each country has stuck on the other. Mr. Khatami also said Tuesday that the death toll from the quake was likely to reach 30,000. A disaster of such scope can create an opportunity for conversations that otherwise may not have taken place, the experts said. ''It could be interpreted as earthquake diplomacy,'' said Davoud Hermitas Bavand, a political scientist at Tehran University. ''It could be used as a starting point for dialogue.'' The brief transit of about 12 American aid workers through the damaged airport terminal here caused a frisson of excitement, with Iranian relief volunteers asking to have their pictures taken with the workers when they heard they were Americans. For their part, the Americans insisted that there was nothing political or particularly unusual in their presence. The last time a large group of Americans was in the country was in January 1981, when 52 American hostages were released from 444 days in captivity at the American Embassy in downtown Tehran. Relations, severed then, have never really improved. When asked if he had any qualms about being here, Kevin Garvey, a medical technician from Boston, said ''None whatsoever'' and several men behind him echoed the thought. ''This is what we do,'' added Mr. Garvey, part of a team expecting to establish a field hospital in Bam. ''I am totally apolitical when it comes to doing my duties.'' Two different teams of Americans are here, an urban search and rescue group from Fairfax, Va., and an international medical response group affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Although the Bush administration dispatched the groups, the Iranians have gone to great lengths to paint them as volunteers. Asked repeatedly about the issue at his news conference, President Khatami said the United States needed to assuage Iranian fears before relations could move forward. ''They must attract our confidence, and that requires resolving our differences,'' he said. ''They must respect our sovereignty. They keep on saying that they want to overthrow the Islamic Republic. We have not seen good intentions. We hope that the U.S. will change its behavior so that this wall of mistrust will break.'' A group of Iranian doctors watching the arrival of the Americans at the Bam terminal said they distinguished between Washington -- with its threats of ''regime change'' and its long history of trying to enforce worldwide economic sanctions -- and ordinary citizens. ''We still have problems with the American government; there are no diplomatic relations,'' said Ali Gorbawi, an anesthesia nurse. ''Humanitarian relations are fine, though. We welcome that.'' Out of such small seeds, though, diplomatic saplings may spring, some policy experts said. ''Every situation, every occasion, every incident, if used properly, could be used for constructive relations,'' said Mr. Bavand, the political scientist. ''In politics there is no such thing as not using an opportunity.'' A presidential adviser, Mohammad Shariati, conceded as much to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. ''There is no doubt that the way countries behave at the time of trouble for other countries will affect decision making and will pave the way for other matters,'' he said. ''But I do not think it is a very good time now to talk about change, unless we get a chance to bring up our demands as well.'' Washington has swung in recent years between trying to engage Iran and continuing to treat it as an outcast. Iran recently agreed to more wide-ranging international inspection of its nuclear research facilities, which it insists are for peaceful purposes. Iran has also voiced support for the American-led overthrow of Saddam Hussein, who waged an eight-year war across the Iran-Iraq border. At the same time, Iran has urged a speedy United States withdrawal from Iraq, evidently nervous at the prospect of tens of thousands of American soldiers bivouacked next door. In reacting to the American group arriving at Bam, one official drew a distinct comparison. ''You are talking about politics, but these are doctors,'' said Mohammad Akbari, Iran's deputy health minister. ''They are not Mr. Bush or Mr. Rumsfeld coming to kill us.'' Other countries that have recently had tense relations with Iran, especially regional neighbors like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan, were also sending in assistance, signaling a certain thaw. There is, of course, a constituency within the Iranian government that acts as if maintaining hostility toward the United States and its allies is one of the pillars that keeps the Islamic revolution alive. After the quake, Iran announced that it would accept aid from all nations except Israel, and Tehran has long supported militant Palestinian fundamentalist groups. Similar predictions of thaws in the past have come to naught -- including one in 1990 after a private American relief plane landed in Tehran ferrying supplies to the victims of a devastating earthquake in the Caspian region. That year, though, Iran left the United States off its thank-you list. The Bush administration's comments on Tuesday were among several in recent months trying to take advantage of Iran's latest cooperation on its nuclear weapons program. But direct contacts with Iran would be resumed only if the government in Tehran made further progress in shutting down terrorist operatives based in Iranian territory, American officials have said. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, in an interview with The Washington Post, was quoted as saying that Iran's recent actions had been ''encouraging'' and that the United States was open to ''the possibility of dialogue at an appropriate point in the future.'' An openness to talking with Iran had been signaled in late October by Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage, who told a Congressional panel that the United States was not seeking ''regime change'' in Iran and said a future dialogue might be appropriate. The change in the administration's tone occurred after senior envoys from France, Germany and Britain won agreement from Iran to accept new international inspections of some of its nuclear facilities and to suspend production of enriched uranium, a fuel for potential use in making weapons."
"A powerful earthquake shook northern Japan early this morning, causing power failures, setting fire to an oil refinery and derailing a train. At least 164 people were injured, most of them by falling objects in their homes, according to the NHK news network. No deaths were reported. Japan's National Meteorological Agency warned residents away from coastal areas, for fear that aftershocks would bring ocean waves, known as tsunamis. There were no immediate reports of widespread damage. The quake, with a magnitude of 8.0, struck at 4:50 a.m. in the Pacific Ocean about 50 miles off the southeastern coast of Hokkaido, Japan's northern island, about 600 miles north of Tokyo, according to the agency. Aftershocks, including a powerful one at 6:07 a.m., followed. NHK showed images of shelves shaking furiously inside an office, a fresh crack running up an asphalt road and a fire burning at a refinery in southern Hokkaido. Train service was suspended on Hokkaido after an express train derailed, injuring one of the 39 passengers, according to Kyodo News. In a fishing town called Samani, two small fishing boats capsized off the coast; in another town, Erimo, whose 2,200 residents were told to evacuate at 5 a.m., waves swept empty cars into the sea. In Kushiro, a southeastern city hit by high waves, 24,300 houses were left without power, according to Kyodo. Hiroaki Tanaka, a fire official in Kushiro, on Hokkaido's east coast, said in an interview with Reuters that 47 people were being treated at hospitals in the city. ''The situation seems to be settling down,'' he said. ''Aftershocks seem to be lessening. Injuries could rise though, if people head to hospitals in their own cars. We felt it shake for a very long time.'' Television pictures showed a fire and smoke billowing near an oil storage depot of the Idemitsu Kosan Company at a refinery in Tomakomai, a coastal city in southern Hokkaido. The company said it had closed the plant for safety reasons. Other pictures showed cracks in buildings and fallen tiles, and items spilled from supermarket shelves. Japan, which sits atop four tectonic plates, is one of the world's most seismically active countries, and tremors are regularly felt here. Last Saturday afternoon, a quake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale, originating in the Pacific off Tokyo, jolted the capital. Hokkaido, with a population of about five million, is sparsely inhabited compared to the rest of the country. Japan's last major earthquake occurred in Kobe in 1995. That tremor, which measured 7.2, killed more than 6,000 people. Correction: October 18, 2003, Saturday A map on Sept. 26 with an article about an earthquake in northern Japan mislabeled the ownership of the Kurile Islands. Although Russian-administered, they have been regarded internationally as disputed territory since they were occupied at the end of World War II."
"''YOU'RE invited to our annual New Year's Eve party in Colima,'' my old friend Roberta wrote me. She and her husband, Ken, assured me it was a sleepy place devoid of tourist attractions. They hoped it would stay that way. Colima is hardly a secret, being the capital of the southwestern Mexican state of the same name. Its past includes a characteristic type of pre-Columbian pottery and the distinction of being the first colonial city west of Mexico City, founded in 1523. As well as being a state capital, it's a university town with a population of 130,000. But, less than three hours from Guadalajara and 90 minutes from the Pacific Coast, Colima is off Mexico's usual travel circuits, and outsiders like Ken and Roberta, who bought a house there, are rare indeed. This Dec. 31, I danced in the New Year to mariachi music under the stars -- my third New Year's Eve in Colima. I stay in the town's most handsome hotel, the Ceballos, which shares the main square, the Jardín Libertad, with the cathedral, the government palace, the history museum and some shops. It must be admitted that textbook Mexican charm, in Colima, pretty much begins and ends with the plaza. I have found I can while away hours on the square, drinking beer or coffee at an outdoor cafe and admiring the jungly, palm-filled garden in the center, the Ceballos's dramatic Gothic arches, the neo-Classical interior of the cathedral or the de rigueur revolutionary mural on the staircase of the government palace. While by no means first-class examples, these emblems of Mexican town life have a nonchalant, seductive glamour. Off the square, strolling Colima's shabby (but safe) streets, I have other choice spots: the Jardín Torres Quintero, on the other side of the palace -- a more disciplined garden than the Libertad, alive with roses and ferns -- and the most disciplined garden of all, the Jardín Núñez, at Madero and Juárez. Along its pedestrian avenues that radiate from a central fountain, couples, grandparents and children, shoeshine men and juice-sellers carry on their business amid huge topiary birds and sky-scraping palms. The city's situation near two volcanoes and in an earthquake zone means that it has little architecture worthy of the name, old or new, and the standard building is a ground-hugging, one-story structure. Perched on the edge of disaster, fading, peeling, dignified Colima continues its precarious life without pinning its hopes on grand monuments or dressing up for visitors. Last year an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 caused at least nine deaths in Colima and hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. Each room in the Ceballos has a ceramic sign in the archway between bedroom and bathroom that says, ''En caso de sismo, párese aquí'' (''In case of earthquake, stand here''). This year, I eyed the decorative plaque with new respect. As a result of the earthquake, Colima now has an estimated 500 construction sites. Every so often, there's a rubble-strewn lot between two standing houses, like a missing tooth in a smiling mouth. One of the city's few remaining colonial buildings, the church of San Felipe de Jesús, at Constitución and Vicente Guerrero, has an elaborately carved 18th-century facade and a plaque noting that the revolutionary hero Miguel Hidalgo served here as a parish priest. Ominous cracks run like veins behind the altar, and the congregation has decamped to the chapel, leaving the main church bare except for a few lonely statues. But Colima has a long history of picking up the pieces. When I returned for New Year's I found all my favorite places intact, including a pleasing constellation of pastel houses with pilasters and window grilles around Andador Constitución and 5 de Mayo; the handicraft shops on Andador Constitución, where I never manage to buy anything; the covered market at Centenario and Manuel _lvarez, where I always find a lemon squeezer or earthenware mug I can't live without; and the city's three museums. Like Colima itself, the museums are small-scale, nontaxing and rewarding. On the Jardín Libertad, the Museo Regional de Historia has a good collection of local pre-Columbian pottery, and a one-page English guide to the artifacts. They include statues of agricultural deities, baleful and gnomic; flattish sculptures of men and women sitting on benches -- a sign of prestige in a hard-working society -- and an anthology of the ceramic dogs that are a hallmark of Colima pottery. (A dog statue in your tomb guaranteed entry to paradise.) In a room called the Zoología Fantástica, the dogs share space with statues of other mythological animals, among them a lovable pig apparently hiding his eyes, Siamese-twin ducks and a comical winged turtle. In addition to the permanent collection, the museum has an engaging temporary exhibit (until the end of this month) of Mexican calendar art from the 1930's to the 1960's. In this lush, highly colored never-never land, Indians with washboard abs carry off swooning bare-breasted Indian maidens; Hidalgo, bearing the banner of Our Lady of Guadalupe, is crowned with laurel and kissed on his bald pate by an angel wearing a poodle cut and spaghetti-strapped dress; and a gorgeous señorita, in regional costume and very high red heels, plants a Mexican flag on a stony peak. Great fun. Colima's other two museums have no English signs at all, but that frees you to concentrate on the artifacts. In the case of the Museo de Artes Populares about 15 minutes' walk north from the Jardín Libertad, two airy floors are devoted to the folk arts of western Mexico, especially those associated with local masks and dances. Frequently grouped by material, cases full of straw, tin or ceramic things will speak to you or not. I love the jointed Betty Boop-style dolls made of papier-mâché, wearing cloche hats, dangly earrings and white ankle socks. The museum has an appealing gift shop, with books, handmade toys and other crafts for sale, but I've never found it open. Maybe next year. About seven blocks west of the folk art museum, in a leafy, prosperous neighborhood, the Museo de las Culturas de Occidente is housed in a handsome modern building with a palm grove in the center. Wonderful objects stand on plinths against turquoise stucco walls, often vases in the round, ribbed shape of the calabash gourd, a Colima favorite for two millenniums. A bulbous jug from A.D. 300 has a face on its neck: realistic, deeply carved nose and ears; narrowed, appraising eyes. The jug's lip serves as the man's hat. On the second floor, where pottery is arranged thematically, a case describes the ''ciclo de vida'' (cycle of life). Small, charmingly detailed figures represent pregnancy, birth and infancy up to an aged man on his deathbed. Not all culture in these parts is so meditative. On Jan. 1, Roberta and Ken took six friends to the village of Comala, about 15 minutes outside Colima. (A taxi costs $6.25, at 11.2 pesos to the dollar, or you can take a bus from the Suburbana bus station.) The village, with cobblestone streets, has a church in mustard and gray stucco and a white-on-white appliquéd bandstand on the square. Outdoor cafes line one side of the square, and an order of beer (which comes in a plastic bucket with an opener on the side) brings with it generous rounds of free antojitos -- snacks like guacamole and tamales with various toppings. Solemn, tireless mariachi musicians serenade the drinkers, for about $18 for five songs, and take requests. Couples dance around the bandstand, and an occasional rider on horseback crosses the square, exciting the local dogs to barking madness. Next day, six of us traveled to Suchitlán, a poorer village about a dozen miles northeast of Comala. First we walked up a dusty road to the little collection of shacks -- cement blocks, twigs and corrugated iron roughly cobbled together -- where Herminio Candelario lives and works. Mr. Candelario is a nationally recognized maker of masks, often used for the pastorelas, or pageants, performed in the church and on the square, in which he takes a keen interest, and his workshop (more outside than inside) holds costumes, swords and other props as well as masks. Made of a light balsalike wood from trees that grow on his property, a brightly painted lion or three-eyed monster by Mr. Candelario or one of his sons, Gorgonio and José Guadalupe, costs $40. Smaller masks, like the speckled owl I fancied, cost $13.50. One of the group chose a fierce rooster that needed a few last touches; my owl lacked eyes. What kind of eyes did I want, Gorgonio asked me. Whatever you think best, I said. While our masks were being finished, we went to the village square for lunch. Los Portales de Suchitlán, a former coffee plantation, seats guests under coffee bushes grown leggy at tables covered with red, green and yellow checked cloths. You know a place is not geared to gringos when it doesn't serve margaritas. Instead, Los Portales offers tequilas, beers, superlative hot chocolate and the wicked local ponche, or punch, made of mezcal and peanuts. The food, including pozole, a hominy-and-pork stew, is similarly authentic. When we returned to the Candelarios', my owl mask was almost dry and transformed, its wide-awake yellow eyes circled with bold, black lashes. Palm-filled plazas, folk art and huevos Colima is two hours and 45 minutes from Guadalajara, by bus. A one-way ticket on the ETN line, including reserved seat, lunch and a movie, costs $16.50, at 11.2 pesos to $1. Where to Stay Hotel Ceballos, Portal Medellín 12, (312) 312 4444, fax (312) 312 0645 and www.vivecolima.com/hotelceballos, has 54 air-conditioned rooms, some interior and without windows. Ask for a room that overlooks the square; a double costs $67. There are exercise machines in a tiny gym, a very small rooftop pool, reading nooks in the broad hallways, and a second-floor sitting room that looks onto the square. Service is willing but not speedy. La Merced, Hidalgo 188, (52-312) 314 2734, has 34 fairly spartan but clean rooms arrayed around a central courtyard, in downtown Colima, at $20 for a double. Where to Eat In Colima, Mariscos Pepe's, Maclovio Herrera 284, (52-312) 313 3053, has a grass roof, red plastic chairs and terrific seafood. A meal for one of assorted hors d'oeuvres, garlicky shrimp and beer costs about $9. Open 9 a.m. to midnight. On the southwest corner of the Jardín Libertad, El Trebol, (52-312) 312 2900, is a good outdoor cafe for breakfast and lunch. Huevos al gusto (eggs the way you like them), sweet rolls and coffee cost about $5.25. Open 8:30 a.m. to 11 p.m.; closed on Sunday. Los Portales de Suchitlán, (52-312) 395 4452, is open from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Guacamole, chiles rellenos or a Mexican steak, and a flan de Nescafé (coffee-flavored baked custard), with tequila, costs about $13.50 for one. What to See The Museo Regional de Historia, (52-312) 312 9228, at Morelos and Reforma, is open Tuesday through Saturday, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Sunday 5 to 8 p.m. Admission $2.40 (free on Sunday). The Museo de Artes Populares, at Gabino Barreda and Manuel Gallardo, (52-312) 312 6869, is open Tuesday though Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and from 5 to 8 p.m., and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Admission 90 cents (free on Sunday). The Museo de las Culturas de Occidente, at Calzada Pedro Galván, (52-312) 313 0608, is open Tuesday through Sunday 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Admission $1.35.

"OPENING MEXICO The Making of a Democracy. By Julia Preston and Samuel Dillon. Illustrated. 594 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $30. WHEN the Aztec earth mother Coatlicue told her 401 children -- the stars and moon -- that she was pregnant with the sun, they cut off her head in a jealous rage to keep their brother from being born. The Aztec sun god Huitzilopochtli emerged nevertheless, fully grown at birth, armor clad and vengeful. He decapitated the moon, banishing her head and the stars to the night sky. ''Opening Mexico,'' Julia Preston and Samuel Dillon's sweeping account of a nation's struggle for democracy, takes this tale as emblematic of power in Mexico, ''of jealous violence countered by vengeance; of mob insurrection quelled by the ascent of a single awesome ruler, more feared than loved.'' Herein lies the deepest challenge to the opening of Mexico to political and economic change: the fear that without an authoritarian leader, an unruly populace will destroy the nation. This fear explains the grip that the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, held over Mexico for seven decades of essentially one-party rule. The party was created in 1929 after two decades of chaos prompted by the overthrow of the dictator Porfirio Díaz and the failed presidency of the gentle Francisco Madero. In his quixotic attempt at democracy, Madero made the fatal error of failing to shoot his enemies before they shot him. ''Opening Mexico'' is equal in ambition and scope to ''Distant Neighbors,'' the monumental 1985 account by Alan Riding, like Preston and Dillon a former Mexico correspondent for The New York Times. Riding wrote in broad strokes, organizing his material thematically. By contrast, Preston and Dillon have filled in the spaces with the raw, vibrant details of the lives of contemporary Mexicans. At times, readers might wish for a bit -- though not too much -- more analytical elaboration of the type that Riding doled out so generously. Yet Preston and Dillon more than make up for this minor shortcoming with their classic, nuanced storytelling. Indeed, the difference in styles mirrors the times: Riding described the Miguel de la Madrid administration, when Mexico still seemed unable to break out of a closed system. Preston and Dillon have taken on a Mexico bursting at the seams, where many previously hidden realities are now out in the open. In 2000, Mexicans elected Vicente Fox by a landslide, kicking out the PRI. This extraordinary event took place as Latin America was losing faith in democracy. According to the Chilean research firm Latinobarometro, the number of Latin Americans believing that democracy is the best form of government fell from over 60 percent in the late 1990's to just 48 percent in 2001. Mexico was one of the few countries where support for democracy rose. The stakes were high for Fox, an outspoken former Coca-Cola executive from the National Action Party, or PAN. So were expectations, despite the odds: the new president faced entrenched corruption, a bureaucracy filled with PRI stalwarts, a justice system undermined by drug traffickers and institutions so dependent on the PRI that the lower legislative house had no procedures for apportioning committees when the PRI did not hold a majority. Given these obstacles, Mexicans soon became disillusioned with their new government. A recent Latinobarometro poll has shown that more Mexicans approved of their ''democracy'' in 1996 -- under the PRI -- than in 2003. By Preston and Dillon's account of how Mexico got here, any other result would have been a surprise, for the biggest obstacle to a democratic future for Mexico remains its authoritarian past. The authors cite the Mexican intellectual Carlos Fuentes, who has said that the present is merely the accumulation of frustrated goals of the past: ''There is no single time: all of our times are alive, all of our pasts are present.'' Perhaps Mexico's most powerful collective memory is of the Oct. 2, 1968, massacre, when government troops fired on a crowd of citizens protesting the policies of President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz. The massacre took place, fittingly, at a plaza commemorating the Tlatelolco battle in which the Spanish conquistadores defeated the last Aztec emperor, Cuauhtémoc. Preston and Dillon are particularly good at showing how the events of Tlatelolco became a living presence in Mexico's struggle for democracy over the following three decades. Aztec mythology held that the world was created and destroyed four times before its current incarnation, which an earthquake would destroy in turn. In a sense, the 1985 earthquake that devastated Mexico City did destroy a world -- that of a government many Mexicans believed could never be cracked open. The quake literally uncovered evidence of Mexico's repressive past, seven corpses that medical examiners found to have been tortured. Buildings near the 1968 massacre site trembled, and when one of them collapsed, neighborhood residents created a citywide citizens' movement to protest the government's failure to help them. Similar movements brought about change on a larger scale. In 1988, Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas -- named for the last Aztec king and the son of the ruling party's first leader -- embodied the opposition's hopes in the closest presidential election ever. When the PRI declared its candidate the winner after huge and obvious fraud, Cárdenas responded with calm rather than violence. His decision, as Preston and Dillon show, would play a pivotal role in breaking a cycle of destruction and despair. President Carlos Salinas liberalized the economy and made gestures toward political opening. Yet he relied unabashedly on autocratic methods that eventually destroyed his legacy. When opposition parties amassed evidence of fraud in state elections, for example, Salinas appointed ''compromise'' candidates, pretending to support democracy while handpicking 60 percent of Mexico's governors. In 1994, the presidency passed to the PRI technocrat Ernesto Zedillo. He courageously set about to reform Mexico, despite growing opposition from the party dinosaurs who mocked him as a weakling. Zedillo's first challenge -- a hangover from Salinas -- was an economic crisis; foreign reserves were fleeing the country, which forced him to make a humiliating devaluation. He then arrested his own drug czar, Gen. Jesús Gutiérrez Rebollo, for colluding with narcotraffickers, just nine weeks after the United States' antidrug chief had heralded Gutiérrez as ''a guy of unquestioned integrity.'' Preston and Dillon give Zedillo ample and well-deserved credit for being the architect of many of the political reforms that led to the dramatic opening that swept Fox into power. Yet their portrait of the mild-mannered, Clark Kentish president is oddly contradictory -- or not so oddly, considering that one of Latin America's enduring mysteries is its ability to accommodate opposing realities simultaneously. ''Zedillo, in his self-imposed remove, had little understanding of how dysfunctional the PRI system had become,'' they write, even as they document his herculean efforts to change it. They take him to task for being a reformer of institutions, not of individuals, even as they present the struggles of many courageous individuals inside and outside the government who pushed to change the institutions. Indeed, Preston and Dillon's central explanation of why Mexico finally cracked open lies in the momentum created by such individuals, both mighty and meek, who took on a system that was decaying from within. And this is where ''Opening Mexico'' truly shines. Intellectuals -- Fuentes, Octavio Paz, Héctor Aguilar Camín, Enrique Krauze -- repeatedly called for reform. Josefina Ricaño, the wife of a wealthy businessman whose son was kidnapped and murdered, channeled her grief and rage into a citizens movement that in 1997 united Mexicans across class and color lines to protest crime. On the border, the labor leader Julia Quiñónez fought for the rights of workers in American-owned factories. In 1999, the grandson of a general involved in the Tlatelolco massacre agreed to publish his late grandfather's memoirs uncovering the truth. These stories are Mexico's present and future. For if there is despair in a long history of tragedy, there is also great reason for hope in the lives of the many Mexicans chronicled here who have uncovered secrets and forced change, defying the legend of Huitzilopochtli. Michele Wucker, a senior fellow at the World Policy Institute, is the author of ''Why the Cocks Fight: Dominicans, Haitians, and the Struggle for Hispaniola.''"
"Iran has rebuffed an offer from the United States to send a delegation led by Senator Elizabeth Dole to assist in the distribution of relief supplies to earthquake victims in Bam, the Bush administration said Friday. The offer had been seen by the administration as a gesture of American concern for Iran at a time when the United States has declared that some -- but not all -- of Iran's recent actions have been positive and could lead to a resumption of dialogue to improve relations. Administration officials said Tehran cited the overwhelming difficulties facing relief workers in the ancient city of Bam in southeastern Iran as the reason it could not accommodate the American offer now. The officials did not rule out the possibility of a future visit, however. ''We have heard back today from the Iranians that, given the current situation in Bam and all that is going on there now, it would be preferable to hold such a visit in abeyance,'' said J. Adam Ereli, a State Department spokesman. ''Therefore, we are not pursuing it further at the moment.'' Mr. Ereli said the message from Iran had been conveyed to James B. Cunningham, the deputy American representative to the United Nations, by the Iranian permanent representative at the United Nations, Dr. M. Javad Zarif. Dr. Zarif could not be reached for comment. Administration officials said the decision to make the offer to send Mrs. Dole, a former president of the American Red Cross, came after the senator suggested the idea herself. A spokesman for Mrs. Dole, a North Carolina Republican, said that based on her experience overseeing relief deliveries from the Red Cross to Rwanda, Somalia and other disaster areas, she wanted both to assist operations in Iran and to report back to Congress. The mere possibility of an exchange between Washington and Tehran, even on a nonpolitical subject, piqued the interest of diplomats and specialists who have been watching the twists and turns of American policies since President Bush labeled Iran a member of the ''axis of evil'' two years ago. The United States has repeatedly denounced Iran for what American officials say is an advanced nuclear weapons program and broad support for Hezbollah and other militant groups that have attacked Israelis, Americans and others. On the other hand, the United States has recently praised Iran for its support of the American invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. In October, the United States welcomed Iran's agreement to open its nuclear facilities to inspection, but considered as inadequate Tehran's decision to ''suspend'' its uranium enrichment operations, which Washington wants to see dismantled. Direct conversations between American and Iranian officials on Iraq and other subjects were held sporadically until May, when the United States suspended the talks after determining that a series of bombings in Saudi Arabia were carried out by groups based in Iranian territory. From the beginning, there has been an internal debate over whether the administration should take a conciliatory approach to Iran or a confrontational one, including military pressure and interdiction of nuclear materials shipped to and from the country. Mrs. Dole's spokesman said she broached the idea of a relief mission with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell on Monday and also with Bill Frist, the Senate majority leader. The offer to send Mrs. Dole was first disclosed Friday by The Washington Post. In a statement issued Friday evening, Mrs. Dole said she had acted after seeing television reports of the ''horrendous Iranian tragedy.'' She said she still hoped that ''this humanitarian visit will be accepted by the Iranians because the American people are most willing to help.'' An administration official said Mr. Bush had, at the same time, been discussing with his aides the possibility of making a stronger show of American concern, possibly by sending a high-level delegation that would include a member of his own family. ''It occurred to everyone to add A and B and get to C,'' said the official, referring to those two factors. ''The administration was looking for a message saying that we care and wanted to help them in a moment of need.'' No political intent aimed at signaling a change in administration policy was intended, the official said. Indeed, Mr. Bush on Thursday said Iran still had to rid itself of terrorists and nuclear weapons programs and to open its political system before relations could improve. ''Political motives should not be read into it,'' an administration official said, referring to the offer to send the delegation. ''Nor do we read political motives in the fact that the Iranians said it's not a good time to do it.'' There was even some debate in the administration about whether Iran had definitively shut the door on a visit to deal with the disaster, which struck last week and killed as many as 40,000 people. One official described Iran's reaction as a rejection but then corrected himself to say the trip was ''in abeyance -- whatever that means.'' The United States has ordered a temporary easing of trade restrictions on Iran to speed the flow of aid. Like North Korea, another member of the ''axis of evil'' proclaimed by Mr. Bush, Iran has bedeviled the administration by what American officials regard as its erratic behavior -- occasionally supportive on some matters but unrepentant on backing Islamic militant organizations and on its nuclear ambitions. By all accounts, the relief delegation envisioned by Mrs. Dole was not intended to serve as a vehicle to renew talks. But officials acknowledged that in such a situation, one small step could lead to another, and that before long the two sides could be talking again. Correction: January 3, 2004, Saturday Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the Bush administration's suggestion that it might send a special delegation to help with Iran's earthquake relief omitted credit for the publication that first reported the development. It was The Washington Post. (Later developments are reported today on Page A1.)"
"A 57-year-old man buried by rubble in an earthquake was rescued 13 days later by workers in the southeastern city of Bam, state television news reported Thursday. The man, who was alert when found but has since slipped into a coma, gave his first name as Jalil. He was said to have come to Bam from a provincial town for medical treatment the day before the quake. Workers said he survived because he had been trapped under a closet, which left him some breathing space. Mehdi Shanoush, an Iranian doctor at the Ukrainian-Iranian field hospital, said he believed Jalil must also have had access to water. ''It seems he had some water because around him was wet,'' Dr. Shanoush told Reuters. ''When he arrived at the hospital his signs of life were very weak. He was frozen, and now he is in a coma.'' Dr. Shanoush also told the Islamic Republic News Agency that Jalil was suffering from a serious lung infection. More than 30,000 people are estimated to have died in the quake, which occurred on Dec. 26. Jalil was the first victim to have been found alive since a 97-year-old woman was rescued on Saturday. Nighttime temperatures in Bam have fallen to freezing since the earthquake, and hope of finding any more survivors is scant. Aftershocks in recent days have hit nearby provinces, raising concerns about further loss of life. In particular three towns in the southwestern province of Khuzestan -- Izeh, Masjed Soleyman and Baghmalek -- have suffered 36 lower-level jolts in the past two days, the state television reported. -------------------- U.N. and Red Cross Ask for Funds UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 8 (Reuters) -- The United Nations and the Red Cross on Thursday began a $73 million appeal for victims of the earthquake that razed the Iranian city of Bam, killing 30,000 people. United Nations' agencies are trying to raise $31.3 million and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is hoping for $42 million. The money will be used over the next three months to provide medical care, revive agricultural production, restore water and sanitation services and educate children, among other efforts, Jan Egeland, the United Nations coordinator for emergency relief, said. The Dec. 26 earthquake, which had a magnitude of 6.8, destroyed 90 percent of the city's buildings, including hospitals and schools."
"Adele Freedman sat in a wheelchair at a hospital in Queens yesterday and recalled the horror of last month's earthquake in Bam, Iran. Shortly after the quake, she and her fiancé, Tobb Dell'Oro, lay trapped by the wreckage of their guest house, choking on dust and bleeding. ''We're going to die,'' she recalled saying. But Mr. Dell'Orro replied: ''No, we're not. They're going to get us out. We're going to be fine.'' Ms. Freedman, 39, a Long Island native, survived the catastrophic Dec. 26 earthquake in that killed at least 30,000 people. At a news conference yesterday before her release from New York Hospital Medical Center in Flushing, she said she had mixed emotions about surviving: Mr. Dell'Oro, a California marketing firm executive, died. He was the only American known to have been killed in the earthquake. ''I just lost my partner and the man I love and the person I want to spend the rest of my life with,'' Ms. Freedman said, choking back tears. ''So I don't feel lucky, even though I know I am very lucky.'' She was wheeled into the news conference accompanied by her doctors and her parents: Dr. Philip Freedman, an anesthesiologist at the hospital, and her mother, AnnaMae. ''This is really overwhelming,'' she said, laughing uncomfortably amid the crush of hospital workers, reporters and television cameras. Ms. Freedman grew up in Great Neck, N.Y., and moved to California, where she worked as a lawyer. She met Mr. Dell'Oro, 41, who owned a market research firm, in 1998. She said that before the quake, they were having a wonderful time in Iran, enchanted by the friendliness and hospitality of the people. Mr. Dell'Oro was having fun trying to learn the language, and the locals were amused by his phrase book. On Christmas Day, they arrived in Bam and explored its ancient citadel. Over dinner, he proposed to her, fulfilling a long-held wish she had harbored. Both Cornell graduates, they had met at a party in 1998. Mr. Dell'Oro told her then that he had grown up in Saudi Arabia and enjoyed traveling and exploring other cultures. She shared his sense of adventure, and they visited Laos and Cambodia and Morocco together. ''He had a real affinity for the Arab world,'' Ms. Freedman said yesterday. She had already picked out a wedding dress. Recently, they had moved in together and begun to discuss having children. They visited doctors seeking advice on having a baby, despite her bout with cancer. That night in Bam, they slept in a one-story guest house in the center of town. Around dawn, the building rumbled and Mr. Dell'Orro jumped out of his twin bed and headed toward her, but both were pinned by rubble, she to her pillow. ''I was trying to breathe slowly and relax and stay calm'' to conserve oxygen, she said. They lay in the dark, in silence, beneath the rubble. They could not move or see each other. It was there, in the dark, that he began asking her what kind of engagement ring she wanted. She said she simply wanted them to survive. After several hours, they heard digging. It was their tour guide, Farzaneh Khademi, who had rushed to the guest house with a rescue party. By about 10 a.m. the rescuers had pulled them out. Mr. Dell'Oro was bleeding badly from the chest and Ms. Freedman told Ms. Khademi to apply pressure and make a tourniquet. The guide began using her scarf to make one. But soon, Mr. Dell'Oro could no longer speak. ''I kept telling him how much I love him and that he had to stay alive and not to leave me,'' she said. ''He wasn't answering,'' she said. ''He was just blinking.'' Mr. Dell'Oro died in an ambulance during the roughly 150-mile ride to a hospital. Ms. Freedman was driven to a hospital in Teheran, where surgeons worked on her feet and ankles. She learned of his death days later. ''Ms. Freedman described how he had helped her survive cancer several years ago, helping her out of bed when she was too weak to manage on her own. They were now looking forward to spending the rest of their lives together. ''This is probably the hardest thing I've ever been through in my life,'' she said, ''and I thought I'd already been through that.'' Yesterday, she credited her survival to the ''kindness of the Iranian people,'' and said that, as hard as it would be to ever return to Iran, she would like to help build a school or a hospital in Bam. ''I'd like to go back because I know Tobb would want me to go back,'' she said, ''but it would be very difficult. ''We had five, or four, really amazing years,'' she said. Before she was wheeled out, she said: ''He would want me to get on with my life.''"
"In defending against disasters, society plays a complicated game against nature that has unclear rules and high stakes. Still, we improve our odds of surviving earthquakes, floods and hurricanes by carefully choosing how and where we build. For example, last month's earthquake in Iran -- where lax construction standards mean that buildings collapse even without natural disasters -- killed more than 30,000 people. But earthquakes of similar strength in California, which has strict rules, cause far fewer deaths (last month's earthquake there killed two people, and even the slightly stronger 1994 Northridge earthquake, in a densely settled area of Los Angeles, killed only 61 people). Surely, then, it would be best for people in areas around seismically active faults to choose the most earthquake-resistant construction available. Not necessarily. Certainly, construction standards that are too weak will result in death and destruction, as demonstrated by recent disasters in India and Armenia, as well as Iran, whereas low fatality rates in California show the value of strict standards. More isn't always better, however. In areas that are considerably less at risk for a major earthquake, standards that are too stringent may divert money from other health and safety measures that would save more lives. The wiser course, in a world of limited resources, is to not apply blanket rules but to carefully develop standards for specific regions that balance costs and benefits. Consider the case of Memphis and other communities within the New Madrid seismic zone, which covers an area of more than 100,000 square miles, including parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee. Earthquakes there are typically more a nuisance than a catastrophe: the largest in the past century, a magnitude 5.5 earthquake in 1968, knocked down log cabins but caused no fatalities. A series of major earthquakes, the biggest of which seismologists now say probably had a magnitude around 7.3, did occur near New Madrid, Mo., in 1811 and 1812, before there was much settlement. But such strong earthquakes come only every 500 years or so, far less often than in California. As far as we know, no one has ever died in an earthquake in the New Madrid zone. Yet the Federal Emergency Management Agency is pushing cities and states in the seismic zone to strengthen construction standards to levels comparable to California's. Such earthquake codes require builders to use techniques that allow structures to flex without breaking when the ground shakes, but for a much bigger range of motion than Memphis is likely to experience during the life of its buildings. FEMA documents indicate that this is being proposed with almost no consideration of costs and benefits, even though we estimate the earthquake risk in the New Madrid zone to be one-tenth to one-third that of California's. Our back-of-the envelope estimates illustrate the new code's costs and benefits: over its approximately 50-year life, a building in Memphis loses about 1 percent of its value because of earthquakes, while the new code could increase a building's cost 5 percent to 10 percent. FEMA's recommendation to retrofit hospitals, highways, bridges and other structures adds more costs. For example, retrofitting the Memphis Veterans' Hospital (federal buildings automatically follow FEMA guidelines) cost about $100 million, comparable to the cost of a new building. The tradeoffs are high. Money spent strengthening schools isn't available for teachers' salaries, upgrading hospitals may mean treating fewer uninsured patients, and stronger bridges may result in hiring fewer police officers. The proposed code may over time save a few lives per year, while the same money invested in health or safety measures (flu shots, defibrillators, highway upgrades) could save many more. The same is true for other natural disasters. For example, after Hurricane Andrew, Florida adopted a building code that significantly increases the hurricane resistance of structures. This adds thousands of dollars to the costs of building a house, for instance, but makes sense because of the state's history. Whether such standards make sense for Long Island, New Jersey, or other coastal areas that experience hurricanes less frequently depends on whether the increased costs yield commensurate benefits. Some officials in the New Madrid zone, including those in Memphis, are resisting FEMA's push for states and cities to adopt the agency's guidelines. But not surprisingly, other municipalities in an area with little experience of earthquakes are putting their trust in FEMA, the government's authority on managing natural disasters. In this case, as in many others involving safety and health, we might be able to save a lot of money without risking lives. An objective assessment by outside analysts, perhaps sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences, could realistically estimate the hazard and the costs and benefits of various earthquake codes. For example, many of the codes already in place in the New Madrid seismic area may make sense. Or it may turn out that standards closer to California's are warranted. Given the large sums at stake, time spent getting things right would be well spent. Op-Ed Contributor Seth Stein is professor of geology at Northwestern.

"Iran's lukewarm response to overtures by the United States stemming from American assistance for the Bam earthquake victims fueled a widening debate on Saturday on the Islamic Republic's relations with its longtime adversary. Hard-liners who have always viewed adverse relations with Washington as a pillar of the Islamic revolution are dismissing the American statements as just more ''trickery from the Great Satan,'' while reformists fret aloud that Iran is about to miss yet another opportunity to end its international isolation. Neither side appreciated President Bush's repeating of American demands on Iran in the same breath as his promise to amplify aid to quake victims, but the debate here appears likely to become an important issue in parliamentary elections just six weeks away. ''I think it is a kind of missed opportunity for achieving a rapprochement in Iranian-U.S. relations,'' said Elaheh Koulai, a reformist member of the foreign relations committee in Parliament. ''I don't think this kind of rejection serves our interests.'' On Friday, Iran rejected an offer from Washington to send a delegation to assess the need for further assistance and to help with the distribution of relief supplies in Bam, where 30,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were left homeless in an earthquake on Dec. 26. Officials in Washington said Iran cited the difficult conditions in Bam as the reason for not accepting the delegation, although Tehran did not close the door to a future visit. Conservatives quickly condemned the American offer and attacked Iranian officials who welcomed it. Measures included dispatching 81 aid workers to Bam to staff a hospital and to survey the damage, as well as the temporary suspension of some economic sanctions to allow private donations to Iran. ''If these officials favor resuming ties with the United States, they must not speak so eagerly, instead they should speak in a way to get advantages and force the other side to abandon its overpowering tone,'' said an editorial in Jomhouri Islami, a newspaper close to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Analysts here believe the timing of the American offer probably led to its rejection. By late next week the Guardian Council is expected to announce the names of the thousands of Iranians allowed to run in parliamentary elections on Feb. 20. Reformists swept the elections four years ago, but conservatives were hoping to retake the body this year. In municipal elections last year, voters stayed home in droves as a kind of protest toward economic stagnation and lack of political change. Conservatives thus dominate most municipal councils. They expected to do the same with parliamentary elections and would like try to stave off anything that might change that plan, analysts believe. ''I think it is too much of a sudden change for the conservatives to get themselves reorganized on such an issue,'' said Sadegh Zibakalam, a political scientist at Tehran University. If relations improved, it would mean abandoning a central tenet of the Islamic revolution, while if talks quickly fell apart, then voters might punish them, the professor said. It is generally acknowledged that the Iranian public would welcome relations with the United States. Economic sanctions hobble the country's economic development, limiting foreign investment and curbing access to much needed equipment like modern airplanes and computers. ''Iranians feel that it is a new opportunity that should be capitalized on and accepted for solving the longstanding problems between the two countries,'' said Davoud Hermidas Bavand, also a political science professor at Tehran University. Reformist newspapers were quick to try to seize the opportunity to point out that keeping the United States at arm's length might backfire on the conservatives, as voters dismayed by the policy might find reason to go to the polls after all. But Iranians from both camps were dismayed that President Bush had repeated American conditions for improving ties with Iran, including more democracy and cooperation on preventing terrorism. ''I think these matters are internal affairs,'' said Ms. Koulai, the member of Parliament. One government official suggested that Iran's strategic interests in the Persian Gulf and its economic interests -- especially developing its lagging oil industry and delivering advanced consumer goods to more than 60 million Iranians -- run parallel with those of the United States. ''They are always pointing a finger at Iran and accusing them of these things and that becomes a big hindrance to improving relations,'' one official said. One reformist newspaper marveled at the apparent repetitive pattern in relations, comparing it to an ancient Iranian love tale in which two ill fated lovers, Ramy and Veis, continuously try and fail to unite, leaving each lobbing bitter recriminations at the other. ''For the past 25 years this scenario of Ramy and Veis keeps repeating itself,'' said an editorial in the Yass-e-na daily. ''Through all these years neither country has been able to erase the other from its dreams or its future plans.''"
"Iran is considering moving its capital from Tehran after the earthquake last month that devastated the southern city of Bam, killing more than one-third of the population there. Tehran is on a major seismological fault, and experts have long warned that an earthquake here could be catastrophic. Tehran has a population of more than 12 million and is one of the most earthquake-prone regions in the country. The head of the country's Supreme National Security Council, Hassan Rowhani, told Iranian state television that the idea of moving the capital was being studied by the council and that a decision would be reached by the end of March, which is the end of the Iranian calendar year. Mr. Rowhani said the council had proposed the plan in 1991. A government spokesman, Abdullah Ramezanzadeh, told reporters on Monday that moving the capital had also been proposed in 1989 because of the city's large population, chaotic traffic, pollution and earthquake risk. ''There have been contradictory views, and still our experts have not been able to reach a conclusion,'' he said. Some 100,000 people have been killed in 11 earthquakes over the last half-century in Iran. Officials have acknowledged since the Dec. 26 earthquake in Bam, which killed as many as 40,000 people, that the building codes in Tehran and other cities had not been adequately enforced. Mud bricks are commonly used to build homes in Iran. They are cheap and popular because they keep houses cool in summer and warm in winter. But they collapse easily in an earthquake. President Mohammad Khatami said at a news conference last week that there would be an inquiry into building practices and that those who violated building codes would be punished. He pointed to a former mayor of Bam who had waived building codes during the construction of a housing complex for war veterans. All the houses crumbled, killing their residents. The head of the union for construction engineers, Alireza Sarhadi, told the Iranian Labor News Agency that according to a recent study some 70 percent of buildings would be destroyed in Tehran if it were struck by an earthquake with a similar magnitude of the one in Bam. Bahram Akasheh, professor of geophysics at Tehran University, wrote in a letter to President Khatami that such an earthquake would kill more than 700,000 in Tehran and destroy government buildings, leaving the state powerless to respond. He proposed moving the capital to the central city of Isfahan, which was the country's capital in the late 16th century. The capital was moved to Tehran in 1788. Tehran was hit by a major earthquake in 1830. Another scientist, Nasser Karami, proposed in the daily newspaper Hamshahri on Monday that old buildings be strengthened instead. He argued that the only seismologically safe places in the country were in the unlivable desert of central Iran. Hassan Moghimi, the construction deputy at the Interior Ministry, was quoted in the newspaper Shargh as saying that the government had approved a $300 million budget for reconstruction of old buildings in Tehran and six other cities. The money is aimed at making buildings more earthquake resistant, he said. Mr. Ramezanzadeh also said that additional efforts had been made to make Tehran safer. ''The government's latest move was securing Tehran's natural gas pipeline network,'' he said."
"For the past 24 years, the Stars and Stripes was unfurled publicly in Iran only to be burned, so Iranians were astonished on Wednesday by its sudden unveiling in an official capacity -- not fluttering in the frigid winter wind, exactly, but glued to the peaked roofs of the three tents housing the American earthquake relief team. ''I guess that is O.K., but if they try to raise a flag, that will be a problem,'' said Sayid Muhammad Hashemi, a burly, bearded clergyman who brought his motorcycle to a screeching halt when he saw the flags. ''In my opinion the Americans should not be here. They came to Iran to unearth dead bodies while at the same time in Afghanistan and Iraq they are killing people.'' The erection of the tents for the 81-member United States team at the Revolutionary Guard base here, where dozens of other nations are already housed, drew a crowd of curious onlookers. Some locals expressed delight that the Americans were here in any capacity. ''The Iranian people don't have any problems with the Americans; it's the Iranian system that has the problem,'' one man said. But another voiced suspicion that the Americans were spies -- why had they waited a full five days after the huge quake to show up? -- while Mr. Hashemi fretted that a pillar of Iran's Islamic Revolution might be crumbling. ''Remember, the late Imam Khomeini always warned us that the relationship between your government and our government is that of a wolf to a sheep,'' said the cleric, a member of the Baseeji, volunteers who seek to keep the message of the revolution alive. The flags were not the day's only incongruous sight. Two large trucks labeled Fairfax County Fire & Rescue Department rolled past a portrait of the late revolutionary patriarch to get into the base. At the campsite itself the men and women -- some 30 members of the team are women -- worked side by side to put up the tents. The women fashioned head scarves from orthopedic arm slings because the prepacked emergency supplies lacked Islamically correct headgear. The Americans acknowledged that a series of mishaps and transportation mix-ups had delayed their arrival to the point when search and rescue teams from other countries were leaving. A good dozen have already departed. But the Americans expect to stay at least one week. The American team consists of two groups, about 20 from the search and rescue team and the rest the staff of a field hospital equipped for surgery, part of an international medical response group affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. The search and rescue team will work with the Iranian Red Crescent to help assess the damage to the city's infrastructure and draw up a list of needs to be distributed to international donors. Various nations have sent medical teams, but with 11,000 wounded evacuated after the city's three hospitals were leveled, there are no seriously wounded to treat. Instead the United States will join other countries in providing regular medical care. The team started setting up the nine-tent hospital in the early evening and expected to have it running by the time the New Year arrived. ''We are here to help restore normal medical care to this community, to deal with the problems of everyday life in any country -- babies, appendectomies,'' said Dr. Susan Briggs, the director of the hospital. Brig. Gen. Hamid Aslawi, the Revolutionary Guard officer in charge of operations for the city, said it would be a welcome development. Many of the emergency response teams were more geared to trauma than to dispensing simple things like aspirin, he said. But the patient load could dwindle somewhat because the city's population is gradually fleeing. With something under half the population of 97,000 either killed or injured and 90 percent of the buildings destroyed, the surviving residents are streaming out of Bam. General Aslawi estimated that only about 15,000 residents remained, most living in tents on the wreckage of former homes. Four different tent cities are being set up on Bam's outskirts to house 10,000 people, with the first residents expected to move in on Thursday, he said. That will make it easier for the bulldozers to remove the rubble and basically flatten the city. General Aslawi said just 68 bodies were recovered on Tuesday and he could not confirm any reports of survivors found Wednesday. The real problem, the general said, is the need to provide long-term housing for the residents while the city is rebuilt. It will take at least three to six months for even temporary housing to be ready. He unfurled a satellite picture of the city that showed the Afraz fault line slicing across the edge of the city like a wedge-shaped butcher knife. ''The idea has been raised that we should not rebuild here at all because of the extent of the damage and the presence of the fault line,'' he said. ''But geopolitically it is a very strategic place -- this is where the main routes from Pakistan and Afghanistan converge.'' For residents, the main problem was keeping warm, with temperatures dropping below freezing at night. Residents living in tents gathered around bonfires even at noon. One man said ruefully that the one benefit to not having enough tents was that sleeping 10 people per tent at least meant it stayed fairly warm. Iran, with its Islamic government, does not celebrate the Western new year, and the foreigners here said they planned to keep celebrations low-key. ''It is a thrill to be here,'' said Dewey Perks, the battalion chief in the Fairfax County rescue squad. And his New Year's celebration? ''We are going to open a bottle of Crystal Geyser spring water.''"
"Three-year-old Vida was brought here to the Kermanian Orphanage, 75 miles north of Bam, on Monday, three days after an early-morning earthquake ripped that city apart. She has not slept, the staff members say, and refuses even to leave her nurse's arms. ''I want my mother,'' she cries, over and over. ''Her name is Farah.'' Vida is one of the 1,200 children the government knows of so far who lost parents in the earthquake. There is also 8-year-old Ali, who will not speak, except to say that he hopes his uncle, who survived, will take him home. Atefeh, 7, spoke nervously to a visitor about her paintings. ''I am from Bam, but it gets bad earthquakes,'' she said, looking at the palm trees in her paintings. A nameless 6-month-old girl with a broken shoulder finally fell asleep after crying for hours. President Mohammad Khatami visited this orphanage, one of three in Kerman, on Monday. Toddlers greeted him with, ''Hello, Daddy.'' ''Look at my car,'' said a little boy, holding up his red plastic car. ''This is my doll,'' said a girl. Rescue workers, no longer searching for survivors, are turning to many other challenges. Among them are the special needs of orphaned children. A team of psychologists and psychiatric workers was sent to the province this week, to help the suddenly parentless begin to cope. There are practical efforts, too, like starting schools in tents. But the pain the children suffer is unfathomable. The children at the orphanage have been bombarded with gifts from well-meaning people, but they react with anger, or apathy. ''All of them come here with serious anxiety problems,'' said Arezoo Hussein Rezai, the orphanage's psychologist. ''They constantly cry, hide under their blankets or refuse to talk.'' Leila Beigi, a psychologist who works with orphans, said it took her three days to learn the identity of one 7-year-old at the Kermanian orphanage. ''I joked with him, tried playing with him, sometimes showed my frustration but he refused to tell me even his name,'' she said. Some older children simply leave, said Dr. Reza Khoshnood, the vice president of Kerman's Welfare Organization for social affairs. But many return. ''Every day we are sending several of the teenagers back to Bam with our own cars because they want to go and find their homes,'' he said. ''They come back a little calmer after they see there is nothing to go back to.'' The quake's death toll, now at an uncertain 30,000, included an uncounted number of children. But surprising stories are emerging about some who survived. The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that two brothers were pulled from under the rubble on Wednesday, after rescue workers were attracted to the spot by the singing of two canaries. And according to television reports, a 5-year-old girl took food and water to an 11-year-old boy who was buried up to his chest in debris, keeping him alive until rescue workers dug him out on Tuesday. There are stories at the orphanages, too, but many of the children are too traumatized to tell them. An exception, Motahar Norouzi, 14, at Moaven Nassri, said she spent five hours trapped on her bed under rubble. ''I kept on screaming the first few hours, but I was breathing with difficulty by the time they got me out,'' she said. Strong family ties are the norm here in southern Iran, and there are hopes that relatives will claim many orphans. Hundreds of people come every day to Kerman's orphanages looking for children they know. Nosrat Amarian, 20, has not been able to find her 4-year-old nephew. Orphanage workers have promised to look for him at hospitals around the country, since thousands of victims were flown elsewhere for treatment. Some 70 percent of the children who have arrived since the earthquake have already gone home with a relative. ''Relatives insist to take the children but we know from past experiences in other earthquakes that some 30 percent of them return them,'' Mr. Khoshnood said. ''That is when our hard job begins.''"
"Before they went to Bam, before the huge earthquake left them bleeding and choking on thick dust, trapped under the wreckage of their mud brick guest house, Tobb Dell'Oro told Adele Freedman that he was not going to buy her a diamond ring to mark their engagement. He seemed to change his mind in the pitch-black silence beneath the rubble, where the couple could not see each other or even move, where their only physical contact was touching the tip of one finger across the hours it took to dig them out. ''He asked what kind of ring I wanted, how big I wanted it,'' said Ms. Freedman, weeping Sunday in the Tehran hospital bed where she has spent the last eight days with fractures in her feet and ankles. ''I told him it didn't matter, just get us out of here.'' A rescue party organized by their energetic tour guide, Farzaneh Khademi, eventually extracted the couple. Ms. Freedman, 39, survived, traveling 600 miles in a series of nightmarish car rides and hospital stops that eventually landed her in one of Iran's best private hospitals. Mr. Dell'Oro, 41, did not. The strapping 6-foot-2-inch engineer was speaking when they pulled him out, but was bleeding heavily from a wound in his upper chest, pierced perhaps by a ceiling fan. He died in an ambulance along the roughly 150-mile ride to the nearest functioning hospital in a town called Mahan. Ms. Freedman, who expects to travel Monday to her family's home in Great Neck, N.Y., learned about her fiancé's death when her parents, Philip and Annamae, arrived here two days ago and told her. Ms. Khademi and the diplomats from the Swiss Embassy who handle United States affairs in Tehran had been too worried about the shock to tell her, suggesting instead that he had been lost in the post-earthquake bedlam. It was all adventure travel run seriously amok, not what the couple anticipated when first drawn together by shared dreams of the exotic. Lying in her hospital bed, Ms. Freedman whirled through all their fateful decisions. First was the decision to come to Iran after delaying it for many years. Then came the decision to stay in the little nine-room Akbar Guest House in the center of Bam, rather than the characterless modern hotel on the outskirts where they had reservations. Finally, there was Mr. Dell'Oro's insistence that they take the room with a window, just in case a fire erupted or something, rather than the room with no window that emerged unscathed. ''Oh, Mommy, I feel like we made so many bad decisions,'' Ms. Freedman sobbed, her mother rushing over to comfort her. ''You didn't make any bad decisions, Adele, it's not your fault at all, never think that,'' her mother soothed. It started in June 1998, when the couple met at a party near San Francisco. She was living in Mountain View, working in a small corporate law firm; he lived in Redwood City, running a telecommunications market research company with his sister. Both of them had graduated from Cornell University in the mid-1980's, but never crossed paths. They struck up a conversation about wanting to travel to Bhutan. Mr. Dell'Oro expressed amazement that he had met a woman who knew where Bhutan was, but did not ask for her number. He finally got in contact that fall, just as she was starting treatment for rectal cancer. She did not expect him to stick around. Instead, he would leave work to come lift her out of bed when she was too weak. To celebrate the end of her treatment, they traveled. It was mostly exotic destinations -- Laos and Cambodia and Morocco -- but there were occasional romantic weeks in places like Bordeaux. ''We were always looking for a little bit of adventure, history and someplace where it wouldn't be expected to go,'' she said. Walking down the Champs-_lysées in Paris in April 2000, they spotted an Iran Air office and Mr. Dell'Oro wondered aloud if that might be a destination. They went in to ask and were assured they could go, that Ms. Freedman just needed to add a scarf to the coat she was wearing and she would be within the rules for hejab, or modest dress. Mr. Dell'Oro grew up in Saudi Arabia and had taken a couple of childhood vacations in Iran. He wanted to see it again. ''I was afraid it would be dangerous,'' Ms. Freedman said. ''I am Jewish, and I was a little afraid of that. I was a little afraid of the hejab and running afoul of those laws.'' After discovering that the clothing strictures were not so bad, she agreed. She thought they would at least be safe from bombings. Mr. Dell'Oro was in his element in Iran. He hated the American view of the region, he told his fiancée, often writing his congressman to object to American policy there. In the bazaars, he ran around with a little Persian phrase book and opened it at random to read the first sentence he found, drawing big laughs from the Iranians. After reaching Bam on Christmas Day, they explored its ancient citadel that once dominated the Silk Road. ''You could close your eyes and imagine what life was like 2,000 years ago,'' said Ms. Freedman, smiling at the memory of what had been the largest adobe structure on earth. The earthquake jolted the town at dawn, killing about one-third of the 97,000 residents. Ms. Freedman tried to get out of bed but her legs were pinned on the floor by rubble, her face stuck in her pillow. Mr. Dell'Oro made it out of his twin bed and was coming toward her when the ceiling fell. ''The first thing he said was 'Help me Adele, help me,' and I should have known then he was really badly hurt because he wanted to save me, he wasn't the kind of person who asked for help,'' she remembered. Eventually they heard Ms. Khademi, their tour guide, calling their names and Mr. Dell'Oro answered, ''Baleh, baleh'' -- yes in Persian. Ms. Khademi had raced in from the hotel outside town but needed time to find volunteers to dig. The weight on the couple began to ease. Ms. Freedman said she screamed and hit the man pulling her out because of the pain in her legs. Moved into a car, Ms. Freedman could not see without her glasses, but she could hear Mr. Dell'Oro saying the bleeding had to be stopped. He was transferred to an ambulance, and she thought he was heading for surgery. Ms. Khademi was at his side in the emergency room in Mahan, telling the doctor she would give her own blood. The doctor lifted Mr. Dell'Oro's eyelids and told her gently that there was no point, Ms. Khademi said. In the meantime, Ms. Freedman had been carried from one hallway to the next. A passing doctor saw her foot turned completely around and wrenched it back into place. She was again afraid to say she was American, but everyone she encountered offered what help they could, she said, emphasizing that everyone had treated them kindly. The Iranian government has said it will pay her medical costs. Ms. Freedman had hoped to travel home with Mr. Dell'Oro's body, or at least go to the morgue in Tehran to see him, touch him one last time. But the logistics proved too difficult. ''I felt like I did not say goodbye,'' she said through tears. ''I was just screaming at him not to die.''"
"For the first time since Mount St. Helens awakened three weeks ago with earthquake rumblings and several bursts of ash and steam, new lava has pushed through to the surface, geologists reported yesterday. Scientists flying around the crater on Monday spotted a light gray fin-shaped slab of rock, about 200 feet long and 60 feet high, that was not there the day before. Infrared measurements put the temperature of the new rock at 900 to 1,100 degrees. ''Our consensus is there is new magma that has now breached the surface,'' said Dr. Jon J. Major, a geologist with the United States Geological Survey. Small earthquakes started shaking on Sept. 23 around St. Helens, in Washington, which had not erupted since 1986. The first of several emissions of steam and ash shot out of the volcano's crater on Oct. 1. After a largely quiet week, earthquakes resumed over the weekend, leading to new bursts of steam from the volcano on Sunday and Monday. Geologists do not expect the current eruptions to lead to anything similar to the cataclysmic eruption on May 18, 1980, which killed 57 people and blew off the top 1,300 feet of the mountain. Instead, the current activity resembles smaller eruptions that followed, which built up a lava dome about 925 feet high and half a mile wide inside the crater. In recent weeks, the crater floor near the southern part of the lava dome has been pushed up more than 330 feet by rising magma. That is also the location of the steam emissions and the new lava extrusion. ''We are in a period that we are comfortable calling renewed lava dome growth,'' said Dr. Tina Neal of the geological survey. She said the activity was likely to grow and ebb over the coming days, months and perhaps even years. Scientists still do not know how much molten rock has risen into the volcano or even exactly where it is, although they suspect much of it is within half a mile of the surface. More explosive eruptions could still occur, Dr. Neal said, adding: ''We could see an escalation of unrest come on very rapidly, and this could occur without much warning. ''This is the reason we're going to be watching the volcano as closely as we can.''"
"Enduring near-freezing temperatures, thousands of residents of northern Japan camped outdoors Sunday night, unnerved by a day of aftershocks from the nation's deadliest earthquake in nearly a decade, a violent jolt that killed 23 people, injured 2,100 and left seven missing. The weekend's earthquakes came as Japan was cleaning up from last week's typhoon, the most lethal storm in two decades, which killed 80 people. On Sunday, military helicopters flew over a landscape of crumpled highways and collapsed houses, ferrying survivors from mountain villages cut off by Saturday night's earthquake, which had a magnitude of 6.8. In one section of Ojiya, the epicenter, helicopter pilots were drawn to an ''SOS'' message drawn on a road, where quake survivors had been cut off by landslides. ''Our lifeline has been cut,'' Toshiro Hosoya, 57, a high school teacher in Ojiya, later told Reuters. ''There is no toilet, gas or electricity and it was cold last night. I'm not terrified. But the aftershocks keep coming, so I have a strange feeling of unease.'' Monday morning at dawn a tremor registering a magnitude of 5.6 shook northern Japan, knocking down a house in Niigata and sending vibrations all the way to Tokyo. Yoshitaka Murata, Japan's disaster management minister, flew over the mountainous section of Niigata Prefecture, about 125 miles north of Tokyo, and told reporters, ''I saw tremendous landslides in the mountains from a helicopter.'' Largely confined to Niigata, the quake caused 52 landslides, damaged or cut roads in 211 places, and damaged or destroyed 1,206 commercial or public buildings and at least 2,583 homes, according to Japan's National Police Agency. On the ground in Ojiya, land under a rail line had caved in, forming a crater-like hole and leaving train tracks dangling in the air. Television footage showed overturned cars scattered around a 33-foot crater carved from a shattered highway. The city, a textile center of 40,000, had the region's highest death toll, losing nine residents, including three children who died when their house collapsed. In addition, more than 120 residents needed medical treatment for injuries. The quake, the first of a rolling series of seven during a two-hour period Saturday evening, cut power to about one million people and caused the government to remove about 67,000 to shelters. Piped gas, a major source of fires after past earthquakes, was cut to more than 50,000 households in Niigata Prefecture. With authorities warning that another major earthquake could happen within the next week, many people spurned shelters, sleeping in their cars or camping on mattresses in open areas, relying on blankets, bonfires or portable oil heaters. The shocks derailed most of a Shinkansen bullet train, the first derailing of a high-speed train since the bullet train system was inaugurated in 1964. There were no injuries among the 150 passengers, even though the train was traveling 125 miles an hour at the time of the quake. Because the train was close to the epicenter, an automatic early warning system did not work, Masaki Ogata, managing director of JR East, the rail line, told reporters. Because of landslides, damaged concrete structures and undulating track, authorities have closed an 80-mile section of the line from Tokyo to Niigata. To reduce Niigata's isolation, Japan's two major airlines, Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways, on Sunday started temporary service from Tokyo to the city, which is on the Sea of Japan. Parts of three expressways were closed because of crumbled overpasses, a collapsed highway tunnel and cave-ins on many secondary roads. Further hampering communications, the quake damaged 80 cellphone towers. ''There were four to five jolts so strong we couldn't keep standing without grabbing something like a desk,'' Toshio Kasuga, an official in Takayanagi, told Kyodo News. ''I saw some landslides on a hillside on my way to the office.'' One young man from Mitsuke told NHK television, ''I ran outside, and when I looked at buildings, they were shaking like pudding.'' On Sunday, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said the quake ''must be beyond our imagination in terms of fear and damage.'' He said he would take extra budgetary measures in response to the quakes. Japan is one of the world's most seismically active areas. Memories are still vivid of the Kobe earthquake, which killed 6,433 people and injured 43,700 in January 1995. That quake had a magnitude of 7.3."
"Four days had passed since a powerful earthquake touched off a rock slide here, entombing a mother and her two children in their crumpled white van. On Wednesday, braving frequent earth tremors, firefighters finally crossed the unstable landslide and sent a probe into the wreckage. They detected a groan. All Japan stopped to watch. Throughout the afternoon television networks broadcast live images of a human chain of white-helmeted and orange-suited men. In a moonscape of massive gray boulders, they worked quietly and gingerly, keeping their nerves steady amid tremors that kept camera angles jumping. Finally, after 31 dead and over 3,500 injured, Japan had something to cheer for. Passed from hand to hand, there was tiny, mud-stained Yuta Minagawa. Wide-eyed before the cameras, the 2-year-old boy croaked dryly, ''Mama.'' A few miles away, applause rippled across the hardwood floor of the Kagi Elementary School gymnasium, a steel-ribbed structure where dozens of families have camped since the earthquake struck during last Saturday's dinner hour, teaching people a harsh lesson about life's fragility atop the earth's crust. On the stage, underneath basketball nets, a television transmitted the rescue taking place across town. ''When the boy was rescued, people here clapped,'' Fumie Nagai said, steadying her squirming grandson, Kaito. ''It became a hope to everyone. You know, that boy is the same age as ours.'' Deeper into the hills, people at a village of cracked houses and shattered confidence were preparing for another night of listening to rescue helicopters grinding overhead, another night spent sleeping in the steel cocoons of their cars. Gathered in a tent with friends, Toshiko Iwafuchi, 62, had followed the rescue on a battery-powered radio. ''Everyone became so happy to hear that a boy was rescued alive,'' she said, as she and her 8-year-old grandson, Futa, prepared to go to sleep in their car. ''I was almost crying when I heard the news.'' Four days after the earthquake, Japan, a rich nation long accustomed to generously giving foreign aid to others, now finds itself accepting emergency donations from South Korea and the United States. In a blow to national pride, a derailed bullet train is stranded along a track section here, the first derailment of the fabled Shinkansen since high-speed service began for the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics. Every day, newspapers fill with dramatic images that Japan, a comfortably middle-class nation, would normally associate with a faraway, poor country: a soldier carrying an elderly woman piggyback into an evacuation helicopter, tent cities filling school playgrounds, families filling shelters with all of their belongings in plastic bags. ''It is unlikely that anyone envisioned a scenario in which this society, abounding in affluence and convenience, could be smashed by a natural disaster to the point that a number of people must share a single rice ball,'' the financial daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun said in an editorial. At last count, 103,000 people around here were sleeping in 486 officially sponsored shelters. An estimated thousands were spending the night in their cars or in their garages, ready to bolt at a moment's notice. According to the National Police Agency, the four days of quakes and tremors have destroyed 395 houses and partly damaged 3,473 more. Unquantifiable is the deep loss of confidence here in any above-ground structure. ''Hurry, get out, now!'' Fusa Kawakami, 59, commanded, cutting short a tour of her devastated kitchen and torn rice paper screens as a midafternoon tremor suddenly set the third floor of her seemingly solid house creaking and swaying. At least 450 tremors have been felt since the first seven shocks that came in quick succession on Saturday evening. A few minutes earlier Mrs. Kawakami had been relaxing with her husband, Tetsuo, in what he called ''our new living room/dining room'' -- their concrete-walled garage. Along with a huge plastic water bottle and a powerful flashlight, it now featured the makings for tea and snacks, neatly arrayed on a white tablecloth laid out on the flatbed of their pickup truck. Asked if he normally wore his white hard hat in his living room, Mr. Kawakami, who owns a steam boiler company, laughed and said the best feature of his new living room was that it was only a step from the sidewalk, a step that he and his wife took Wednesday morning when a tremor registering a magnitude of 6 hit here with such a jolt that it was felt in Tokyo, about 150 miles to the southeast. ''This is not like a typhoon -- no one can say when it will end,'' he said, repeating official forecasts that tremors could shake northern Japan for weeks to come. Pointing to a traffic light, its lenses dead and its pole tilting at a crazy angle, he said, ''That happened yesterday.'' Down the road, an undulating ribbon of asphalt, drivers carefully straddled yawning six-inch-wide cracks and steered around new depressions and upheavals. Many of the houses seemed to be in good shape, but growing roadside mountains of plastic bags of trash spoke of interior chaos. As one trash pile grew near the green shoots of a rice paddy, Seiichi Yamasaki, 57, joked that earthquakes were provoking spring cleaning in the fall. As a carpenter working on his house grimly dumped trash bags with ominous clatters of broken glass, Mr. Yamasaki continued with his bravado, noting that normally in Japan people have to pay a recycling tax to dispose of a large household appliance. ''Now you can take a hammer to an old television, say it was the earthquake and get rid of it free,'' he said, grinning at this silver lining. During a 10-minute roadside conversation, two tremors hit, causing his two-story house to creak and groan, but not so strongly as to prompt his wife to suspend her cleanup chores. As night fell and mountain temperatures descended toward freezing, the afternoon glow of the rescue of Japan's ''miracle child,'' seem to fade. Little Yuta's mother, Takako Minagawa, 39, was finally pulled from the wreckage. But she was dead, apparently killed in the initial crash. Rescuers soon suspended work on extricating Yuta's 3-year-old sister, Mayu. According to the Kyodo new agency, firefighters reported that they could see her legs. But she did not respond to calls, and showed no vital signs. Mother and daughter now raise the death toll to 33."
"For the fifth straight day, Mount St. Helens let out a burst of steam and ash yesterday, similar to the earlier bursts that have risen out of the crater and perhaps larger. But with that exhalation, the volcano dozed off, and the earthquakes that have shaken the area in Washington State almost continually for two weeks stopped almost entirely. ''The seismicity dropped off quite dramatically,'' said Dr. Steve Malone, the director of the seismology lab at the University of Washington. The earthquakes began Sept. 23, when Mount St. Helens began to revive, and gradually increased in intensity and pace, culminating in an eruption of steam and ash on Friday, the first eruption since 1986. The earthquakes tailed off briefly but returned in an hour or two and became stronger. On Saturday, at the peak of seismic unrest, three to four quakes a minute shook St. Helens, with the larger ones, between magnitude 2 and magnitude 3, occurring every couple of minutes. After yesterday's steam burst, the larger earthquakes ceased completely, and the pace of the smaller ones, almost all below magnitude 1, slowed to one or two per minute. ''That is an indication perhaps that it's running out of energy,'' William Steele, another seismologist at the University of Washington, said. ''Maybe it's accomplished what it's going to do.'' So far, Mount St. Helens has done relatively little compared with the months leading up to its cataclysmic 1980 eruption. Then, a large bulge formed on the volcano's northern flank, rising five feet a day. By May 18, 1980, the bulge had been pushed upward and outward by more than 450 feet when a magnitude-5.1 earthquake hit, and the bulge collapsed in a landslide. That, in effect, took the lid off the magma underground, and later that day, Mount St. Helens explosively erupted, killing 57 people. This time, global positioning system sensors detect no movement on the volcano's outer flanks. The only deformation is within St. Helens' mile-wide crater, on the southern side of a lava dome that built up during smaller eruptions from 1980 to 1986. Over the last two weeks, that part of the dome has cracked as it has been lifted about 100 feet. Infrared images have detected spots on the dome 35 to 70 degrees warmer than the surrounding rock, said Dr. Jacob B. Lowenstern of the United States Geological Survey. The steam eruptions have emanated from beneath a horseshoe-shaped glacier that wraps around the lava dome. The steam has melted a pond about 100 feet wide, the waters roiling with bubbles of hot volcanic gases rising from the magma. Dr. Lowenstern said he doubted that the lull in earthquakes signaled the end of the current episode. ''The magma is still coming up,'' he said. ''I think we expect more of the kinds of explosions that we've seen over the last few days, and it wouldn't be surprising to see more evidence of magma reaching the surface.''"
"A series of powerful earthquakes jolted northern Japan in quick succession Saturday evening, killing at least 16 people and injuring more than 900, according to a preliminary tally by Kyodo News. Television images from Niigata Prefecture showed groups of residents huddling under blankets as they prepared to spend the night in the safety of open squares. Nearby, fires burned in blacked out neighborhoods, glass littered sidewalks from shattered shop windows and cars eased slowly over one highway section buckled by one of the seven quakes. The most powerful registered 6.8 in magnitude, one of the strongest in recent decades, according to Japan Meteorological Agency. The vertical and horizontal shocks caused houses to collapse and derailed a Shinkansen bullet train for the first time. About 42,000 residents were evacuated throughout the prefecture. The strong temblors were also felt in Tokyo, where Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was giving a speech to open the Tokyo International Film Festival. The Prime Minister did not skip a beat and there was no panic. Of the more than 16 people killed, four were children, including three who died when their house collapsed in Ojiya, close to the epicenter. Two men died when concrete walls collapsed on them. A total of 120 people were injured in Ojiya, 84 in Tokamachi, about 300 in Nagaoka, about 50 in Kashiwazaki and more than 160 in other towns and villages as of early Sunday morning , according to a Kyodo News tally based on police, government and hospital reports. Blackouts affected about one million people. Piped gas, a source of major fires after past earthquakes, was cut to more than 40,000 households in Niigata Prefecture. Parts of three expressways were closed, and many side roads suffered cave-ins. Although a bullet train partially derailed in Niigata, there were no injuries among the 150 passengers. It was the first time the train had been derailed since services began in 1964, according to the Transport Ministry. Through the chilly night, emergency workers searched through collapsed houses, searching for at least four people believed to have been in their homes at dinner time. The first quake hit at 5:56 p.m., with its focus 12 miles below ground in the Chuetsu region in Niigata Prefecture. During the next two hours, residents were affected by six more quakes. Japan is one of the world's most seismically active areas, recording about 20 percent of the world's earthquakes of magnitude six or greater. Memories are still vivid of the Kobe earthquake, which killed more than 6,400 people in 1995. That quake measured 7.2. The earthquakes came as Japan has been cleaning up from last week's typhoon, the deadliest in two decades, which killed 80 people."
"When the Northridge earthquake devastated Los Angeles County in 1994, St. John's Health Center, a private Catholic hospital in this seaside community, suffered such extensive damage that an entire wing had to be torn down. The most severely damaged of the 23 hospitals that had to suspend some or all services after the quake, St. John's was forced to close for nine months. In early December, however, St. John's will begin admitting patients to a sleek new arc-shaped building that is designed to withstand an earthquake with twice the force of Northridge, which had a magnitude of 6.7. The new four-story North Pavilion, expected to cost more than $315 million, is part of a 15-year construction program that is intended to modernize the 62-year-old hospital, give it a more efficient layout that will be easier to navigate, and provide patients with some of the comforts of an elegant hotel. The new building has light-filled private rooms equipped with 42-inch plasma television sets and upholstered window seats that allow visitors to nap or stay overnight. Nurses' stations are scattered throughout the floor to be closer to the rooms. A multibillion-dollar hospital construction boom is under way in this state, a response to new seismic safety building codes and deadlines established in the aftermath of the earthquake. In 2001, state officials found that 40 percent of the state's 479 hospitals were in danger of collapsing in a major earthquake and 75 percent did not have adequate bracing to keep their mechanical and other systems operating. In the 1994 earthquake, most of the serious damage occurred at hospital buildings constructed before 1971, when an earthquake centered in Sylmar, Calif., destroyed a newly built hospital and led to the first tightening of seismic standards. Initially, the seismic legislation required all acute-care inpatient buildings that would be at risk during a strong earthquake to be rebuilt, retrofitted or closed by 2008, but hospitals may now apply for extensions up to 2013, and about one-third have already done so, said Kurt A. Schaefer, a deputy director of the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, which has approval power over the building plans. By 2030, however, all hospitals in the state must be not only structurally sound but also be able to care for patients after a disaster. Rather than embark on costly retrofitting, many hospital administrators determined that it made more sense to rebuild from scratch, particularly if federal disaster help was available. Officials of the California Healthcare Association, the hospital industry's trade organization, once estimated that the state's rebuilding program would cost $24 billion. Now the group says the price tag will be much higher, in part because of the rising cost of building materials. To some extent, the frenzied pace of hospital construction in California mirrors a national trend. ''This is the strongest health care construction market I've ever seen,'' said Robert D. Levine, the manager of the Turner Construction Company's national health care group; Mr. Levine has spent 40 years in the business. Turner is currently engaged in 125 medical projects -- including a $400 million joint venture with URS, a construction services company with headquarters in San Francisco, for work at U.C.L.A. -- twice the volume of five years ago. Mr. Levine said health care projects are helping to offset the nationwide slowdown in office construction and accounted for 17.2 percent of his company's business in 2003, compared with 8.8 percent in 1999. Low interest rates and the aging stock of hospital buildings have helped fuel this growth spurt. Many hospital buildings date to the wave of hospital construction in the two decades after World War II and are not well suited to today's technology. Today's operating rooms, for example, have to be one-third larger than they were before, Mr. Levine said. With baby boomers also aging, many new hospitals are anticipating a growing demand for health care. And many are also moving to the suburbs from urban neighborhoods. No state is building as many replacement hospital buildings as California, where architecture and design firms, construction companies and subcontractors are being stretched to the limit, real estate specialists say. Construction companies are teaming up to minimize the risk that goes with developing complex projects costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Steve Mynsberge, a senior vice president for health care for the McCarthy Building Companies, said his company, which is based in St. Louis, is involved in 10 hospital projects in California. Among them is a $498 million joint venture with the Clark Construction Company of Costa Mesa and Hunt Construction Group of Phoenix to construct four buildings at the Los Angeles County and University of Southern California Medical Center. Officials of the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development said they did not know just how many new hospital buildings were planned. ''We're definitely at historic levels in terms of workload,'' said Paul A. Coleman, the deputy division chief for Los Angeles and Orange Counties. The officials estimated that hospitals across the state were spending $4.6 billion to meet the seismic requirements, with Mr. Coleman's territory accounting for well over half of that. Construction companies estimate that seismic strengthening adds 10 to 20 percent to the cost of a building's structural frame, according to a 2002 report by the Rand Corporation, a research organization that is based in Santa Monica. At the new St. John's building, for example, about $20 million was spent on something called a base isolation system, in which 80 plates made of rubber, steel and lead sit between the support columns and U-shaped piers that are deeply embedded in the ground. The idea is to damp the effect of an earthquake and let the building sway gently over the energy waves instead of being whipped from side to side. Similar technology is being installed at one of the four new buildings that Los Angeles County-U.S.C. Medical Center is building at the base of a hillside in East Los Angeles, just south of the existing Depression-era main building made famous by the soap opera ''General Hospital.'' But structural reinforcement is only one way a hospital must protect itself. At U.C.L.A.'s Westwood campus, where construction has started on a $400 million, 1.3 million-square-foot hospital building designed by I.M. Pei, a portion of the highly complex latticework of pipes, ducts, tubes and cables that are required to brace all of the building's mechanical systems can still be seen. More than 100 people were needed to coordinate the installation of systems to provide plumbing, medical gases, electricity, fire protection, pneumatic tubing and telecommunications, which occupy as much as seven feet of space above the ceiling, said the project director, Randall E. Hight, a vice president at Marelich Mechanical, a subsidiary of the Emcor Group. ''We had to make sure we weren't running into each other,'' he said. ''It took more than a year.'' In the intensive-care unit, a light fixture weighing 22 pounds is secured by 500 pounds of steel bracing, said Bert Hurlburt, a construction manager. Hospitals that were damaged in the earthquake, like County-U.S.C., U.C.L.A.'s two medical campuses and St. John's, were able to get significant financing from federal and state disaster agencies for their construction projects. And some, like St. John's, were able to draw on substantial reserve funds and raise big sums from celebrity patients and other private donors. The hospital's new nursery, named for Maria Shriver, was a gift from her husband, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, said Bruce Lamoureux, the chief executive. But for many hospitals, especially those in rural and poor urban neighborhoods that lack borrowing power, the seismic requirements -- which did not have government funds attached to them -- could not have come at a worse time, officials of the California Healthcare Association said. More than half the state's hospitals are operating at deficits, and nearly one-third are facing bankruptcy, said Jan Emerson, a spokeswoman for the trade group. Other mandates, like a prescribed ratio of nurses to patients, have further burdened a system that was already struggling with low reimbursement rates and one of the highest proportions of uninsured residents in the nation, she said. The state has been grappling with its own severe budget shortfall, which has also interfered with the hospitals' rebuilding plans. The health planning and development office is financed by a tax on hospital construction, but it was subject to the hiring freeze that was imposed throughout state government. (The agency has recently begun hiring, Mr. Schaefer said.) A shortage of inspectors and the high level of scrutiny imposed by the development agency has caused delays and added to construction costs, which are now estimated at $450 a square foot or more, construction managers say. Subcontractors are charging more because they do not know what to expect in the future, said Mr. Mynsberge, the McCarthy executive. ''Everybody looks at these hospital projects as very high risk because of all the scrutiny and the consequences that brings,'' he said. ''That risk could be a company killer.'' COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE"
"Five years ago, I had 24 hours' notice to fly to Colombia. An earthquake had registered 6.2 on the Richter scale near the city of Armenia. There were safety warnings from the State Department. And because I was carrying information to give the country's president, I was a target for a possible kidnapping. I was escorted through customs by two armed guards who were representatives of the Colombian government. I had to have trust and faith that the two gentlemen who picked me up were who they said they were. They took me to an unmarked car sitting by the curb just outside the exit and left me at a safe house, a classified hotel. I was instructed not to leave. It was an old building. When I turned on the water to take a shower, hot, smelly, rusty water came through the pipes. I filled the bathroom sink with it, took four liters of bottled water and heated them. I took my shower by pouring the warmed bottled water over my head. The next day I flew to Armenia on a half-filled 15-to-20-seat plane with government workers and I.B.M. employees. One of our jobs was to distribute food to the area's 200,000 residents. The main terminal building had collapsed, so it was unsafe to occupy the building or be anywhere near it. I tried to be emotionally detached when I saw people were living in the streets. I stayed overnight at a tent camp set up by Mexico. My accommodations were standard army issue. We slept on cots. There was a community kitchen. The next day, another I.B.M. executive and I were picked up by a military escort and taken back to the airport. We were going to meet a general and his entourage and return to Bogotá on a military transport plane. We stood with the two armed guards on the tarmac for about an hour until the general showed up in the late afternoon. He told the guards to leave and then got on the plane with his entourage. We were waiting for our instructions when the pilot, a colonel, stuck his head out the window and said there was no room to take us. He gunned the engines and flew off, leaving us on the tarmac. My colleague was a Colombian citizen who had dealt with the government for a long time. In English he said: ''I think we're in trouble. Let's get out of here.'' We took off and ran into the jungle surrounding the airport. We didn't have a cellphone or a satellite phone with us. We stayed hidden in the jungle as we worked our way around the perimeter of the airport until we came to a pay phone. My colleague called his government contacts in Bogotá and loudly expressed his concern. For the next two hours, we stood by the phone booth until a small Avianca commuter plane arrived to pick us up. We returned to Bogotá without incident, about 10 or 11 p.m. and ate some empanadas and got some rest. The next day, I went to the presidential palace to brief the first lady and generals. While I was there, I was escorted in to meet the president, who had just announced a temporary truce with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrilla faction. I met the general who was their leader. I never saw the general, who left me on the tarmac, again. After the meeting I returned to the safe house. BUSINESS TRAVEL: FREQUENT FLIER"
"The first rule of making a disaster movie is never cast a close relative of Lloyd Bridges. In ''10.5,'' a two-part mini-series about a huge West Coast earthquake, Beau Bridges plays the president of the United States with the kind of lip-biting valor (''then reschedule the German Ambassador, my people come first, John'') that comes dangerously close to the parodies his father perfected in films like ''Airplane!'' and ''Hot Shots!'' ''10.5,'' on NBC tomorrow night and Monday, is not exactly scary, nor is it quite tongue-in-cheek. It is a purposeful throwback to 1970's-style disaster movies like ''Airport '77'' and ''The Poseidon Adventure,'' movies in which stock characters work out their personal melodramas against backdrops of fire and brimstone. Even the music, swelling thrillingly at every heart-tugging opportunity, has a 70's feel. The only signs that ''10.5'' was made in the 21st century are a few gender-role reversals. The brilliant, arrogant and ostracized scientist who alone grasps the scale of the disaster is a woman, Dr. Samantha Hill (Kim Delaney). The blander, more supportive mate who requires a helping hand on outdoor excursions is a man, Dr. Jordan Fisher (David Cubitt). Other than that, everything is textbook, from the rift between a divorced father and his daughter -- healed under fire (and fissures) -- to the cocky young surgeons who lose their fancy cars but find humility. Even the special effects have a slightly cheesy, retro look. When the Golden Gate Bridge collapses, spilling tiny cars into the San Francisco Bay as if they were cereal pouring out of a box, viewers cannot be blamed for willing Godzilla into view. And that is probably a good thing. Disaster-movie escapism became harder to enjoy after Sept. 11: any scene that depicts hundreds of people crushed under rubble or choking in ash and dust comes too close to reality for comfort. (The only truly disturbing moment in ''10.5'' is fleeting and late in the second half. In a tent city, evacuated Californians tack up hand-drawn fliers and leaflets seeking their loved ones, just as so many New Yorkers did after the destruction of the World Trade Center.) By retracing well-worn steps and hamming it up, ''10.5'' reaches back across painful memories to a hokeyer, more innocent time. There are no real surprises (Malibu is not spared). But there is some pleasure in watching the earth crack and swallow cars, trains and houses. And there is fulfillment in predicting hackneyed dialogue. (''There's no turning back now''; and, a personal favorite, ''You're not a team player.'')

"Hippos at the Beach? Keeping a child protected from the sun while at the beach can be a bother. As the label on the sunscreen bottle says, it is necessary to repeat application after swimming or other activity. With a youngster, that can mean smearing on lotion all day long. How nice it would be, then, if the little ones could borrow a trick from the hippopotamus. For as Japanese researchers have discovered, those river-wallowing beasts produce their own sunscreen in their sweat. The researchers studied the viscous liquid produced by the hippo's subdermal glands; the liquid, they point out, is not technically sweat, but serves the same temperature-controlling purpose. This liquid at first is colorless, but as it dries it takes on a red color that eventually turns to brown as chains of molecules link up. At the Ueno Zoo in Tokyo, the scientists gathered the liquid by rubbing a hippo's face with gauze. They isolated red and orange pigments in the liquid, and through analysis found that they were both aromatic hydrocarbons. What is more, they were both acidic, which is unusual because the liquid itself is alkaline. The researchers, who described their findings in the May 27 issue of the journal Nature, note that the pigments absorb light in the ultraviolet and visible wavelengths, giving them value as sunscreens. They add that the red pigment, which they named hipposudoric acid, may serve as an antibiotic, killing bacteria on the hippo's skin. In laboratory tests at concentrations lower than those found on the animal, it inhibited the growth of certain pathogenic bacteria. Eat Your Cilantro Now if those hippos would just eat some cilantro, they would be all set. Chemists have isolated compounds in that herb that kill salmonella bacteria. Scientists reported last year that salsa has antibacterial properties. But since salsa is a mix of ingredients -- usually tomatoes, onions, chilies and cilantro -- it was not known precisely what was contributing to its ability to inhibit bacterial growth. Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley and the Autonomous University of Guadalajara in Mexico focused on cilantro. Their research was reported in the May 16 issue of The Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. The researchers characterized 13 compounds from cilantro leaves, including 11 that were tested against various pathogenic bacteria, Salmonella choleraesuis among them. All of the compounds showed some bacteria-fighting ability, but one, dodecenal, was particularly effective. The scientists cautioned that it was not certain that the cilantro compound is what gives salsa its antimicrobial qualities. There are many compounds in the other ingredients that might work with dodecenal, or perhaps even against it in some way. But the research points to the possibility of using dodecenal as an additive in some foods to decrease the risk of salmonella poisoning. Earth Rumbles, Geysers Listen A strong earthquake in Alaska in November 2002 set off very small quakes 2,000 miles away, in Yellowstone National Park. That in itself is not unusual; scientists have known for a decade that far-off seismic events can influence local ones. But a study by scientists from the University of Utah and from Yellowstone, and published in the June issue of the journal Geology, shows for the first time that such a distant quake can scramble the park's hydrothermal plumbing and affect its geysers. The scientists say the Alaskan quake caused mineral deposits to come loose, opening up new fissures and allowing more superheated water to move freely. That caused some geysers to erupt more frequently, and others to erupt less often. Penguin Problems Werner Heisenberg may have meant his uncertainty principle to apply only to particle physics. But there is uncertainty in just about all scientific work. That is, the act of measuring or observing something can affect those measurements or observations. Take studies of penguin behavior. For decades, scientists have been banding the birds, attaching numbered metal or plastic strips to their flippers. That has prompted a debate among researchers; some argue that the bands may affect behavior by increasing drag and making it harder for penguins to swim. Now, Dr. Michel Gauthier-Clerc of the National Center for Scientific Research in Strasbourg, France, has provided strong evidence that banding does affect the birds. In a five-year study of king penguins on Possession Island in the southern Indian Ocean, Dr. Gauthier-Clerc and his colleagues showed that banded birds often returned to the colony later than unbanded ones, had a lower probability of breeding and produced fewer offspring. Dr. Gauthier-Clerc, whose study is published in Biology Letters, said it appeared that the impaired swimming affects the birds on critical foraging trips. King penguins normally increase their weight 50 percent on a three-week trip that precedes the November breeding season. ''We think the problem is in body reserves,'' Dr. Gauthier-Clerc said. ''If there are not enough reserves, the penguins can't engage in reproduction.'' To track his 50 banded and 50 unbanded birds, Dr. Gauthier-Clerc used a newer technology, a kind of EZ-Pass for wildlife. Tiny electronic transponders were implanted under the birds' skin, and antennas to pick up the identifying signals were placed near the colony. This technology could easily replace banding in most types of studies, Dr. Gauthier-Clerc said. Although many researchers have abandoned banding for all but short-term studies, a few still practice it for long-term research and are likely to continue doing so, Dr. Gauthier-Clerc acknowledged. ''They'll continue to say there is no effect on their penguins,'' he said. But having shown that bands can affect at least one species, he added, ''at least now we can ask, 'Show us the data.'''

"Two earthquakes shook regions of the United States within hours of each other Monday morning, with one in southeastern Alaska registering a magnitude of 6.7 and the other, in northern Illinois, registering 4.1, according to the United States Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center. The quake in Alaska occurred at 1:49 a.m. Alaska time and was centered beneath the ocean about 230 miles south of Juneau, according to the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center, which recorded a higher preliminary magnitude, 7.0, than the Geological Survey. Shaking was felt in the relatively unpopulated southern Alaska Panhandle, a strip of land sandwiched between British Columbia and the Pacific Ocean, but no injuries or major damage were reported. In Illinois, the smaller earthquake occurred at 1:10 a.m. Central time, the Geological Survey said. It was centered about 75 miles southwest of Chicago but was felt in much of the state as well as in parts of Missouri and Wisconsin. ''It felt like somebody was picking up the bed and shaking it,'' said Gayla Johnson, a secretary at City Hall in Ottawa, Ill., about 10 miles southeast of the quake's epicenter. Mike Jobst, captain of the Ottawa Fire Department, said the quake woke him up along with countless other people who called the Fire Department to report the shaking. ''It was like a very strong vibration,'' Mr. Jobst said. No injuries or damage were reported, he said."
"It was 7 p.m. Seattle time on Dec. 25 when Vasily V. Titov raced to his office, sat down at his computer and prepared to simulate an earthquake and tsunami that was already sweeping across the Indian Ocean. He started from a blank screen and with the muted hope that just maybe he could warn officials across the globe about the magnitude of what was unfolding. But the obstacles were numerous. Two hours had already passed since the quake, and there was no established model of what a tsunami might do in the Indian Ocean. Ninety percent of tsunamis occur in the Pacific, and that was where most research had been done. Dr. Titov, a mathematician who works for a government marine laboratory, began to assemble his digital tools on his computer's hard drive: a three-dimensional map of the Indian Ocean seafloor and the seismic data showing the force, breadth and direction of the earthquake's punch to the sea. As he set to work, Sumatra's shores were already a soup of human flotsam. Thailand to the east was awash. The pulse of energy transferred from seabed to water, traveling at jetliner speed, was already most of the way across the Bay of Bengal and approaching unsuspecting villagers and tourists, fishermen and bathers, from the eight-foot-high coral strands of the Maldives to the teeming shores of Sri Lanka and eastern India. In the end, Dr. Titov could not get ahead of that wave with his numbers. He could not help avert the wreckage and death. But alone in his office, following his computer model of the real tsunami, he began to understand, as few others in the world did at that moment, that this was no local disaster. With an eerie time lag, his data would reveal the dimensions of the catastrophe that was unfolding across eight brutal hours on Sunday, one that stole tens of thousands of lives and remade the coasts of the Asian subcontinent. For those on the shores of the affected countries, the reckoning with the tsunami's power came all but out of the blue, and cost them their lives. It began near a corner of the island of Sumatra, and ended 3,000 miles away on the East African shore. For the scientists in Hawaii, at the planet's main tsunami center, who managed to send out one of the rare formal warnings, there was intense frustration. They had useful information; they were trained to get word out; but they were stymied by limitations, including a lack of telephone numbers for counterparts in other countries. For Colleen McGinn, a disaster relief worker in Melbourne, Australia, the developing crisis would send her off on an aid mission that she could not have comprehended and that United Nations officials have projected to be the greatest relief effort ever mounted. For others like Phil Cummins, an Australian seismologist, what was happening made all too much sense. He had grasped the dangers a year earlier, and in 2004 had delivered a Powerpoint presentation to tsunami experts in Japan and Hawaii. ''It really seems strange now to see the title,'' Dr. Cummins recalled yesterday. ''Tsunami in the Indian Ocean -- Why should we care?'' Hawaii: Helpless Warners He wore two beepers, in case one failed. Both chirped. It was a languorous Christmas afternoon, with his girlfriend away and nothing to do, and Barry Hirshorn, 48, was asleep. As a geophysicist, he was used to having his rest interrupted. Almost daily, earthquakes announced themselves somewhere, usually modest nuisances, and off went his pagers. It was just after 3 p.m. in Honolulu, nearly halfway around the globe from where the earth was trembling. Mr. Hirshorn worked at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, a stubby cinderblock structure set in a weedy plain in Ewa Beach. He was one of five staff scientists entrusted with the big task of alerting Pacific countries and the United States military to deadly tsunamis. ''I knew it wasn't tiny,'' he said. ''Probably over a 6.'' The messages on his beepers indicated alerts from two far-apart seismic monitoring stations, meaning the quake had power. Shrugging into a shirt, he hopped onto his ''duty bike,'' and pedaled the several hundred yards to the center, operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Stuart Weinstein, 43, was already at a terminal in the windowless operations room, staring at the thick blue seismic lines that signaled an ''event.'' ''This is a big earthquake,'' he recalled thinking. ''Maybe a 7.'' Dr. Weinstein began pinpointing the location. Sliding into the seat beside him, Mr. Hirshorn waited to calculate the magnitude. Within minutes, they concluded it was a quake of 8.0 magnitude. More data arrived, and they reworked their calculations. But they stayed with 8.0. At 3:14 p.m., 15 minutes after the earthquake struck, they issued a routine bulletin announcing an event off Sumatra with a magnitude of 8.0. It added, ''There is no tsunami warning or watch in effect.'' This referred to the Pacific. The bulletin alerted perhaps 26 countries, including Indonesia and Thailand, though it did not go to other coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, for they were not part of any warning system. Next, the men tackled a slower but more precise means to measure an earthquake, using waves that pierce the earth's mantle rather than simply the initial waves. They got an 8.5, a marked difference in possible threat. ''Uh oh,'' Dr. Weinstein said. It was 3:45 and time to call the boss: Dr. Charles McCreery stood in a friend's living room a few miles away, delivering a gift after a brunch at his sister-in-law's. His 4-year-old twin daughters were hoping that he would soon assemble their new bicycles. Dr. McCreery, 54, said a fresh bulletin should go out, reporting the higher magnitude and mentioning the chance of a tsunami near the epicenter. But he and his colleagues doubted that an 8.5 quake would unleash a far-ranging ''teletsunami'' that could traverse an ocean and wipe out villages. Once the second bulletin left, at 4:04 p.m., there was little more that their machines could confide, unless tsunamis crossed the Indian Ocean and entered the Pacific. They had no sea monitors in the Indian Ocean. Dr. Weinstein scrolled the Internet. They tuned in CNN on television. Only in the same way that most of the world learned, from news reports, did the three men come to see the ghastly reality, the widening tsunami paths and the lethal coastal destruction. A wire dispatch at 5:30 told them that Sri Lanka had been pounded. Their spirits drooped. ''More are going to die,'' Mr. Hirshorn said. Their instinct was to somehow tell more, to warn the region that it would continue, to reach people who could clear beaches. But how? Mr. Hirshorn recalled a tsunami expert he knew in Australia, called and got an answering machine. He left a message. Someone phoned the International Tsunami Information Center, asking if they knew people in the stricken region. The center simply had no contacts in this distant world. At 7:25, an e-mail message from Harvard's seismology group reckoned the earthquake at 8.9. Now they understood why such a monster tsunami had been unleashed. They continued to scramble to reach countries that could still escape death, but they were reaching into a void. Around 10:15 p.m., they did speak to the United States embassies in Mauritius and Madagascar, which promised to warn Somalia and Kenya, not yet hit, but it is unclear what came of this. Their day ended, engulfed in gloom. ''Part of me said I wish it had occurred in the Pacific, because we could have saved an awful lot of people,'' Dr. Weinstein said. ''We felt terrible that we couldn't get the messages to where they were most needed.'' Japan: Looking On The seismograph at the Matsushiro Seismological Observatory, about 110 miles northwest of Tokyo, is buried inside a mountain tunnel. The tunnel had first been created as an alternative headquarters for the country's imperial military during the final years of the war in the Pacific, and scientists saw it had advantages for recording as precisely as possible tremors in the earth: protection from the effects of temperature and wind. ''Our job is to identify the epicenter and the size of earthquakes all over the world,'' said Masashi Kobayashi, an official at the observatory. ''There are many observatories recording the earthquakes in the vicinity of Japan, but this observatory is the only one in Japan for observing the earthquakes of the world.'' And Mr. Kobayashi said he did not mistake the significance of what got recorded deep inside the mountain on Sunday. ''I got surprised,'' he said. The recording showed an earthquake with a magnitude of 8. ''In the vicinity of Japan,'' he said, ''that size is recorded only once in several years to 10 years.'' Mr. Kobayashi said he had calculated the location, as well as the magnitude of the quake. ''I reported it is west of Sumatra island, including the latitude and longitude,'' he said. And with that, he said, he realized something else. ''When I found it was in the ocean,'' he said, ''I thought the first thing to worry about was a tsunami.'' There has been over the last several days, as the death count from the earthquake and tsunami has steadily climbed to more than 100,000, much discussion of whether enough was done by scientists and government officials around the world to relay word of the possible peril millions of people suddenly faced. There have been accounts in newspapers of officials in Indonesia and Thailand and Malaysia struggling to comprehend the threat and get out warnings. All agree that, whatever people's intentions or capabilities, no sufficient warnings were transmitted that might have limited the toll at some of the hardest-hit places. What Mr. Kobayashi did with his information, and concern, is not entirely clear. In an interview, he said he had made his reports to headquarters. It is not clear what, if anything, his superiors did. Asked directly if he thought his reports led to any movement toward issuing a warning about a tsunami, Mr. Kobayashi said, ''My job is to decide the size and the location of the earthquake epicenter, so it is beyond my job to answer that question.'' Indonesia: First Losses As deputy mayor of Banda Aceh, Aceh Province's most bustling town, Muhammad Kadir was about the closest thing the townspeople had to an alarm bell when the tsunami hit Indonesia. Elected to office as an elder statesman of sorts, the 76-year-old Mr. Kadir had hurried Sunday morning to a seaside market at the tip of the island of Sumatra for emergency supplies after the initial earthquake struck. It was at the market, a few minutes later, that he said he had looked far out to sea and noticed something strange: the waterline was dipping off to the sides and rising furiously in the middle. ''The water separated, then it attacked,'' he said. ''I've never even seen anything like it in the movies. I couldn't imagine anything like it.'' After spotting the raging waters, Mr. Kadir raced through the town banging on doors and shouting into a local mosque. ''I told people the water was getting higher and higher -- get out,'' he recounted. His mad dash was the closest many people on Sumatra would come to an early warning system. Before the waves subsided, more than 43,000 people in the Aceh region alone -- many of them women and children unable to resist the violent waters -- would perish. ''The water was coming too hard, too fast,'' Azwar Muhammad, a local resident, said. ''This was God's destiny.'' As a separate set of mammoth waves hurtled across the Indian Ocean in the opposite direction, due west, Amir Khan, a strapping 30-year-old off-duty police officer, relaxed in his home in the town of Kalmunai on the east coast of Sri Lanka. Mr. Khan, like every other local government official, was enjoying a day off and completely oblivious to the walls of water surging toward Sri Lanka when he heard what sounded like a low-flying helicopter. Some in Kalmunai remember the ocean's abruptly changing colors from green to a dark, menacing black, as if it were filled with oil. Others remember the water turning white with foam. All recall the first wave's shape: a 10- to 12-foot-tall wall of water. Mr. Khan shouted, ""Run! Run!"" to his parents and siblings and bolted out of his house, sprinting as fast as his strong, young legs would carry him. His 68-year-old father and 50-year-old mother stayed in the house. As water engulfed them, they grabbed onto a ceiling beam and were able to survive. His three sisters-in-law were less lucky. Two ran but drowned in the water. A third remained in the house and drowned as well. Three subsequent waves, each larger and more powerful than the last, obliterated the neighborhood and reached 700 yards inland. The waves ripped sturdy, one-story brick homes off their foundations, snapping four-inch-thick brick walls into small chunks. It picked up cars and swept them hundreds of yards inland. It reached the rooftops off one-story buildings, ripping off gutters as it surged passed. Kalandar Umma, a 60-year-old grandmother, was found clinging to the upper branches of a tree. She had no memory of the waves or how she got there. Nineteen members of her family died, including one son, five granddaughters and two grandsons, including an 18-month-old boy. Local officials, unsure what had happened, ordered people to go to high ground. Groups of stunned municipal employees, schoolteachers and retirees began searching for bodies. In the first day alone, 1,824 bodies were recovered and buried behind a local mosque. Local government officials quickly lost control of the process, with families burying relatives as soon as they discovered them. Advance notice of the wave's approach would have saved thousands of lives, according to officials and residents. Baheera Sahariban, a waiflike 25-year-old mother, said she had easily been able to carry her 18-month-old son to safety from her house, which sits only 15 yards from the ocean. The reason: a warning. ''Someone helped me,'' Ms. Sahariban said, as she gently cradled her son. ''Someone said, 'Run away.''' Australia: A Call to Aid At 6 p.m. Sunday in Melbourne, Colleen McGinn was having tea in her backyard patio with a man she had met recently in an emergency first aid class. It was a year to the day that Oxfam, the relief organization that Ms. McGinn worked for, had gotten the call about an earthquake in Iran that would kill 26,000. Today, it was again Boxing Day, a national holiday in Australia, and it was her turn to be on call. She knew anything could happen. She hoped nothing would. But she kept her cellphone near. Then the phone rang. ''I hate to bother you,'' the caller said. It was Marlene McIntyre, one of the bosses at Oxfam, who also happened to be her friend. ''But there has been an earthquake.'' ''Very funny, Marlene,'' Ms. McGinn said, chuckling. ''Merry Christmas to you, too.'' ''No, this is real,'' Ms. McIntyre said. ''There has been an earthquake and a tsunami. Sri Lanka was hit, we were hearing.'' It was six hours after an undersea earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra had set off one of the worst natural disasters in recent decades. Ms. McGinn, who was born in Indonesia but raised in Athens, Ohio, had worked previously in Sierra Leone, the Balkans and Afghanistan, dealing with war victims and refugees. Those were man-made disasters. This would be different. This was nature, and the marathon of tackling people's misery had just begun. ''I need a ride,'' she told her friend, instantly enlisting the young man, a potential date, into a relief aide. Off they went, on his motorcycle, along the beachside highway, driving as the sun set to the nearby home of her boss at Oxfam, Chris Stewart. The global Oxfam emergency response machine needed to be put into motion. It was up to these two women to start the engine. Now. Out came the emergency contact list, and the chain of calls began: East Asia regional manager, South Asia regional manager, the agency executive director. The list went on. But even while they were working the phones, the news coming from the television and Internet started to turn darker and darker. The would-be date turned into a decent assistant. ''We need a better map,'' she told him. ''We need another map.'' The telephone calls continued for hours, fueled by pizza and coffee that was ordered. Day had become night. But as darkness fell, what had at first appeared to be a probably deadly, but at least isolated incident -- impacting perhaps just Indonesia and Sri Lanka at first -- was turning into a incomprehensible catastrophe. ''This is unbelievable,'' Ms. McGinn said, pausing to look up at the television. ''All the countries in the Indian Ocean have been hit. This is massive. Oh my God.'' Across the world, in New York, there was a similar growing sense of dread. Jan Egeland, the United Nations' emergency relief coordinator and under secretary for humanitarian affairs, is a 46-year-old Norwegian whose boyish looks and shock of chestnut hair falling across his forehead would become familiar to millions of television viewers around the world as he reported on the global relief effort. He had been lying in bed in the midtown Manhattan apartment where he lives with his wife and two daughters when his telephone rang at 7 a.m. New York time, bringing him the first word of tsunami. Mr. Egeland and his colleagues at the United Nations offices in Geneva sent emergency relief teams to the Maldives, Sir Lanka and Indonesia, the first countries to request help, right away and began to consider additional countries as they learned more about the geographical extent of the damage. Teams would soon be added for India, Thailand and Malaysia. ''We were not even close to understanding the true enormity of it,'' he said. ''The initial indication was that a few hundred were affected.'' Ms. McGinn and Ms. Stewart would wrap up their initial round of calls sometime before midnight in Melbourne. Monday would be another day of telephone calls, as work was now under way by different Oxfam offices to prepare an IL-76 cargo plane, packed with 27 tons of emergency supplies that would soon take off for Sri Lanka and Indonesia. Water tanks, pumps and taps to set up emergency drinking water would all be included, as would latrine slabs to build emergency bathrooms. Ms. McGinn would soon be boarding a plane herself to fly to Sri Lanka, leaving Melbourne on Tuesday, for the trip across Asia to the dead zone. Her father had been in Indonesia at the moment of the earthquake, although not near the affected part of the country. Still, she had not heard from him. It was not long after she landed at the airport in Colombo, Sri Lanka, that it was clear what that phone call on a gorgeous day after Christmas had spelled: fields of misery and devastation unlike any she had ever seen. First, as she approached the seaside community of Batticaloa, it was simply the crowds of people standing outside schools and other government buildings, which had been transformed into shelters. Then it was roads clogged with emergency vehicles and trucks. And then it was a stretch of coastline where there was such utter chaos it was unclear how and where the work should begin. Boats sitting upturned on land, far from the shore. A major bridge had been lifted off its supports, twisted and then thrown like a toy. Whole swaths where houses once stood were now flat, wide-open land, the ground strewn with debris. People milled around, eyes glazed over with fear and despair. To top it all, this was the rainy season, so it was pouring. ''I never seen anything like this,'' Ms. McGinn said. The only option was to begin work, unloading trucks that had arrived with relief supplies, everything from clothes and instant noodles to soap. It was quite a distance she had traveled from that lazy evening sipping tea on the patio in Melbourne. California: A Scientist Explains As soon as Kerry Sieh, an earthquake expert at California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, heard the reports on Sunday of the earthquake and tsunamis in the Indian Ocean, he knew exactly what had happened. He was preparing for his next trip to Sumatra, the island hardest hit by the tsunami. He had spent a decade there and on nearby islands, cutting slices out of coral heads with a chainsaw to read traces of past seismic upheavals, and to look for hints about future quakes. Most of his colleagues who study undersea earthquakes were focused on even more violent fault lines closer to the developed world, those off Japan and the Pacific Northwest and the island arc of the Aleutians in the far North Pacific. Like them, Dr. Sieh was consumed with what he could learn about the dynamics of the earthquake factories called subduction zones. But the archives he mined existed only in the coral off Sumatra. ''It's tucked away in a corner of the world that just doesn't have much scientific traffic,'' he said. In the calcium carbonate coral layers, he could read the seafloor's history. Deformations of the layers showed when the seabed beneath had been shoved upward, plunged down or tilted. So the mechanism of the earthquake that had just occurred was familiar. The offshore plate of rock underlying the Indian Ocean normally slides relentlessly under Indonesia, like the disappearing belt on an airport walkway, descending into the earth's mantle to be consumed and recycled. In places, this process was smooth. The junction between that ever-shifting India plate and the plate under Southeast Asia was ''greased,'' he said. But there were places where it was stuck. In 1797, 1833, 1861 and now again long stretches that were stuck sprang free. In each case, the rock had built up tension in the intervening decades, as the greased sections continued to shift, leaving the stuck part behind, just as an archer's bow flexes when drawn. At some point, the force is too great. Friction is overcome. The stuck section gets to catch up, in seconds making up for a century of lagging behind, and if the plate is moving up or down, that energy is transferred pistonlike to the incompressible water above. The energy unleashed in a 9.0 quake, as this one would ultimately come to measure, is roughly the amount that would be unleashed if it were possible to create a bomb made of 32 billion tons of TNT and set it off. As the news media calls began flooding in, Dr. Sieh began to recount the mechanism he knew so well. It would be two days and nights before he would have time to turn on a television and witness the consequences of the upheaval. It was likely that a fresh distortion would be etched in the corals. It was certain that a region and people he had grown to love had been ripped asunder. Australia: International Inertia The possibility of tsunamis arising in the Indian Ocean had not completely escaped international attention. During the 1990's, an obscure United Nations group, the International Coordination Group for the Tsunami Warning System in the Pacific, periodically considered the extension of tsunami alert systems to parts of the globe outside the Pacific, including the Caribbean and Indian Ocean. At a meeting of the group in Lima, Peru, in September 1997, for example, its members had considered proposals to expand the network to the Indian Ocean, particularly because of Indonesia's tectonic activity. Nothing concrete happened. Among the scientists who kept up a restrained but insistent pressure was Dr. Phil Cummins, a seismologist with Australia's geosciences agency. He continued to gather and present evidence that an Indian Ocean tsunami was inevitable, although unpredictable in terms of timing, and posed a grave threat to many countries. He met with no ill will, but with considerable inertia, he said. ''Just look at the name,'' he said. ''The international body designed to coordinate international tsunami-related activity is mandated as a Pacific entity.'' Dr. Cummins cited details from dusty records kept by the Dutch colonists in Indonesia and from Dr. Sieh's coral studies that great 19th-century earthquakes in the 1,200-mile arc of faults west of Sumatra had generated destructive ocean-spanning waves. He made his case in October 2003, at a meeting of the international tsunami group in Wellington, New Zealand, when he pushed for formal expansion of the international network into the Indian Ocean. The group rebuffed him, saying, in the stiff language of meeting minutes, that any such expansion could occur only if an overarching governing body dealing in global oceanographic issues formally redefined its ''terms of reference.'' In the meantime, it voted to establish ''a sessional working group to prepare a recommendation to establish an intersessional working group that will study the establishment of a regional warning system for the Southwest Pacific and Indian Ocean.'' Dr. Cummins prepared a position paper at that meeting laying out his arguments. He used a computer model similar to that used by Dr. Titov in Seattle to study how tsunamis spread from the great Sumatran quake of 1833. He simulated the quake in a mathematical simulacrum of the ocean, and simulated waves radiated until they struck as far north as eastern India and all around western Australia. The Sumatran shore east of the fault was devastated, and a directional pulse of energy, resulting in higher waves, splayed westward like a shotgun blast. At the time, the images of those reconstructed virtual waves must have seemed like yet another computer analysis, predicting yet another potential disaster that might or might not occur in this, or the next century. Now, the reconstructions, so similar to what happened last Sunday, carry a disturbing weight. Kenya: A Last Victim Capt. Twalib Hamisi was sitting in his office at the Port Authority in Mombasa, Kenya, when word of the curious water first reached him. A staffer had phoned to report unusual movements in the main port there. ''The tide was supposed to be falling, but it was rising,'' Mr. Hamisi, the harbor master, recalled. ''I went to the water, and we saw it moving really fast. I thought a pipe might be broken in the port.'' It was about 1 p.m. Sunday, and he decided to call other ports in Malindi and Lamu, where workers reported similar water movements. ''It was like seeing the sun setting in the east,'' he said. ''The tide was crazy. The water wasn't following the rules.'' Then, Mr. Hamisi said, the minister of foreign affairs phoned to report the heavy damage in Asia. After realizing the direction the waves were headed, Mr. Hamisi called the Port Authority director. ''I said: 'We have a problem. We have to institute our emergency plan.''' The emergency plan was intended for things like oil spills or fires, not tsunamis. But it was all they had. The police were informed to evacuate beaches. The news media were called to spread the word. The local authorities were mobilized up and down the coast. Radio messages were sent to commercial fishing vessels and ships. For the wooden dhows that are so common in Kenya and that lack radio communication, the looming danger was spread by word of mouth. At Jomo Kenyatta Beach in Mombasa, there were thousands of people packed on the sand. The police made announcements at first, and then armed riot policemen moved in to relocate people away from the water. ''It was Sunday, so the beaches were full of holiday makers,'' Mr. Hamisi said. At Hemingway's Resort in Watamu, a plush seaside hotel, employees who heard of the storm on television began working the phones. They called the Port Authority, but the person who answered the phone there did not seem overly alarmed. They called the Kenyan Navy, where someone agreed to investigate. They tried to track down a British professor who someone said was an expert on the wave patterns off the Kenyan coast. Frustrated and fearful, Hemingway's staff began evacuating guests to a parking lot half a mile from the coast. Further north, Mabeya Mogaka, the district commissioner in Malindi, was spreading word of the dangerous seas as well. ''I ran out and told people not to panic but to be aware,'' he said. The beaches were virtually deserted, he said. But not everybody got the message that danger was near. There were still people swimming when the waves began to churn with more force. One of them was Samuel Njoroge, 20, a mechanic from Nairobi who was in the water with his uncle and was swimming for the first time. He was about 10 feet from the sand when the waves became rough. His relatives describe what happened next: Samuel was pulled under. His uncle grabbed him but was also pulled under. Eventually, Italian tourists who were swimming nearby got both men to shore. But Samuel had already taken in too much water. More than seven hours after the tsunami hit land in Indonesia, some 3,000 miles away, Samuel became Kenya's only confirmed storm-related death. ''We are in shock,'' said Peter Mwanji, a relative who visited the mortuary on Thursday to claim Samuel Njoroge's body. ''We are still trying to understand how this storm could have taken him. He was so excited to see the ocean and to swim in it. He was so happy. Then he was gone.'' Seattle: A Final Picture Back in Seattle, around the time that the beaches of East Africa were being swept by the great pulse of waves, Dr. Titov was close to finishing his fresh-minted model for simulating Indian Ocean tsunamis. He hit enter on his terminal keyboard, and the computer began calculating numbers. As the real tsunami was spending its last destructive power, his virtual tsunami began. It burst out like a shotgun blast from the epicenter of the quake, focused due west from the fault line. By 4:28 a.m. Sunday morning, the simulation had run its course, and Dr. Titov posted his work on the Web and stumbled home, knowing, but still not knowing since he had seen no news, what had happened. Like everyone else, he became transfixed by television images of heaving seas and devastation, with one difference, he said: ''It feels like I have already seen it.'' ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: GAUGING DISASTER Correction: January 1, 2005, Saturday Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday tracing the gradual spread of awareness of the Indian Ocean tsunami among scientists and others last week referred incorrectly to information provided in 2003 to the International Coordination Group for the Tsunami Warning System in the Pacific. At a meeting of the group in 2003, Dr. Phil Cummins, an Australian seismologist, told the group that a warning system for the Indian Ocean was needed. But it was only after that meeting, at the bidding of the group, that he began work on a position paper compiling evidence on the danger of big tsunamis caused by earthquakes near Sumatra. He is still working on the position paper, which includes computer modeling that shows devastation from waves created by a strong underwater earthquake. He did not present the paper at the meeting."
"Relief organizations from around the globe struggled Monday to deploy emergency supplies and personnel to South Asia, even as the list of communities scarred by the disaster continued to balloon. Never before, aid officials said, had they been asked to respond to a disaster that simultaneously struck such a broad swath of the world. Relief efforts are under way in at least seven countries on two continents. ''Of course, there are big disasters that affect as many, if not more, people, like devastating earthquakes in dense urban areas,'' said Simon Missiri, director of the Asia Pacific department at the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. ''But here what is really unprecedented is the enormous geographic scope.'' With communications networks destroyed in some of the worst-hit areas, work continued Monday to compile a complete list of cities and villages in Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Indonesia, the Maldives and Malaysia that might need emergency aid. Casualties were reported as far away as Somalia. Already, relief officials were predicting that the cost of recovery efforts would easily reach into the billions of dollars. ''The numbers of communities and people impacted is almost uncountable, at least at the moment,'' said Iain Simpson, a spokesman for the World Health Organization. ''This is a huge task and it is going to take time until we get a handle on it.'' Supplies and relief workers were being flown to the area from nations including Britain, France, Spain, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Denmark, Austria, Hungary, Greece, Australia, Italy and Japan. In the United States, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other State Department officials said that at least $15 million in aid would be provided, in cash or donated supplies, with $4 million going directly to the International Red Cross. ''We will do everything we can to immediately help,'' Mr. Powell said. ''This is, indeed, an international tragedy.'' The Pentagon on Monday dispatched three Navy P-3 Orion reconnaissance planes from Kadena Air Base in Japan to Thailand to assist in search-and-rescue operations. In addition, the Air Force sent as many as eight C-130 Hercules transport planes, loaded with tents, food, clothing and other supplies, from Yokota Air Base in Japan to Thailand, according to a spokesman for the United States Pacific Command in Hawaii, Lt. Col. William Bigelow. As of late Monday, one military official said the United States was considering assigning several thousand American troops to the effort. The greatest need appeared to be in Sri Lanka, where the government officially requested the assistance of the United States and other nations and organizations. In Sri Lanka alone, perhaps a million are homeless, relief officials said. Tents, blankets, water purification tablets, flour, rice, antibiotics, syringes, ready-to-eat meals and portable generators are all needed immediately, a Sri Lankan government statement said. In the weeks ahead, assistance will also be needed to rebuild housing, roads, utilities and government facilities. The United Nations is helping coordinate the response there, and called a meeting on Monday morning in the capital, Colombo, that was attended by dozens of leaders of relief agencies, officials said. The United Nations promised to immediately deliver nearly 40,000 pieces of plastic sheeting or plastic mats, as well as rope, and other relief packages consisting of cooking sets, mosquito nets and clothing, enough to assist about 2,000 families. Jeff Taft-Dick, director of the United Nations World Food Program office in Sri Lanka, said the organization could feed 500, 000 people for two weeks with food already on hand to provide aid to victims of the country's two-decade civil war. Mr. Taft-Dick said in a telephone interview that the distribution of the 4,500 tons of rice, lentils, sugar and other food should start by Tuesday. Meanwhile, officials from Unicef said a relief flight would be sent from Copenhagen to Colombo on Tuesday with 45 tons of supplies, including oral rehydration salts for children and enough medical supplies to serve 150,000 people for three months. ''Right now, it is really hard to get a clear picture of just where it needs to go,'' said Mr. Taft-Dick, who attended the meeting in Colombo. In India, the worst-hit areas appeared to be Tamil Nadu state and the Andaman and Nicobar islands. Helicopter rescue efforts were being hampered by rain, according to the United Nations. In Indonesia, which was hit by the earthquake as well as huge waves, medicine, body bags and food were sent by the plane and truck to the isolated and hard-hit Aceh region, a United Nations statement said. But the initial response by the Red Cross and other groups has been limited somewhat by restrictions on travel in the region as a result of a civil war there, one Red Cross official said. In the Maldives, half of the homes appear to have been affected. The American military command in Japan assigned three assessment teams of about a dozen specialists each to different parts of the stricken region to determine what other type of military aid -- from engineering equipment to helicopters to medical supplies -- could be provided. Perhaps the biggest task for the relief organizations will be to coordinate the response. ''Too many countries have in the past sent assistance that nobody asked for and that clogs up airports, authorities, customs facilities so that the most important water and sanitation equipment that we are desperately trying to get in would then be delayed,'' said Jan Egeland, the United Nations emergency relief coordinator. ''It's that kind of stuff that is our biggest challenge.''

"The World Health Organization, Doctors Without Borders and other international agencies have begun rushing medical teams, generators and other equipment to provide safe drinking water and sanitation and reduce threats of infectious-disease outbreaks in the Asian countries hit by the earthquake and tsunamis on Sunday. Immediate health threats include wounds from stepping on nails and broken glass; dehydration and heat stroke from exposure in hot muggy weather; the possibility of electrocution from downed wires; and diarrheal and respiratory diseases caused by various bacteria and viruses that can spread rapidly because of poor sanitation and a lack of clean water. As health workers carry out assessments to determine the immediate needs in each affected area, they also want to take steps to avoid outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever that could surge in the next few weeks as the insects breed in pools of stagnant water. W.H.O., a United Nations agency based in Geneva, recently built a new command center there that has only been mobilized a few times in response to outbreaks of infectious diseases. On Sunday, a team of 13 health experts began using the command center for the first time to deal with a natural disaster. To improve communications between field workers and the agency as they request aid, the command center has one set of telephone numbers for officials of governments and private health organizations to call. The aim is to avoid much of the competition and lack of coordination that have hampered the response of governments and private organizations to earlier catastrophes, Robert Holden, a member of the command center team, said in a telephone interview. In responding to the tsunami in South and Southeast Asia, he said: ''The biggest problem is ensuring that those who survived continue to survive and provide the materials they need. We must avoid creating a secondary disaster because we can't get the necessary materials through.'' As international organizations fly in materials to set up temporary health centers to supplement the hospitals that are likely to be inundated with people seeking treatment, logistical problems abound. Doctors Without Borders said it had to delay until Wednesday a shipment of 32 tons of relief materials to Sumatra from Ostende, Belgium, because of the lack of an available airplane. The cargo includes generators, water bladders and tanks, plastic sheeting, mosquito nets, chlorination kits, a hospital tent and various medical supplies. ''We are not thinking about food right now,'' said Jan Weuts, the group's emergency coordinator in Belgium. ''The priority is clean water.'' Desalination is considered a priority because salt water from the tsunami has contaminated supplies of fresh water. Dangers also loom from eating spoiled food. Infectious diseases like dysentery, cholera, hepatitis A and leptospirosis that are present in an area can spread through sewage, said Dr. Maria Connelly, a W.H.O. expert on emergencies. The threat depends in part on which diseases are prevalent in an area, and it can increase when sewage spills into streets. Toddlers and young children are often victims in earthquakes and tsunamis because they cannot swim and are not strong enough to crawl through the rubbish. Among surviving children, it can be a problem to enforce basic hygiene to keep them from acquiring and spreading diseases. Officials of the international groups are awaiting assessments from the first wave of health workers to reach the affected areas. ''The needs are often quite specific and have to be timely based on assessments in each area,'' said Catrin Schulte-Hillen, the program director for Doctors Without Borders in the United States. The response has to be measured to avoid sending too many teams to one country and too few to another. Immunizations are a lower priority in disasters because it takes time to organize such programs and for the body to build up immunity, said Dr. Brad Woodruff, a medical epidemiologist at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The centers have not been asked to participate in the relief efforts, a spokesman said. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: MEDICAL RESPONSE Correction: December 31, 2004, Friday An article on Tuesday about efforts to stem the spread of infectious diseases in areas hit by tsunamis misspelled the name of a World Health Organization expert on emergencies. (The error was repeated in a related article on Wednesday.) She is Dr. Maire A. Connolly, not Maria Connelly."
"No human power could have stopped the wall of water that washed over low-lying coasts from Indonesia to East Africa on Sunday. But human foresight could, and should, have mitigated the resulting tragedy. As it was, more than 25,000 people lost their lives in the flooding, and thousands more may die in the epidemics that may follow. That death toll could have been cut at least in half if the affected region had had the same kind of international warning network the United States has set up to protect the adjacent Pacific basin. Of all the world's vulnerable regions, only the Pacific has such a warning network in place. Sunday's events suggest the value of extending such a system. Within 15 minutes of the earthquake, the Pacific warning center in Honolulu issued alerts to its member countries. These included Thailand and Indonesia, which were unfortunately so close to the original epicenter that towering walls of water were already claiming their first victims. But another two hours remained before 40-foot seas crashed into Sri Lanka, and three to four hours before the huge waves reached southern India. That could have given people in danger time to escape to high ground -- if they had been told in advance and evacuation plans were in place. Such an avoidable tragedy should never be allowed to happen again. The lengthy unprotected coastline vulnerable to such cataclysms stretches from Indonesia to South Africa. It includes teeming cities like Madras and Mumbai, internationally famous beach resorts in Thailand and Sri Lanka, and India's Andaman and Nicobar islands. In a 21st-century age of global Internet, satellite and cellphone communications, there can be no excuse for failing to make sure that lifesaving information reaches everyone in the path of these killer waves. Once a strong earthquake has been detected and analyzed, the waves' trajectories can be reliably predicted, and timely and specific warnings can be transmitted to those areas lying in their expected paths. There are certain to be additional tsunamis in this region in the future, although the historical record suggests that it may be several decades before the next one strikes. That time should be used to create a reliable warning system that reaches all coastal areas. Washington, which has already offered ''all appropriate assistance'' to the affected countries, is uniquely qualified to provide the needed technical and humanitarian help. Editorial"
"In one sense, the catastrophic earthquake off the coast of Sumatra on Sunday morning was no surprise. After decades of dissecting seismic fault zones, including the long seam between tectonic plates in the bed of the Indian Ocean, scientists have gotten good at describing where large quakes are likely to occur. But the things people really want to know -- exactly when and exactly where the next ''big one'' will strike -- remain entirely unpredictable. Despite their best theories, despite more than $1 billion worth of spending on instruments on faults in California and Japan, scientists still cannot give timely warning to people in harm's way. The best that seismologists can do today is predict probabilities of earthquakes' recurring in regions where they have happened before. The predictions are typically cast in terms of 10 to 30 years. Such warnings are useful for deciding where to build dams, power stations, roads and pipelines in earthquake regions, said Dr. Lynn Sykes, a geophysicist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y. But they do not help ordinary people living in those areas. The science of earthquake prediction has a long, sorry history, including good ideas that failed, disappointing experiments and an ever-expanding list of goofy claims. In the 1970's, hopes ran high that a so-called seismic gap hypothesis would yield accurate predictions. Long fault zones were divided into smaller segments that were thought to rupture at somewhat regular intervals. By digging trenches along those segments and finding dates for past events, seismologists could infer the timing of future quakes. But segments of the San Andreas Fault in California are not so well behaved, said Dr. Kerry Sieh, a seismologist at the California Institute of Technology who pioneered the technique. Some sections erupt every 50 to 350 years. ''We don't know why,'' Dr. Sieh said. ''It may be because so many other faults interact. Or is it something fundamental about individual faults?'' Realizing he would never solve the prediction puzzle in California, Dr. Sieh turned his attention a decade ago to faults off the coast of Sumatra. His focus is on a patch of ocean floor a few hundred miles south of Sunday's earthquake. Both areas are part of a vast subduction zone, where a huge block of the earth's crust slides under the Indonesian archipelago. By dating mortality patterns in coral reefs affected by fault motions and tsunamis, Dr. Sieh determined that large earthquakes occur regionally, in pairs, every 230 years or so. In 1797 there was a magnitude 8.2 quake; in 1833 a magnitude 8.7 or bigger quake occurred. There was a cluster in the 1500's and one in the 1300's. ''We are coming up on the beginning of the next cycle,'' Dr. Sieh said. ''In the last four years, a number of smaller quakes have been flirting with these larger locked patches.'' For example, in June 2000, a quake of magnitude 7.0 was felt in Singapore. A 7.4 temblor in 2002, under Simeulue Island, off the northwestern coast of Sumatra, may have been a foreshock for Sunday's quake. A second very large earthquake in the same offshore area would not come as a surprise, Dr. Sieh said. But it could be decades away. On land, quake predictions have never proved reliable. On Feb. 4, 1975, the Chinese government said it evacuated the town of Haiching based on earthquake precursors -- changes in land elevation, groundwater level, swarms of small quakes and jittery horses, dogs and chickens. A quake of magnitude 7.3 struck two days later, and tens of thousands of lives were saved. But later investigations suggest that the claim was based on ideology, not science. The quake, it turned out, had not been predicted so clearly. Tens of thousands of people were killed or injured. A year later, a 7.6 earthquake struck Tangshan, China, without warning. An estimated 250,000 people died. In January 1994, a ''blind thrust,'' or previously unknown, fault ruptured beneath Los Angeles in a 6.7 quake that killed 61 people and did billions of dollars' worth of property damage. Exactly a year later, a similar quake, this one 6.9, killed more than 5,000 people in Kobe, Japan. An experiment along a section of the San Andreas Fault near Parkfield in central California predicted that a moderate quake would occur no later than 1993. It came a decade late, rupturing in the ''wrong'' direction, on Sept. 28, 2004. A scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, Dr. Vladimir I. Keilis-Borok, predicted a 6.4 quake in Southern California between Jan. 5 and Sept. 5 of this year. It did not happen. Such failure makes ample room for psychics and other soothsayers to explain quakes that do happen. Many signs -- odd animal behavior, strange light in the sky, tidal forces -- tend to be invoked after the fact. Many seismologists now say earthquakes can never be predicted because the earth's crust is profoundly heterogeneous. Any small quake has some probability of cascading into a large event. Whether a small one grows into a large one or dissipates depends on myriad fine details of physical conditions in fractured earth. Dr. John Rundle, a seismologist at the University of California, Davis, says the best hope for near-term prediction lies in a statistical method that identifies hot spots. Regions of concern are laid out in grids six miles on a side. Instruments pick up areas with frequent small quakes, around magnitude 3. If such activity increases, a quake is more likely within five years. This method predicted the location of 12 out of 14 moderate California quakes over the last five years, Dr. Rundle said. Still, he added, ''It only tells you where but not exactly when.'' Once the ground starts shaking, it is possible to send signals to critical facilities like pipelines and power plants to shut down operations. Such systems are in place in Japan, including sirens to warn people in coastal areas prone to tsunamis. The nations devastated by tsunamis on Sunday have no warning system, and experts said it would be some time before one could be put in place. Such systems require integrated earthquake and tide and wave gauges and computer models that can quickly project where tsunamis may travel, said Dr. George D. Curtis, a tsunami expert affiliated with the University of Hawaii at Hilo. Even more challenging, he said, is the need to create an efficient method for alerting hundreds of coastal communities, and educational efforts to be sure residents heed the alarm. That is easier to do in advanced wealthy countries like the United States and Japan than in developing countries, where the vulnerability is enormous and resources limited. ''Even if you have the technical system in place,'' Dr. Curtis said, ''you have to have people prepared to react immediately.''"
"SCIENTISTS, like art teachers who have not mastered anatomy or drawing, often assume that what they do not know is not important. And, when it comes to earth science, what they do not know is the pattern of geologic time, particularly what has happened beneath the ground in the 4.5 billion years that we assume the earth has existed. What have been the consequences of large waves and water movement to whatever life existed on its surface? Humans might know that the universe is theorized to be 15 billion years old, or that the Milky Way was formed 13 billion years ago, but the way we feel about ourselves in relation to a 4.5 billion-year-old earth is not much different from the way indigenous people studying a night sky might have felt about themselves anywhere on earth 10,000 years ago. The subject of what can possibly happen on earth is simply too big for most of us to handle if we are to continue to be an optimistic race. And so we hope for the best. Yet there are some things we should be thinking about in a more serious manner. There are facts that we should not let pass into an obscure scientific history, for remembering them will undoubtedly help ensure a safer future for all on our planet. This is harder than it sounds. We have a tsunami warning system in the Pacific Ocean because, in recent history, we've experienced tsunamis there. We don't have a similar system in the Indian Ocean. This has something to do with the technologies developing nations can afford, of course, But it also has to do with the fact that our experience with the giant waves in this region is less immediate. Yet the single worst explosion in our known geologic history -- an eruption of a 20-by-60-mile caldera some 71,000 years ago -- occurred on Sumatra, just 100 miles from the epicenter of Sunday's earthquake. The earlier eruption left a 10,000 square-mile sheet of volcanic rock, more than a thousand feet thick, and so filled the sky with ash that it probably created our last ice age. Still, the eastern Indian Ocean is thought to be an area of infrequent tsunami activity. Earthquakes as a rule occur at the ridge of land and water, where plates usually meet and either slide, thrust or pull apart, releasing awesome power. But there are exceptions. Americans believe that earthquakes are a West Coast problem. But the largest earthquake ever in the United States that we know of, probably at least as large as the one that destroyed most of San Francisco in 1906, occurred in the area of the Mississippi Valley in 1811. Boats were thrown over in the river and people drowned. Whole islands simply disappeared. This earthquake, and its aftershocks a year later, were so destructive that Congress passed the first federal relief act in 1815 to support the farmers whose previously healthy and farmable land was turned to swamp, sand and mud. The quake covered a much larger area than the San Francisco catastrophe, but fewer people were killed, for in 1811 the area was sparsely settled by fewer than 10,000, most living in log houses that would have sustained the shaking well. However, the seismological activity that caused it has never been explained in definitive terms. Scientists speculate that the earth here tried but failed to separate 600 million years ago, creating a weakness of some kind beneath the ground. The United States Geologic Survey vaguely refers to the area as a plate boundary zone, which simply means that the agency doesn't know if there are plate boundaries in the vicinity. But we do have historical evidence of many substantial earthquakes in a wide area of the southern Midwest, from St. Louis to Memphis -- an area where more than 10 million people live today. The greatest cliché in geology is the question, Can it happen again? Sure. Will it happen again? Well, nature is never overdue, and we simply don't know. The earth has had many configurations of land, water and living inhabitants over the ages, and if we think of an earth-changing event as being ''overdue,'' we are failing to understand geologic time. It is mind-boggling to think that only 200 million years ago the earth was one gigantic continent, and one can only imagine the explosions that broke it into today's continents. The plates beneath these continents continue to creep, and they don't need an earthquake to move them along. We know that Baja California is moving away from Mexico at the rate of two inches a year -- and that it has been doing so for four to six million years. We know that Europe is moving away from the United States at the rate of one inch every year, and that Maui is moving away from South America at the rate of three inches a year. Geodesy is the science of the shape of the earth and, with the advent in the last decade of global positioning systems, the geodesists in future will be able to map every movement of the land and sea with authority and exactitude. Our observation and reporting periods cover far too brief a period of time to allow us to see any pattern. What's more, there are physical realities in our world that we are not paying attention to. For instance, in 1971 an earthquake of 6.4 magnitude occurred in the San Fernando Valley in California. It occurred on a fault that had not been known to exist, and so surprised scientists, as well as the 80,000 people who lived there. At one end of this valley is the Van Norman Dam, which lost 30 feet from its top, and tons of water, during the shaking. Behind it is a reservoir larger than the one that created the famous Johnstown, Pa., flood that killed 2,200 people in 1889. Given the damage, cracks and weaknesses that resulted, engineers concluded that the dam would have collapsed altogether had the quake lasted another eight seconds. Today, almost half a million people live in the valley. Sunday's tragic earthquake occurred miles beneath the Indian Ocean, and despite its 9.0 magnitude it was hardly felt in Indonesia, and not at all in Sri Lanka. Yet the water displacement caused by the thrusting of the Indian plate beneath the Burma plate created 30-foot waves that were to kill people on the African coast more than 3,000 miles away. This distance may seem hard to believe, but after the Great Chilean Earthquake of 1960, tsunamis traveled more than 6,200 miles to Hilo, Hawaii, where they killed 61 people and destroyed many buildings with waves of more than 35 feet. Oddly, a tsunami cannot be felt as it passes ships on the open ocean, for the wave is usually small, one to two feet, and traveling very fast, as fast as airliners. It is only as it approaches shallow water that it begins to break; as the bottom of the wave slows, the top keeps traveling at the higher speed and increases in height, hitting landfall at 30 to 40 miles an hour. In 1958, an earthquake in Lituya Bay, Alaska, caused a landslide into the ocean that created a tsunami 1,720 feet high, a wave that could have swept over the Empire State Building. Fortunately it headed into a wilderness area and did not travel across the ocean to Hawaii or Japan. The possibility of great landmasses falling into the ocean is always with us, and recently scientists found vertical fault lines through a volcano on La Palma, one of the smaller and more westward Canary Islands. The volcano has a crater about five miles wide and a half-mile high, and erupts about every 200 years. The last eruption was in 1948, but the newly discovered fault lines have convinced some scientists that eventually the huge crater will break apart and slide into the ocean, bringing more than a half-trillion tons of rock with it. Since tsunamis are created in proportion to the amount of land that has fallen into the water, this event would likely create a wave mass never before known to written history, many times bigger than the wave at Lituya Bay. The wave would diminish a little as it crossed the Atlantic, but if it hit the Atlantic Seaboard it could be higher than the skyscrapers of Boston, New York, Washington and Miami. Scientists do not know if it will take one, four, or 10 eruptions to separate the landmass, only that the separation is inevitable. The only good news is that volcanoes usually send signals before they erupt, and it would take eight hours for the wave to travel from Africa to the United States' eastern shoreline. It is not sufficient time, however, to move all the people who would be in its path. In any event, surely the mountain on La Palma should be reduced in size, to lessen the impact should it ever slide into Atlantic. But, who will pay for such a huge reduction of a landmass? BIG earthquakes occur infrequently, but when they do they usually come unexpectedly and with horrendous power. It is, of course, dangerous to live in an earthquake-prone area, but what area in the world can we say is earthquake-safe? Surely the people in the Mississippi Valley feel they are safe, as do the people in New York City. Yet, New York has a fault line going across 125th Street that I would guess 99 percent of the city's population does not know about. And even if they did, they would likely be no more concerned about it than they are about La Palma. Americans have always lived in dangerous places -- on the flat cyclone fields of the Midwest, on the hurricane battered coasts of Florida, on the flood plains of the South. We live in these places because we are uncertain about the time and place of the next disaster, and we are an adventurous culture. We believe that lightning never strikes twice in the same place, despite the many times it has. I hope for the future in the same way I hope when I step on to an air-plane. I hope the people in control are of sound mind and body, and that they know what they are doing. Yet I know that simply wishing this is not enough. Terrible events in the future are in-evitable. But I also know that we will continue to be unprepared for them if we don't look more deeply into the past. By this, I don't mean a fire last year or a volcanic eruption a century ago. I mean another past, in geologic time, that we simply don't know enough about. Thinking about that ex-plosion on Sumatra 71,000 years ago is a good place to start. Op-Ed Contributor Dennis Smith, a retired New York City firefighter, is the author of the forthcoming ''San Francisco Is Burning,'' a history of the 1906 earthquake."
"The earth covered Muniamma's body even faster than the water had taken her life. The wiry gravedigger shoveled spadefuls of soft soil at blurring speed, then moved toward the next body. No time to waste, no sentiment to spare, no ceremony, no marker: just a mass grave for victims of the tsunami on Sunday, and mass grief. In the huge hole in the earth, Muniamma's husband, Mani Natrajan, a 35-year-old fisherman, bent over the mound that now represented his wife and draped a bright red cloth over it. He had found her less than an hour before, in the morgue at the government hospital, where a morbid sweetness cloyed the air and khaki-clad police officers wore white masks over their mouths. He had fallen to the blood-spotted floor, cried over her, tried to kiss her, spoken to her, in vain. Their reunion was one-sided. He had said goodbye to her and their three children Sunday morning after dropping off some fish at their thatched shanty near the shore of his village on India's southeast coast. He walked a few hundred yards to his boat at the nearby backwater. Soon after he heard shouts and saw people running, and then saw a wall of water taller than the trees wash over his home, then suck it and his family out to sea. He himself held onto a tree to avoid being swept away. ''Even one child I could not save,'' he said. It was an all-too-common lament. Here and elsewhere across the region, many of the victims were also the most vulnerable -- old men, women and children. They were among the hardest discoveries, too. Mr. Natrajan found the body of 8-year-old Vanaya at 11 a.m. Sunday, and spent the rest of Sunday and Monday looking for 28-year-old Muniamma and 10-year-old Sukaniya, and 6-year-old Surender. Relatives helped, fanning out through the flat, mucky wasteland where, until the tsunami struck, the Sonakuppan settlement had been. On Monday afternoon, he heard about a woman's unidentified body at the morgue, and came trailing relatives in his wake. Even before he reached the morgue, he seemed to have a premonition of its news: he had fallen moaning and sobbing to the ground, then was helped up and steeled for grisly duty. Now identified, Muniamma was taken out of the morgue, placed on a cot, and covered with a white cloth. A tag was tied on her foot: 196, the number of dead brought to the hospital so far, most of them women like her who had been unable to outrun the sea. At least 300 people died in this district about 109 miles south of Madras, the capital of Tamil Nadu state. An estimated 2,890 died in the state, and 1,041 are missing, officials said Monday. Muniamma's discovery made for one less missing and one more dead. Her husband kissed her feet in farewell. Then she was loaded into a truck, along with a 70-year-old civil servant, Guruchandran, who had just been identified. They were brought for burial as a light rain began to fall. They were barely in the grave before the truck drove off to fetch another load. An earthmover waited nearby. It would fill the trench only when 30 bodies had been placed inside. Nearby were broken bits of grave markers. Individual graves had been churned and moved to make room for the more than 150 bodies brought on Sunday. Muniamma's mother, Alamelu, 60, keened what sounded like a song: ''You were good in studies, you respected others. After you died you took three children with you, why are you not leaving one child here? Why are you not taking me also? Do you not love me? Is that the reason why you are going alone?'' Then she and her son-in-law walked barefoot out of the cemetery, and returned to what had been their homes. Coconut palms lay flattened. Brown water pooled in newly formed canals that reflected broken trees. Fishing nets draped with incongruous delicacy across piles of bricks. The mud yielded pots and pans and spoons, but not Mr. Natrajan's two missing children. The sea, just over a quarter of a mile away, sounded against the shore. Throughout the area, women packed scraps of belongings in bags and baskets that they balanced on their heads, and moved to high ground, looking for somewhere to sleep for the night. The homeless milled about in aimless expectation. Government officials made lists of homes lost and boats destroyed. Mr. Natrajan also prepared to leave. He would rebuild a small house, he said, and live alone. The sea took every trace of his family, even the pictures. Only his mother has some photos of his children, but she lives in Nagappattinam, an area to the south where the death toll has reached more than 1,400. He has been unable to reach her since the water came, and went. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: INDIA"
"For vivid reporting from the enormous zone of tsunami disaster, it was hard to beat the blogs. The so-called blogosphere, with its personal journals published on the Web, has become best known as a forum for bruising political discussion and media criticism. But the technology proved a ready medium for instant news of the tsunami disaster and for collaboration over ways to help. There was the simple photo of a startlingly blue boat smashed against a beachside palm in Jaffna, Sri Lanka, at www.thiswayplease.com/extra.html. ''Every house and fishing boat has been smashed, the entire length of the east coast,'' wrote Fred Robart, who posted the photo. ''People who know and respect the sea well now talk of it in shock, dismay and fear.'' At sumankumar.com, Nanda Kishore, a contributor, offered photos and commentary from Chennai, India: ''Some drenched till their hips, some till their chest, some all over and some of them were so drenched that they had already stopped breathing. Men and women, old and young, all were running for lives. It was a horrible site to see. The relief workers could not attend to all the dead and all the alive. The dead were dropped and the half alive were carried to safety.'' His postings included a photo of a body on a sidewalk with a buffalo walking by. ''It now seems prophetic,'' he wrote, ''for according to the Hindu mythology, Lord Yama (the god of death) rides on a buffalo.'' Bloggers at the scene are more deeply affected by events than the journalists who roam from one disaster to another, said Xeni Jardin, one of the four co-editors of the site BoingBoing.net, which pointed visitors to many of the disaster blogs. ''They are helping us understand the impact of this event in a way that other media just can't,'' with an intimate voice and an unvarnished perspective, with the richness of local context, Ms. Jardin said. That makes blogs compelling -- and now essential -- reading, said Dr. Siva Vaidhyanathan, an assistant professor of culture and communication at New York University and a blogger. Once he heard about the disaster, ''Right after BBC, I went to blogs,'' he said. ''This notion that we now have eyes and ears around the world is more than something we've grown accustomed to; we've grown to demand it,'' he said. Bloggers at worldchanging.com, some of them living in the affected nations, began chattering immediately after the waves hit and began discussions of ways to help. South Asian bloggers created tsunamihelp.blogspot.com to direct people to aid organizations. ''I haven't seen this level of people saying, 'You know what? We can do something here. We can connect the pieces,''' said Alex Steffen, who lives in Seattle and edits worldchanging.com. ''It's mind-blowing, and it's inspiring.'' Howard Rheingold, the author of ''Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution,'' about the use of interactive technologies like text-messaging to build ad hoc coalitions, said that using blogs to muster support for aid was a natural next step. ''If you can smartmob a political demonstration, an election or urban performance art, you can smartmob disaster relief,'' he said. One veteran of the online medium said he was initially ''a little disappointed'' in the reports he got from the blogs. Paul Saffo, director of the Institute for the Future in California, said that with the widespread use of digital cameras and high-speed digital access, he was expecting to see more raw video and analysis. He said that upon reflection he realized that it was difficult to get information out of hard-hit areas and that putting digital video online is still the domain of ''deep geeks'' with significant resources. ''This brought home to me just how far we have to go,'' he said. Ms. Jardin of BoingBoing said people online often argued about whether blogs would replace mainstream media. The question is as meaningless, she said, as asking ''will farmers' markets replace restaurants?'' ''One is a place for rich raw materials,'' she continued. ''One represents a different stage of the process.'' Blogging from the tsunami, she said, is ''more raw and immediate,'' but the postings still lack the level of trust that has been earned by more established media. ''There is no ombudsman for the blogosphere,'' she said. ''One will not replace the other, but I think the two together are good for each other.'' Dr. Vaidhyanathan said he was leaving for a long-planned trip to India today and, if possible, hoped to visit relatives in Madras. ''As long as there is electricity and Internet access, I'll blog,'' he said. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: THE INTERNET"
"The diving lesson was a 40th-birthday present from his wife, said Carl Michael Bergman, in Thailand on vacation from Stockholm, where he runs an international market research company. ''It saved my life,'' he said, tending his 1 1/2-year-old son, Hannes, in a hospital bed here. ''It may have killed my wife.'' Late Monday, he still did not know what happened to her when the waves hit their holiday resort at Khao Lak the day before. He was out at sea at the time. The diving instructors, uneasy at the strange behavior of the water around them, suspended the lesson and began heading back. They were eventually picked up by a Thai military ship and brought here. His 3-year-old son, Nils, was on higher ground with friends and was safe. Hannes, now hospitalized with pneumonia, was found alone in a hotel room by another guest. But there has been no news of Mr. Bergman's wife, Cecilia, who stayed behind with Hannes, and Mr. Bergman fears that she may be dead. ''I think he saw what happened,'' he said, nuzzling Hannes. ''He knows the answer. I don't.'' His cellphone, one of his last remaining possessions, rang, but he switched it off. Relatives ''call all the time from Sweden,'' he said. ''I can't take it anymore. What can I say? I start crying.'' ''I long for her,'' he said of his wife. There are many harrowing stories here, from people who came for a holiday that turned deadly. Thailand is still coming to grips with the scale of the disaster that engulfed its southern coast, including the major resort of Phuket, which receives about a third of the 12 million tourists a year who visit the country. By late Monday officials estimated a death toll of at least 1,000. The fatalities include Poom Jensen, 21, the Thai-American grandson of King Bhumbol Adulyadej. But Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said more than 1,000 other people remained unaccounted for, and the number of dead is expected to rise. Tourists evacuated from Phi Phi island and other locations by helicopter and boat were arriving by the thousands in Phuket on Monday, many visibly stunned, limping with cuts and bruises, some searching for missing relatives. At the city hall, where diplomats from a dozen or more countries set up desks to help their citizens replace lost documents, medical workers in a first aid room comforted shocked and grieving survivors. ''Grief counseling and bandages and hugs are what we have been doling out,'' said Debbie Cairns, 49, a nurse from Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, who has lived here for several months and is helping out. William and Amanda Robins of Sacramento, who chose to spend part of their honeymoon on Phi Phi, sensed that something was wrong when they heard screams of terror outside their hotel from tourists coming off the ferry from the Thai mainland. At first they feared a terrorist strike. They jumped a low counter and hid in a small room full of computers. ''We got down and started to pray,'' Mr. Robins said. The building started shaking, they heard a roar like a bulldozer and within seconds they were being swept away by a torrent of water of astounding force. ''We were in the water fighting for our lives,'' said Mr. Robins, 26 , a pro golfer. The water wrenched them apart, battered them with concrete blocks and other debris from the hotel and dragged them at high speed more than 150 yards out to sea. Just as Mr. Robins feared that his lungs could not hold out any longer, he said, he surfaced. Mrs. Robins bobbed up a few feet away, and a boat nearby pulled them from the water. Although Mrs. Robins suffered a fractured pelvis and her husband a broken collarbone and a nearly severed ear, they said they were grateful to be alive. ''If we can get through one of the strongest tsunamis in history, we can get through practically anything,'' Mr. Robins said from his hospital bed here. ''You think, 'Why am I broken and bruised?' then you hear about people who are missing their husbands or wives, and you think, 'Who am I to complain?''' Also counting themselves among the lucky were Chris Xaver and Scott Weatherby of Cortland, N.Y. They were eating breakfast in their hotel in Phuket with no sense of imminent danger, even as they saw a hip-high wave moving toward the shore. ''We're not idiots, but we're standing there with the camera taking pictures,'' said Ms. Xaver, 38, a communications professor at Tompkins Cortland Community College in Dryden, N.Y. Within seconds the wave smashed into the room, hurling Ms. Xaver into a wall at the back and sweeping Mr. Weatherby out the door and half a block down the road before helping hands pulled him from the current. ''There were moments I was praying my legs would snap off -- just snap, snap and go,'' said Ms. Xaver, remembering the pain as heavy teak furniture pinioned her in the back of the hotel restaurant. Now they were lying on pushed-together sofas in the lobby of a hospital here, but Ms. Xaver, who had 50 stitches in her leg and may need ankle surgery, said: ''Don't feel sorry for us. We've been hearing terrible stories. We've seen distraught family members come in screaming hotel names looking for loved ones.'' ''We are the ones who lived through this,'' she said. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: THAILAND"
"Survivors of the gigantic undersea earthquake on Sunday that swallowed coastlines from Indonesia to Africa -- which officials now describe as one of the worst natural disasters in recent history -- recovered bodies on Tuesday, hurriedly arranged for mass burials and searched for tens of thousands of the missing in countries thousands of miles apart. The toll from the disaster -- with more than 25,000 dead and many unaccounted for -- came into sharper relief on a day when it seemed increasingly clear that at least a third of the dead were children, according to estimates by aid officials. The International Red Cross and government officials here, as well as those in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, India, the Maldives and as far away as Somalia, warned that with hundreds of thousands of people stranded in the open without clean drinking water, epidemics of cholera and other waterborne diseases could take as many lives as the initial waves. Images from around the region presented a tableau of unrelenting grief. Fathers and mothers wailed over drowned children. Bodies were arrayed in long rows in hastily dug trenches. Villagers sat by ruined homes, stunned. Hotels in some of Thailand's most luxurious resorts were turned into morgues. ''This may be the worst natural disaster in recent history because it is affecting so many heavily populated coastal areas,'' said Jan Egeland, the emergency relief coordinator for the United Nations, speaking at a news conference in New York. ''Usually a natural disaster strikes one or two or three countries, not eight or nine enormous coastlines like they've done here,'' he added. ''Bigger waves have been recorded. But no wave has affected so many people.'' Nearly half the reported deaths were here in Sri Lanka, where estimates jumped Monday to more than 12,000 killed, and where more than a million people were reported to have lost their homes. The realization began to emerge Tuesday that the dead included an exceptionally high number of children who, aid officials suggested, were least able to grab onto trees or boats when the deadly waves smashed through villages and over beaches. Children make up at least half the population of Asia. On the western tip of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, the destruction was doubly fierce, caused by both the earthquake itself 150 miles away and the tsunamis that followed. The Associated Press reported from the provincial capital, Banda Aceh, that bloated bodies filled the streets and thousands of survivors huddled without shelter. The American Consulate in nearby Medan has received reports that waters around Banda Aceh reached as far as 10 miles inland. The floodwaters reportedly inundated one city hospital, drowning patients inside. Some 5,000 people are confirmed dead but that number is expected at least to double. Indonesia's vice president, Jusuf Kalla, said he attended a mass burial of 1,500. The area has been closed to journalists and aid workers because of a civil war, and only a few local journalists have gotten in. Mr. Egeland said, ''We haven't a clue'' as to the number affected in Aceh. He said it had been impossible to reach contacts there, which he called ''a bad sign.'' India reported more than 4,000 dead on the mainland. Hundreds were dead or missing in the southern resort islands of Thailand, many of them foreign vacationers. Mr. Egeland said the big problem now was to coordinate the huge international aid effort, a particularly daunting challenge given how widespread the devastation is. He said the total damage would ''probably be many billions of dollars.'' ''We cannot fathom the cost of these poor societies and the nameless fishermen and fishing villages and so on that have just been wiped out,'' he said. ''Hundreds of thousands of livelihoods have gone.'' Amateur videotape played on television showed terrifying scenes from several countries of huge walls of water crashing through palm trees and over the tops of buildings and roaring up coastal streets with cars and debris bobbing on the surface. To backdrops of screams and shouts, people were shown clinging to buildings, being swept away by the current, running for their lives, weeping, carrying the injured and cradling dead children. As the water receded, almost as quickly as it had arrived, bodies were seen in the branches of trees, and broken cars and houses littered the shores as if a tornado had struck. Some of the bodies and debris were sucked back out to sea. There were fears of thousands more deaths on India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands, where most communications have been cut off. ''In Andamans and Nicobar Islands, the death toll is over 3,000,'' said Rana Mathew, a government spokesman. ''The southern islands are the most affected. No contact with the island of Nancoveri been established as yet. So the death toll might go up. And thousands of people are missing.'' Smaller numbers of deaths were reported in Malaysia, the Maldives, Myanmar, Bangladesh and the Seychelles, as well as along the distant African coastline, particularly Somalia, where entire villages were reported to have disappeared. ''All of the fishermen who went to sea haven't come back,'' said Yusuf Ismail, a spokesman for the president. In Thailand, the government said 918 people had died, 7,396 were injured and thousands were missing, mostly on small resort islands or among boatloads of recreational divers who had headed out to sea in the morning before the wave struck. ''I would say the death toll would definitely exceed 1,000,'' Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said after visiting Phuket Island, the most prominent of Thailand's beach resorts, where the death toll stood at 130. ''We have a long way to go in collecting bodies.'' Many of those killed there were foreigners, but the most prominent of the dead was Poom Jensen, 21, the Thai-American grandson of King Bhumipol Adulyadej. The smaller island of Phi Phi Lei, which was the scene of the movie ''The Beach,'' starring Leonardo DiCaprio, was reported to have been mostly leveled. On another small island, the proprietors of the elite Phra Thong Resort said only 70 of 170 guests were accounted for. Apart from the huge death toll, it was the presence of large number of foreign tourists that distinguished this disaster from the many floods and typhoons that take a heavy toll in the region every year. In Sri Lanka, the government said as many as 200 foreign tourists had been killed. In Thailand, an official estimated that 20 to 30 percent of those killed had been foreigners. The victims were reported to include people from Germany, Japan, Italy, Sweden, France, Britain, the United States, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Holland, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, Spain and Russia. The number of Americans dead stood at eight, including a well-known fashion photographer, Fernando Bengoechea. Those numbers were tiny, though, compared with the devastation suffered by the mostly poor fishermen, farmers and laborers who populate the low-lying coasts of these South Asian and Southeast Asian nations. In Sri Lanka, Susil Premajayantha, a senior minister, said the homes of about 1.5 million people had been destroyed or damaged. Few have the resources to resume their lives without help. He said 890 miles of railway track running south from the capital, Colombo, had been washed away. Local officials told The Associated Press that some 1,500 passengers had been trapped in railroad cars as an entire train was caught in the rushing tide and swept away. At least 400 prisoners were reported to have escaped during the chaos from two jails in the southern area, and officials offered them an amnesty to turn themselves in. Across the region, police officers and soldiers patrolled in an effort to halt looting. The United States Geological Survey said the 9.0 magnitude earthquake on Sunday morning was the fourth-largest in a century and the largest in the world since 1964, when an earthquake measuring 9.2 hit Alaska. A number of strong aftershocks have followed. ''We have ordered 15,000 troops into the field to search for survivors,'' said Edy Sulistiadi, a spokesman for the Indonesian military, which is fighting separatist rebels in the area. ''They are mostly retrieving corpses.'' ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: THE OVERVIEW Correction: December 29, 2004, Wednesday Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the rising death toll from sea waves after the earthquake in Asia on Sunday misstated the known fate of an American photographer, Fernando Bengoechea, and his specialty. Known for interior design photography rather than fashion, he has been listed as missing, not dead."
"When experts at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu were first alerted that an earthquake had struck Sunday off Indonesia, they had no way of knowing that it had generated a devastating tsunami and no way to warn the people most likely to suffer. Tsunamis are rare in the Indian Ocean, which has no system for detecting them and alerting those in danger, and scientists do not have the tools to tell when an earthquake has created one. Not until the deadly wave hit Sri Lanka and the scientists in Honolulu saw news reports of the damage there did they recognize what was happening. ''Then we knew there was something moving across the Indian Ocean,'' said Dr. Charles McCreery, the center's director. ''We wanted to try to do something, but without a plan in place then, it was not an effective way to issue a warning, or to have it acted upon,'' Dr. McCreery said. ''There would have still been some time -- not a lot of time, but some time -- if there was something that could be done in Madagascar, or on the coast of Africa.'' ''One of the things that was running through my mind is just that our international group has in many past meetings had discussions about what can be done for other ocean basins,'' he said. ''And I guess I was just wishing in retrospect that more progress had been made in that area.'' The sequence of events as knowledge of the earthquake, the tsunami and the destruction unfolded suggest the speed and precision of science and modern communication, as well as their limits. If there had been a warning system for tsunamis in the Indian Ocean, thousands of people might have had a chance to flee. The first notice of the earthquake that anyone at the Pacific tsunami center received was a computer-generated page set off by seismic sensors at 2:59 p.m. on Saturday Honolulu time. The immediate message received by people like Laura S.L. Kong, a Department of Commerce expert who is the head of a United Nations tsunami education center in Hawaii, included the time of the quake, latitude, longitude and an initial estimate of magnitude, about 8.0. Nobody was in the office of the Pacific tsunami center. But staff members who received the pages reached the office, took a closer look at available data and sent out a warning to a preset list of contacts around the Pacific. The center was advising of sea level changes in Fiji, Chile and California measured in inches, the echo of a distant event that had sloshed through the straits that connect the oceans. The warning center continued to refine its estimate of the quake, eventually raising it to a magnitude of 9.0, which is 10 times more powerful than the initial estimate of 8.0, because the scale is logarithmic. The Pacific center, operated by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, faced two problems in recognizing what was occurring in the Indian Ocean and alerting potential victims. There is no direct connection between an earthquake magnitude and a resulting tsunami. Not all quakes under the ocean lift the ocean floor to displace the water needed to create a tsunami. For the Pacific, there are computer models to analyze the consequences of an earthquake, based on years of observations of previous quakes and tsunamis. For the Indian Ocean, there are no such models, according to Vasily V. Titov, a research oceanographer with the Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, based in Seattle. ''They assemble quite a bit of data to get the right information and the right warning message,'' he said of such models. Another difficulty is that countries that have experienced tsunamis in recent memory are set up with warning systems. Hawaii, for example, has warning sirens, and the ''weather radio'' network of oceanographic administration can also carry tsunami warnings. Nor is a tsunami obvious as it races across an ocean at hundreds of miles per hour. In the open ocean, the wave may be only inches high. Boats on the ocean would feel almost nothing. Only when it hits the shallow water of a continental shelf does the wave rise to its destructive height. Dr. McCreery, the Honolulu center's director, said the initial estimate of the earthquake's magnitude, 8.0, would have been likely to generate a local tsunami. ''Based on it being an 8.0, we assumed the damage would be confined to Sumatra and would be a local tsunami event, one that strikes shore within minutes of the event,'' he said. ''We weren't overly concerned at that point that it was something larger.'' But using another, sometimes more accurate method of measuring, Dr. McCreery said, the staff quickly determined that the magnitude had been closer to 8.5, more intense, but still only borderline for generating more distant damage. The center issued a follow-up bulletin. But it was not until they saw news reports of casualties in Sri Lanka that all that changed. Dr. McCreery spoke to the American ambassador to Sri Lanka, who wanted to know whether there were more giant waves expected. Then he had a conference call with a State Department official and embassy staff in Madagascar and Mauritius to address potential threats headed their way, and how the local authorities might be notified. But with no system in place, they would basically be scrambling. The Indian Ocean and some other ocean basins do not have tsunami warning systems. The Pacific basin has had a well-constructed warning system with instrumentation throughout the region and plans for communicating critical information since 1965, Dr. McCreery said. He said there have been frequent international discussions about improving systems for other oceans. ''I know for certain after this event the entire global tsunami community will be looking for ways to implement better preparedness,'' he said. One of the few places in the Indian Ocean that got the message of the quake was Diego Garcia, a speck of an island with a United States Navy base, because the Pacific warning center's contact list includes the Navy. Finding the appropriate people in Sri Lanka or India was harder. The experts knew they were set up for the wrong ocean, but over a holiday weekend, Dr. Kong said, ''it's tough to find contact information.'' ''I think they made their best efforts to contact as many people they thought they could get to,'' she said. After pushing the button to send out the initial warning to contacts in the Pacific, where about 90 percent of the tsunamis are observed, ''they're trying to think of personally who might they call, who might then know who to call.'' Last year a book on another Indonesian cataclysm, ''Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded,'' by Simon Winchester, asserted that that volcano, which set off an even more deadly tsunami when it exploded in 1883, was the world's first international disaster, because new undersea telegraph cables spread the news around the world within a few minutes. With high-speed data links and the Internet, it takes fewer minutes now, but if the information spreads wide, it does not always go deep. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: SCIENTISTS"
"Mulyana, a 24-year-old housewife, had just sat down to a wedding party on Sunday morning when the tsunami struck. She ran and held on to a coconut tree. But the water pulled her away anyway, far out to sea. ''I was alone in the middle of the ocean,'' she said on Tuesday from her hospital bed in this town on the northeastern coast of Aceh Province, the area of Indonesia hit hardest by the disaster. ''I was afraid of being pulled all the way to India.'' Mulyana, who cannot swim, clung to a coconut tree floating nearby. With the weight of her clothes pulling her down, she ripped off everything but her bra and prayed to God to help her. Four hours later a group of fishermen found her as they were pulling bodies from the water. Each morning's tide brings with it the bodies of more victims who, like Mulyana, were washed out to sea, but who were not so lucky. Others are being found caught in branches of trees where the waters hurled them. Mulyana is one of more than 200 survivors who have filled the hospitals here, many with similarly harrowing tales of how they survived a tempest that Indonesian and international relief officials fear may have killed more than 27,000 people in this country alone. ''We're seeing devastation and death beyond belief,'' Michael Elmquist, who leads the United Nations assistance office in Indonesia, said in an interview in his office in Jakarta. ''I've been through many disasters around the world, but I've never seen anything like this. There's really nothing to compare it to.'' While relief workers rushed Tuesday to get food and medical supplies to the survivors to stave off starvation and disease, Indonesian officials said 4,775 people had been confirmed dead in North Sumatra, where Aceh sits, near the epicenter of the quake. Local officials were preparing makeshift graves even as unclaimed bodies remained on streets and shorelines. The United Nations office in Jakarta received an unconfirmed report late Tuesday that as many as 40,000 people had perished in the town of Meulaboh on Sumatra's western shore. ''If that is true,'' Mr. Elmquist said, ''that's going way beyond any of our initial estimates.'' Officials fear that many people may also have drowned in a remote set of smaller Indonesian islands off Sumatra, including the island of Nias. But officials emphasized that for now it was difficult to assess the full extent of the devastation. ''Those islands are really the dark side of the moon in terms of communications, and we really have no idea what's going on there,'' Herbie Smith, who is heading the disaster response team for the American Embassy in Jakarta, said in an interview. ''The devastation may be even worse than we know, and that's the tragedy here.'' Aceh Province stands out amid the disaster's deepening toll, not only because it was closest to the earthquake's epicenter, but because the disaster has intruded on a region in the grip of a civil war. Aceh has been under martial law since May of last year, when five months of peace talks between separatist rebels and the government broke down. The president at the time, Megawati Sukarnoputri, dispatched 40,000 troops to secure the province, whose oil and gas resources are vital to government revenue. The government declared a cease-fire after the earthquake, and observers said the truce appeared to be holding, allowing relief workers to tend to survivors. In Banda Aceh, the provincial capital, reports are filtering in of thousands of bodies, some lined up outside a city mosque. Others are being carried away in army trucks. The American Consulate in Medan, more than 200 miles down the eastern coast, received reports that the waters around Banda Aceh had swirled as far as 10 miles inland. Tadepalli Murty, a professor at the University of Manitoba in Canada who has modeled the potential of tsunamis in the Indian Ocean, estimated that the waves that hit Banda Aceh could have been as tall as 15 meters, or nearly 50 feet. The waves were reported to have inundated one city hospital, drowning patients inside. Local television stations broadcast images from Banda Aceh that showed a city drenched with mud and debris, with bodies lying in the street or wedged among the flotsam and jetsam. Where the bodies have been lined up, anxious survivors peer under makeshift shrouds in search of loved ones. With phone lines down, relatives of Banda Aceh's residents are still waiting for news. At the airport in Medan, worried Acehnese crowded ticket booths, trying to catch flights to the ruined city. Employees at the national airline, Garuda Indonesia, said they were trying to obtain larger aircraft to accommodate them. Lhokseumawe, about midway between the Medan and Banda Aceh, looks like a city under siege. Soldiers with assault rifles patrol the streets on foot and in trucks and armored vehicles. Across Aceh, because of the civil unrest, army outposts dot the roads, and soldiers with automatic rifles periodically stop travelers. In one place soldiers were seen patrolling in a tank. Residents say sections of the main highway remain under the control of the rebel Free Aceh Movement. As long as the cease-fire holds, the prevalence of military units here is coincidentally helping in relief efforts. Army trucks are helping to clear thousands of bodies that have piled up on the coast, and soldiers are directing efforts to remove wreckage and search for survivors. It was soldiers, for instance, who found 45-year-old Kamaryah Hasan stuck atop a coconut tree on Sunday afternoon in Banda Aceh, her leg broken. Earlier, Ms. Kamaryah had traveled from her home in Lhokseumawe to Banda Aceh on her way to make the hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca. She was preparing to fly to Saudi Arabia later that day when the tsunami struck. ''It sounded like a jet plane,'' she said from her hospital bed here. When she found herself perched at the top of the tree, she said, she used one hand to hang on and the other to wave to rescuers. In the bed next to hers lay Khariyah Jamil, 25, who had been brought in from a village outside Lhokseumawe. Ms. Khariyah tried to run from the waves while clutching her two children, one 3 years old, the other just over 1. But the waters ripped them from her arms. Her husband has returned to their village to search for their bodies. Relief workers say the next few days will be crucial in determining whether there is a second wave of deaths among survivors who have been left stranded in the open. Many huddled under makeshift housing and rationed food and gas to brace for the days ahead. Officials worried that an outbreak of disease could spread quickly. ''The situation is really critical right now, because the distribution system here for food and medicine has just really collapsed,'' Mr. Elmquist said. ''The logistics and communications problems are just overwhelming for us, and if we don't quickly establish food and water supply systems, people will be in extreme danger.'' With three of its own workers in the region still missing, the United Nations planned Wednesday to send a relief plane with 12 tons of food and medical supplies to Sumatra. American officials were also preparing planeloads of supplies, including plastic sheeting for temporary housing, and body bags. Traditionally, Indonesia, with a proud nationalist streak, has not sought international aid for disasters and has accepted it only when offered. But this week Indonesian leaders requested aid on their own for the first time in years, Mr. Elmquist said. ''This time they're the ones requesting assistance,'' he said. ''No one's fighting it. It shows the magnitude of the devastation.'' The disaster has presented unusual problems for search-and-rescue teams and relief workers. Relief crews have had to battle on two fronts, seeking survivors from the rubble of collapsed buildings and from flooded towns and coastal areas. In the center of Lhokseumawe, the local Red Cross has erected tents to shelter roughly 2,100 refugees from coastal villages and is giving them food, clothing and medicine. They chose a site next to an Islamic center so the people could run up into the building if another tsunami came. On Monday, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono visited here and promised residents that the government would rebuild their homes. But for now few of the villagers had plans to leave the relief site. Muktarudin Daud, a fisherman from the village of Pusong Lama, had just returned with his morning's catch when the first of the two giant waves struck. When the waters rushed out after the first wave, many of the village children walked out to collect the fish left on the exposed land, only to be caught by the second, much larger wave. He escaped with his wife and three children, running for an hour ahead of the rising water, but everything they owned was washed away. ''We are traumatized,'' he said. ''We are afraid it will happen again.'' ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: INDONESIA"
"At Wat Lakken, a Buddhist temple five miles south of the resort center of Khao Lak, relief workers on Tuesday had laid out more than a hundred bodies in rows that were steadily lengthening with the constant arrival of trucks laden with more victims of tsunami on Sunday. A young man, with lacerations to his throat, arms and legs that attested to his own recent battle for survival, walked slowly down the rows on Tuesday peering intently at the grotesquely contorted bodies, a face mask across his nose and mouth to ward off the sickly stench of decay. ''I was searching for my wife,'' he said in a barely audible voice, as he completed his inspection. The man, who would identify himself only as Dominik, from southern Germany, had been together with his wife at a Khao Lak resort when the wave struck, but it tore them away from each other. Since then, he has been looking for any indication of what became of her. ''It's been three days,'' he added, numbed by fatigue and despair. ''Unbelievable,'' he said, gazing back at the bodies. ''They are lying out in the sun like zombies.'' Nowhere in Thailand is the evidence of the human cost from the disaster more visible than here at Khao Lak, an emerging resort hub 60 miles north of the more internationally renowned holiday retreat of Phuket. The waves hurled ashore mud, trees, the debris of smashed buildings, vehicles -- even a 40-foot police patrol vessel, now nestling against a line of trees a mile or more inland. And, of course, people. The Thai Interior Ministry on Tuesday estimated the number of people killed in the country at more than 1,490. Deputy Minister Sutham Sangprathu said more than 700 foreign tourists were among those confirmed dead. But he said the death toll could exceed 2,000, about half of whom had died at Khao Lak. Judging by the casualties hospitalized here, a great majority of the visitors to this stretch of coast were Europeans. The terrifying end to their Christmas holidays was attested to by the clusters of bodies wrapped or partly covered by plastic, waiting to be collected along a 20-mile stretch of coast on Tuesday. Relief teams toiled through the day along the beach fronting the Khao Lak Paradise Resort and three neighboring hotels. By midafternoon, one group said, they had taken away 50 bodies. But some 40 bodies, swollen and blackened by the sun, still lay scattered on the beach. Looking through the remains of the Paradise Resort's guest houses for personal documents to pass on to the local police and foreign consular officials, Chuleeporn Sermsirimanon, the hotel's owner, recalled how, moments before the deadly wave struck, the sea had receded. Many guests had flocked onto the beach to watch and photograph the phenomenon. The hotel received a telephone call warning of imminent danger, she said, but it came too late to alert the 54 guests, including children, who were staying at the time. Staff members ran down toward them, shouting to catch their attention, but the guests were too busy taking pictures. Nine of them are known to have died, as well as five of the hotel's Thai staff, Ms. Chuleeporn said. Farther north along the coast, similar scenes unfolded at the much bigger Sofitel Magic Lagoon, owned by the French group Accor, where 415 guests were staying when the wave struck. Company officials said only 135 had been accounted for. ''We still hold out hope for around 70 people,'' the Accor group's leader, Jean-Marc Espalioux, told France's Radio 1. ''For the rest, unfortunately, we have very little hope.'' Meanwhile, the quest to determine the fate of loved ones continued. At Takuapa Hospital to the north of Khao Lak, next to lists of victims who had been brought in, desperate survivors taped up photographs of family members, including of young children and an infant with its mother, with appeals for any information of their whereabouts. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: THAILAND"
"Rapidly climbing death estimates from the earthquake-generated waves that struck a dozen countries Sunday are likely to be highly inaccurate for some time, despite the best efforts of aid officials to nail them down, experts said yesterday. Estimates of the dead climbed to 57,000 yesterday, which would make the tsunami toll the worst in recorded history. But because so many nations were struck, with such long, populous coastlines, an accurate count of the dead is nearly impossible. Yesterday, teams began to reach remote parts of Sumatra, the Indonesian island closest to the earthquake's epicenter. Communications from some areas are still out, including on small islands that waves may have swept over. Also, experts explained, inhabitants of coastal villages and urban waterfront slums are usually subsistence fishermen and farmers who are the least likely to be counted by census takers. The only records of tourists swept away are likely to be hotel registers, which may themselves now be on the ocean bottom. Three areas hit by the tsunami are war zones with little government: the Aceh region of Indonesia, regions of Sri Lanka controlled by rebels and the coastline of Somalia. Thousands more may die if cholera, malaria or other diseases break out in areas without fresh water or sewage disposal, or in refugee camps, United Nations officials warned. No world agency is officially charged with collecting death tolls or checking them. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs issues daily situation reports, which often include estimates of the dead and displaced. ''But we don't do head counts ourselves,'' said Jamie McGoldrick, coordinator of the office's Geneva bureau. ''We rely on government sources, and we go with the figures we're given.'' News agency reports from the affected nations also relied chiefly on figures provided by government disaster centers. The best way to check those figures may be the United Nations workers in each country. United Nations doctors are on teams with local health departments and the Red Cross, and report up parallel chains of command to United Nations representatives, who work with government ministers. But aid workers are less interested in counting the dead than the living, who line up for food, water and blankets, Mr. McGoldrick pointed out. There is less urgency to account for bodies washed out to sea or buried in mass graves. Alfred Ironside, a spokesman for Unicef, said India and Sri Lanka were the most likely to be able to report accurate estimates because they have networks of thousands of local health offices reporting data to state offices and then to the Indian capital, New Delhi. It is normal for figures to fluctuate widely in the first few days after a disaster, experts said. One day after an earthquake destroyed Bam, in southern Iran, one year ago, the initial estimates of the dead were about 25,000. The estimates rose slowly as freezing weather set in, and Iran's Interior Ministry officially set its estimate at 41,000, a figure widely quoted for three months. In March, the number was revised downward to 26,271, because many people had been counted twice in the original chaos. The lowered estimate, Mr. McGoldrick said, grew out of efforts by the Red Cross and Red Crescent to figure out why so many people were in their refugee camps. In the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, up to 10,000 people were initially feared dead after planes struck the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The figure of 6,000 settled in the public consciousness until weeks of careful counting revised it downward to about 3,200. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: THE VICTIMS"
"LIKE two bookends of calamity, earthquakes at Bam in Iran and off Sumatra in Indonesia have delineated a year of unusual seismic ferocity -- a year, one might say, of living dangerously. Twelve months, almost to the very hour, before Sunday's extraordinary release of stress at the India-Burma tectonic plate boundary, a similar jolt at the boundary of the Arabian and the Eurasian Plates devastated one of the most celebrated of Persian caravan cities. The televised images of Bam's collapsed citadel and the sight of thousands of bodies being carried from the desert ruins haunted the world then just as the images of the drowned around the shores of the Bay of Bengal do today. But that has not been the half of it. True, these two disasters were, in terms of their numbers of casualties, by far the most lethal. But in the 12 months that separated them, there have been many other ruinous and seismically ominous events, occurring in places that seem at first blush to be entirely disconnected. This year just ending -- which the all-too-seismically-aware Chinese will remind us has been that of the Monkey, and so generally much prone to terrestrial mischief -- has seen killer earthquakes in Morocco in February and Japan's main island of Honshu in October. The Japan temblor left us with one widely published image -- of a bullet-train, derailed and lying on its side -- that was, in its own way, an augury of a very considerable power: no such locomotive had ever been brought low before, and the Japanese were properly vexed by its melancholy symbolism. In America, too, this year there have been some peculiar signs. Not only has Mount St. Helens been acting up in the most serious fashion since its devastating eruption of May 1980, but on one bright mid-autumn day in California this year the great San Andreas Fault, where the North American and Pacific Plates rub alongside one another, ruptured. It was on Sept. 28, early in the morning, near the town of Parkfield -- where, by chance, a deep hole was being drilled directly down into the fault by geologists to try to discern the fault's inner mysteries. The rupture produced a quake of magnitude 6.0 -- and though it did not kill anyone, it frightened millions, not least the government scientists who have the fault in their care. They had expected this particular quake to have occurred years beforehand -- and had thought a seismic event so unlikely at the time that most were at a conference in Chicago when it happened. They rushed home, fascinated to examine their instruments, but eager also to allay fears that their drilling had anything to do with the tremors. As every American schoolchild knows, the most notorious rupture of this same fault occurred nearly a century ago, at 5:12 a.m. on April 18, 1906 -- an occurrence now known around the world as the great San Francisco Earthquake. An entire city, a monument to the hopes and dreams of America's westward expansion, was destroyed by a mere 40 seconds of shaking. It was an occurrence possessed of a historical significance that may well be matched by the tragedy now unfolding on the far side of the world. But, curiously, it turns out that there were many other equally momentous seismic events taking place elsewhere in the world in 1906 as well. Ten weeks before the San Francisco quake there was one of magnitude 8.2 on the frontier between Colombia and Ecuador; then on Feb. 16 there was a violent rupture under the Caribbean island of St. Lucia;then on March 1, 200 people were killed by an earthquake on Formosa; and then, to pile Pelion upon Ossa, Mt. Vesuvius in Italy erupted, killing hundreds. But even then it wasn't over. The grand finale of the year's seismic upheaval took place in Chile in August, a quake that all but destroyed the port of Valparaiso. Twenty thousand people were killed. Small wonder that the Chinese, who invented the seismograph and who tend to take the long view of all historical happenings, note in their writings that 1906 was a highly unusual Year of the Fire Horse, when devastating consequences are wont to abound, worldwide. Given these cascades of disasters past and present, one can only wonder: might there be some kind of butterfly effect, latent and deadly, lying out in the seismic world? There is of course no hard scientific truth -- no firm certainty that a rupture on a tectonic boundary in the western Pacific (in Honshu, say) can lead directly to a break in a boundary in the eastern Pacific (in Parkfield), or another in the eastern Indian ocean (off Sumatra, say). But anecdotally, as this year has so tragically shown, there is evidence aplenty. Plate tectonics as a science is less than 40 years old. It is possible that common sense suggests what science has yet to confirm: that the movement among the world's tectonic plates may be one part of enormous dynamic system, with effects of one plate's shifting more likely than not to spread far, far away, quite possibly clear across the surface of the globe.. In recent decades, thanks largely to the controversial Gaia Theory developed by the British scientists James Lovelock, it has become ever more respectable to consider the planet as one immense and eternally interacting living system -- the living planet, floating in space, every part of its great engine affecting every other, for good or for ill. Mr. Lovelock's notion, which he named after the earth goddess of the Ancient Greeks, makes much of the delicacy of the balance that mankind's environmental carelessness increasingly threatens. But his theory also acknowledges the somber necessity of natural happenings, many of which seem in human terms so tragically unjust, as part of a vast system of checks and balances. The events that this week destroyed the shores of the Indian Ocean, and which leveled the city of Bam a year ago, were of unmitigated horror: but they may also serve some deeper planetary purpose, one quite hidden to our own beliefs. It is worth noting that scientists have discovered that the geysers in Yellowstone National Park started to erupt much more frequently in the days immediately following a huge earthquake in central Alaska in 2002. There turned out to be a connection, one hitherto quite unrealized, that intimately linked places thousands of miles apart. Geologists are now looking for other possible links -- sure in the knowledge that if real geological connections can be determined, then we may in due course be able to divine from events on one side of the planet indications that will allow us to warn people on the other -- and so perhaps allow them to prepare, as those in today's Indian Ocean communities never were able, for the next time. For one thing is certain, and comfortless: on earth, eternally restless and alive, there will, and without a scintilla of doubt, be a next time.

"The waters that stole tens of thousands of people from the shorelines of Asia and East Africa on Sunday spewed their bodies back onto beaches on Tuesday, leading officials to double the death toll again to more than 57,000. Meanwhile, scores of international rescue teams arrived hoping to stave off disease and homelessness. With tens of thousands still unaccounted for, especially in remote regions, the toll seemed certain to continue climbing. Indonesia alone already estimates 27,000 dead and Sri Lanka more than 16,000, with 4,000 people missing. Several thousand foreign tourists, many of them European, are among the missing. As local officials struggled to account for the dead and missing, another challenge began to loom: heading off disease. Rotting food and the use of outdoor toilets by the millions of people rendered homeless by the waves can all create breeding grounds for germs. The year-round tropical climes that made coastal Thailand and Sri Lanka beacons to foreign tourists are now the countries' enemies. Even as local health officials out in the field were racing to create mass graves or pyres to deal with the rising tide of bodies, saying the bodies posed immediate health risks, officials of the World Health Organization emphasized that the biggest risk of an outbreak was posed by survivors. The agency's officials said Tuesday that because there was little danger of epidemics from unburied bodies, immediate mass burials and cremations were not necessary. Instead, they said, family members and friends should be given time, where possible, to identify the bodies first. Survivors in Indonesia, India and Sri Lanka complained of the slow pace of national and international relief efforts, news agencies reported. But relief organizations said that given the scale of the devastation across a dozen countries, they were facing what amounted to the largest relief effort in history. ''The initial terror associated with the tsunamis and the earthquake itself may be dwarfed by the longer-term suffering of the affected communities,'' Dr. David Nabarro, head of crisis operations for the World Health Organization, said in Geneva, news agencies reported. Economists estimated the damage to the region in the billions of dollars. At the same time, word of the horrors continued to filter down. One heart-rending case discovered on Tuesday by reporters was that of a Sri Lankan train named Sea Queen carrying beachgoers from Colombo to Galle that was swept into a marsh by the flooding on Sunday, killing at least 800 people. The cars were toppled and the tracks uprooted. In Banda Aceh in Indonesia, two days after the waves struck, thousands of bloated bodies were still being laid out in fields, morgues and mosques for identification and hasty burial. Television showed bulldozers scooping scores of bodies into crude mass graves that were little more than muddy holes filled with pools of fetid water. Workers passed out from the stench. Aceh Province, on the northwestern tip of the island of Sumatra, was the hardest hit by both the earthquake and the resulting tsunamis. Rebels in the civil war in the region declared a cease-fire so rescue workers could gain access to those in need. Meanwhile, refugees foraged to survive, and heavy looting was reported. In the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the authorities were struggling to find housing for an estimated 100,000 people left homeless along a 130-mile stretch of coastland. Reporters described seeing doctors leave unidentified dead in the open, volunteers lift bodies with their bare hands and bodies being carted off in open carriages. In Sri Lanka, Ramesha Balasuraya, the United Nations Development Program spokeswoman, said the country was in need of virtually everything from medicine to clothing. ''It's main relief items, like water, food, clothing and drugs,'' she said. An estimated 18,000 to 20,000 foreign tourists who survived the waves have descended on Colombo, the capital, according to Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry officials. The city's hotels are packed, with some tourists sleeping in conference rooms. Others are encamped in hotel lobbies, awaiting flights out of the country. At Colombo's modern international airport Tuesday night, diplomats from various countries arrived to rescue their stranded citizens from a country that until recently was considered a nascent success story. Since a cease-fire in 2002 ended a 20-year civil war, tourism and foreign investment have soared, giving Sri Lanka a relatively stable economy and one of the fastest-growing stock markets in the world. But as the diplomats stepped off the plane, a smiling young Sri Lankan woman in a luminous green silk sari held a sign that captured the reality of the tear-shaped island nation. Instead of a sign that welcomed a tour group, the woman's sign read, ''Foreign relief teams.'' The World Health Organization said that contrary to widespread belief, there was no scientific evidence that corpses caused outbreaks if they were not buried at once. Experience has shown that the risk of such epidemics is small, two members of the organization's emergency-response team, Rob Holden and Dr. Maria Connelly, said in telephone interviews. Other experts agreed. There is ''a mind-set even among professionals in the disaster-relief community'' that bodies are a principal source of outbreaks after natural disasters, said Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. ''But the data shows that corpses are not a reason to have draconian measures that would undermine the ability of loved ones to identify bodies and go through burial rites,'' he said in an interview. W.H.O. has issued guidelines recommending against mass burials after disasters. Governments should obey religious and cultural principles and traditions where possible, the guidelines say. In most countries, domestic laws specify the requirements for proper disposal of bodies. But because the numbers of dead in the tsunamis vary widely by region, the sheer magnitude of the situation may not allow governments to follow the burial guidelines everywhere. Dr. Connelly said that ''W.H.O. is not dictating'' to governments in the affected areas. ''Obviously, there are certain situations where the guidelines cannot be followed,'' he said. ''If it takes two weeks or so to conduct individual burials, then you could potentially have a public-health disease threat.'' Disease transmission requires the presence of an infectious agent and exposure to it. So if bodies are infected with an organism, they can spread disease and start outbreaks. But most infectious agents do not survive long enough in the human body after death, Dr. Connelly said. So the most likely source of outbreaks is from survivors, he said. Health officials are concerned about cholera and other infectious agents present in the affected areas. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: DISASTER Correction: December 31, 2004, Friday An article on Tuesday about efforts to stem the spread of infectious diseases in areas hit by tsunamis misspelled the name of a World Health Organization expert on emergencies. (The error was repeated in a related article on Wednesday.) She is Dr. Maire A. Connolly, not Maria Connelly."
"If only people had been warned. An hour's notice for those living and vacationing along the coastlines of the Indian Ocean might have saved thousands of lives. But predictions, and acting on them, are not simple, geoscience experts say. ''It's an inexact science now,'' said Dr. Laura S.L. Kong, a Commerce Department seismologist and director of the International Tsunami Information Center, an office in Honolulu run under the auspices of the United Nations. According to a NASA Web site devoted to tsunamis, three of four tsunami warnings issued since 1948 have been false, and the cost of the false alarms can be high. An evacuation in Hawaii could cost as much as $68 million in lost productivity, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Since the 1960's, Dr. Kong said, there have been two warnings of tsunamis in Hawaii that ended in evacuations, and both were false alarms. Dr. Kong said the predictions of tsunamis were, in fact, accurate: the waves do arrive, whether they are 40 feet high or a mere two inches. It is the destructive power of the wave that is hard to predict. That depends on many factors, including the configuration of the ocean floor and the shape of a bay. Tsunamis, which are common in the Pacific Ocean, are rare in the Indian Ocean. And the earthquake that set the giant waves in motion on Sunday was uncommonly powerful. But an Indian Ocean tsunami was, to a certain extent, predictable -- and scientists from Geoscience Australia, that nation's agency for earth science research, issued a paper last fall describing the tsunami generated by sea-floor disturbances after the explosion of the volcano Krakatoa in 1883, with charts that showed an uncanny resemblance to the wave of destruction that accompanied this week's disaster. Australia has established a tsunami warning center of its own, which issued an earthquake alert 33 minutes after the quake occurred. Dr. Kong said her e-mail box had filled in recent days with the signs of a scramble by United Nations organizations and affected governments hoping to create a new warning system for the Indian Ocean. Such a system could be cobbled together, in part, by depending on ocean-measuring sites that are already in place, she said. The lowest-cost components are water-level gauges, which can be had for as little as $5,000 apiece but which can cost $20,000 or more if they are equipped with better instruments and quick communication abilities. A system could be put into place relatively quickly, she said, for ''millions or tens of millions'' of dollars. She said such a system would not include the gold standard for tsunami measurement, a new generation of deep-sea sensors. These devices ''wake up'' when a tsunami passes over, and transmit data to satellites, which then pass the signal along to warning centers. There are only seven of these ''tsunameters'' in use so far, and they can cost $250,000 apiece -- with annual maintenance costs of $50,000. Richard A. Posner, a federal judge and author of ''Catastrophe: Risk and Response,'' said tsunamis in the Indian Ocean had a low probability of occurring, but a high risk of damage if they do occur. A disaster may occur only every 100 years and kill 40,000 people, Judge Posner said, but ''one way to think about it is, that's an average of 400 people killed each year.'' The problem, he said, is that less developed nations ''have such urgent current problems'' that worrying about long-term problems is a low priority. Warning the public of disaster is an age-old problem with modern implications, said Kenneth Allen, the executive director of the Partnership for Public Warning, a nonprofit, public-private partnership devoted to improving crisis communications in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Education campaigns are an essential part of any warning system, Mr. Allen said. ''You need to tell people how they are going to get information in an emergency, and what to do about it,'' he said. ''If you wait until the emergency occurs, it's too late.'' Phil McFadden, the chief scientist of Geoscience Australia, said warnings without such training were useless. ''If all you do is phone up the local police station, they don't know what to do,'' he said. ''And in fact, one of the problems is that if you tell untrained people, 'Listen -- there's a tsunami coming,' half of them go down to the beach to see what a tsunami looks like.'' ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: SCIENCE"
"Rejecting a United Nations official's suggestion that it had been a ''stingy'' aid donor, the Bush administration on Tuesday announced another $20 million in relief for victims of the Asian earthquake and tsunamis and dispatched an aircraft carrier and other ships to the region for possible relief operations. The announcement brought the United States' total aid package to $35 million so far, and Bush administration officials said much more would be sent. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, displaying irritation with the suggestion of American stinginess, said the United States had been the most generous of aid donors in recent years and that, in any case, the sums announced so far were ''just a start'' of a larger sustained effort. ''We will do more,'' Mr. Powell said on ABC's ''Good Morning America,'' one of a series of television appearances apparently intended to rebut the comment on Monday by Jan Egeland, the emergency relief coordinator for the United Nations, that the West had generally been ''stingy'' in its aid to poor countries. Mr. Powell said the United States ''has given more aid in the last four years than any other nation or combination of nations in the world.'' The United States Agency for International Development spent $2.4 billion in the last year for emergency disaster relief. Mr. Egeland responded to Mr. Powell's criticism by saying that he had been misunderstood and that he had not been referring to aid for the quake and tsunami victims but to the overall trend in recent years by Western countries in aiding the poor. He said pledges for the current crisis had been ''most generous.'' ''I have been misinterpreted when I yesterday said that my belief that rich countries in general can be more generous,'' Mr. Egeland added. ''This has nothing to do with any particular country or the response to this emergency.'' Trent Duffy, a spokesman for President Bush in Crawford, Tex., where Mr. Bush is on vacation, said the president had accepted Mr. Egeland's clarification and would make a public statement on the disaster Wednesday. Mr. Duffy said Mr. Bush had sent his condolences to the victims through statements by his spokesmen, written statements and letters to seven world leaders, but not through public pronouncements on television. ''The president is doing what is needed most, which is to authorize the U.S. government to play a leading role in the relief and recovery effort,'' Mr. Duffy said. Mr. Egeland's comments are the latest in a line of long-running complaints from international aid officials about general trends in aid from Western nations. These critics often cite a figure once put forward at the United Nations that wealthy countries should try to reach a target of spending seven-tenths of 1 percent of their national economy for aid to poor countries. According to the Congressional Research Service, an independent agency, the United States is the largest aid donor in terms of dollars, but its record of donating two-tenths of 1 percent of its national economy for foreign aid makes it among the smallest donors as a proportion of what it could theoretically afford. Countering that argument, the State Department acknowledges on an official Web site that its direct economic aid is ''the smallest among government foreign assistance programs'' but that the ''true measure'' of American generosity should include private money. In an interview, Mr. Egeland said that private and government money was appreciated but that relief for disaster victims in recent years had fallen far short of what was needed and what was pledged. Victims of the earthquake in Bam, Iran, a year ago are still living in tents because permanent aid, as opposed to emergency provisions, has not materialized in the amounts pledged, aid officials said. ''Over all, there is too little money for foreign assistance, for development and for humanitarian relief, especially in Africa,'' Mr. Egeland said. ''We get one-third of what we ask for in our humanitarian appeals to poor African countries, and the number is going down. I see too many hungry children in the world, too many uncared for refugees, and too many unmet needs.'' The Pentagon sent the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln and several other ships to the Indian Ocean, though military officials said the vessels and crews had not yet been assigned specific missions. About 15,000 Americans are on board. Only a small portion of them would be expected to fly missions or go ashore. American forces are going from Japan to a Thai air base in U Tapao, on the southeastern shore of the Gulf of Thailand, near Phuket, which was especially hard hit. The military has already sent nine P-3 aircraft for use in surveillance and search and rescue operations.

(Several later articles about the disaster also misstated the first pledge.) The administration pledged $4 million on Dec. 27 for the International Red Cross and raised the figure to $15 million later that day for the total American effort. That figure was raised to $35 million on Dec. 28 and to $350 million on Dec. 31. The first pledge was neither $35 million nor $15 million."
"This island is so flat that residents say water did not just wash in from the sea during the tsunami that struck on Sunday morning, but came up through cracks in the earth opened by the quake before it. The earthquake and the waves it set off reduced the Indian naval base here to rubble, flattening homes, scattering household goods, and filling the air with the stench of death. But it is the toll beyond the base, among the 350,000 people who live on the 36 habitable islands of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, that causes most concern. The southernmost reaches of this archipelago -- 572 islands in all, spanning more than 450 miles between the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea -- are less than 100 miles from Sumatra, Indonesia, the quake's epicenter. Like Car Nicobar, most islands had little natural defense, sitting barely above sea level. The devastation here is clear, but the death toll is still uncertain. Indian officials estimate that 3,000 people are dead, and 3,000 missing, though only 500 bodies have been recovered. Some of the islands in the archipelago remain beyond communication, and are as much as three days' journey by ship. Officials fear that the disaster may have further decimated already vulnerable aboriginal tribal populations who have lived on these islands for millennia. Of the naval base's 1,700 residents, 27 bodies have been found and 76 people are unaccounted for. The rescue and relief operations being undertaken across Asia are daunting, but perhaps nowhere more than on these islands. Most have either no airstrip or very small ones. Jetties and roads have been damaged. On some islands, officials said, access is only by copter, to make food drops. The airstrip on Car Nicobar remains functional, which has meant that relief is coming via small transport planes bringing in water and food and carrying out evacuees. Night landings and takeoffs have been hurriedly arranged using flaming torches to line the runway. But for now, moving beyond the base is almost impossible because of the rubble -- mud, broken trees, broken homes -- surrounding it. Officials have been unable to reach the villages on the island's western side. Three thousand people have already been evacuated from Car Nicobar, with several thousand more waiting their turn. Residents say they believe others continue to hide in the island's overgrown interior, where they fled when the water came. Those people are at high risk for disease, with dead pigs everywhere, malaria rife and food and water severely limited. Refugees huddled at schools in the islands' capital, Port Blair, on Tuesday described how they had walked through the jungle to safety, husbanding coconut milk in the face of a brackish, fetid water supply, and sleeping on the bare ground at night. ''We don't know how we walked, how we came there,'' said Cicily Robert, 30, a teacher, describing her march, along with pregnant women and children, to the safety of the district headquarters. All of the 15 villages around this small island sit close to the sea. ''Nothing is standing in my village except coconut trees,'' said Suraj Mandal, 21, a vegetable seller from the village of Malacca. The Andaman and Nicobar islands are home to six aboriginal tribal groups, some of whose numbers have dwindled to a few hundred or less. Their fates are unknown. Where all of them, tribal and nontribal alike, will live until their villages are rebuilt is unresolved. At the airport in Port Blair -- their home for now -- a group of teachers and their families from the central government school at the base on Car Nicobar compiled a tally of the missing, and a list of everything they had lost: homes, educational certificates, scooters, jewelry, dignity. Late Tuesday afternoon, Wing Commander Sumit Mukherjee made his third sortie of the day, carrying 90 men, women and children, and one body from Car Nicobar to Port Blair. ''If you are alive, you are alive,'' he said. ''That's life.'' ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: ISLAND CHAINS"
"The tsunami that struck over the weekend spread a ring of destruction through nearly a dozen countries. Those are the places most directly affected, and on a calamitous scale. But the disaster has rippled far beyond South Asia, making it truly a tragedy felt across the globe. Among the tens of thousands of people missing or dead, thousands are believed to have come from outside the region, including many who were spending their holidays at Thai, Malaysian and Indonesian beach resorts. Reported deaths now cover at least 40 nationalities, reaching from South Africa to South Korea, with surprising concentrations of people still unaccounted for from European countries. Those still missing include 1,500 from Sweden and 700 to 800 from Norway, 300 from New Zealand, more than 200 each from Denmark and the Czech Republic, 100 from Germany, 100 from Italy and 188 Israelis. The disaster's reach is an unsettling reminder that globalization has brought the world closer together in unexpected ways so that people now share the pain as well as profit from far-flung places. Even for people who have never left home, otherwise abstract calamities in distant lands now frequently have a familiar face. Only a hundred Europeans have been confirmed dead so far, leaving anxious relatives and friends to await word from distant lands where often-sketchy communications were either overloaded or knocked out altogether after the devastation struck. There is little way to know for now whether many of those missing have been killed or are merely cut off. Meanwhile, stories of desperate searches and unlikely reunions have begun to trickle in from abroad. Vacationing children who lost their families in the disaster are slowly being identified. A Swedish boy, 7, was found at a shelter in a Buddhist temple in Phuket, Thailand, on Monday. Marie Gulbstrand, a doctor from Stockholm, told The Associated Press that the boy has identified himself as Karl Nilsson and that his parents and two brothers were swept from their hotel by the surging water. A 10-year-old German girl pictured on the Phuket hospital Web site has given her name as Sophia Michl and says her parents are Norbert and Edeltraud Michl. Both are missing. Olinto Barletta, an Italian tour operator, made the rounds of Phuket hospitals on Tuesday waving an Italian flag to track down compatriots who had survived the wave, according to the Italian news agency ANSA. He told the news agency that he had found about 50 Italians alive but that many of them had missing friends or relatives. A dozen Italians have been reported dead, mostly in Thailand. But more than 2,000 Italians were vacationing in Sri Lanka, about 1,500 on the Maldive Islands and another 1,000 in Thailand and in Indonesia when the waves struck, according to an Italian tourism association. The situation was worse for Sweden and Norway. ''It could be the most serious catastrophe of modern times to hit Norwegians abroad,'' Norway's foreign minister, Jan Petersen, told the country's public television station, NRK. Johan Murray, a spokesman for the Swedish Foreign Ministry, said 20,000 to 30,000 Swedish tourists were vacationing at Thai beach resorts when the disaster struck. ''Thailand is one of the most popular places for Swedes to go during Christmas and New Year's,'' he said. ''Only six Swedes have been confirmed dead, but we think many, many more people have died.'' Winter-fleeing visitors from across Europe and northern Asia book rooms in the region's beachside hotels for the high season in December and January. Many of the best resorts operate at total occupancy during the year-end holidays. Premiums paid for proximity to the sea meant that some of the region's wealthiest tourists were the most vulnerable. At the Sofitel Magic Lagoon resort in Khao Lak, one of the worst-hit areas on the Andaman Sea coast, the three-story bungalows closest to the water were entirely gutted. The resort's French operator, Accor, said Tuesday that 35 bodies had been recovered from the ruins and that more than 200 of the hotel's 415 guests were still missing. A hotel spokesman said that the hotel did not know the nationalities of the dead or missing, but that more than two thirds of the guests were German. The Thai deputy interior minister, Sutham Sangprathum, said Tuesday that more than 700 foreign tourists had been identified among the dead in southern Thailand. The French Foreign Ministry confirmed the deaths of 10 citizens and reported 18 missing and presumed dead because they were seen being swept away. Britain listed 18 deaths, Turkey 26 and the United States 11. The dead included relatives of the well known and the unknown. The British actor Richard Attenborough lost two members of his immediate family in Thailand, including a 14-year-old granddaughter, who was found dead, and her mother, Mr. Attenborough's daughter, who is missing. The mother-in-law of Mr. Attenborough's daughter is also missing, according to a statement released by a family friend. The former German chancellor Helmut Kohl was evacuated Tuesday by helicopter from a hotel in Sri Lanka. The fashion photographer Simon Atlee was swept away in the Thai resort of Phuket while his companion, Petra Nemcova, a Czech model who appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue last year, survived after clinging to a tree. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: REACTION"
"His home gone, his family shivering and hungry, everything he owned swept out to sea, Velu Kannan wandered down a lonely road on Wednesday looking for a pen. Stagnant salt water lay in the fields around him, reflecting a gray sky. In his hands he carried a piece of cardboard he had found among the debris. ''I need somebody to help me write 'Refugee Camp,''' he said. ''All the cars drive past us. Nobody knows we are here.'' Mr. Kannan and his family fled their fishing village when it was destroyed on Sunday and took refuge with 10 other families on a hillside where they hoped to be safe if giant waves crashed in again from the sea. Now he needed to survive. All along the shoreline here in Trincomalee district on the hard-hit eastern coast of Sri Lanka, small groups have found shelter in schools, temples, vacant buildings or makeshift tents, kept alive by small donations from private convoys of trucks and vans. ''What we need is clothes,'' said Wasantakumari Sridhar, 35, who was camped by the side of the road under a tarpaulin with two other women, three men and nine children. ''Our homes have become mud. Everything we had is gone.'' Not far down the road, in the shelter of a half-built gasoline station, Pasida Muhamad said: ''We only want food and milk. We are not asking for everything. But our babies have no milk to drink.'' The death toll in Sri Lanka continued to climb Wednesday past 22,000 as more bodies were pulled from debris or floated ashore with the tides, to be quickly buried. At the same time, a new potential disaster approached as up to two million people remained homeless without adequate food, water, sanitation and medical care. Some, like the families along the road here in Nilaveli, were receiving small handouts. Others, like the villagers north of the broken bridge at Kuchchaveli or farther south on the sand bars near Batticaloa, remained beyond the reach of aid. ''It's a mess,'' said Patrick Walder, who heads the office of the International Committee of the Red Cross here in Trincomalee. ''The problem is disorganization. There are many agencies and they are not coordinated. The government is not coordinating. Some of the district offices are wiped out so we have nothing to work with.'' Private banks are running out of money, he said. Fuel and medicine are running short. There is an immediate need for the basics of food and shelter. If disease begins to spread, as many people fear, medical care will become urgent. In the initial division of labor, he said, the government is responsible for food distribution; standard emergency stockpiles will soon run out. The government has also begun chlorinating contaminated wells. Large areas must have electric power restored. Scores of bridges need to be rebuilt. Red Cross agencies will provide survival kits that include sleeping mats, plastic sheeting, plates, cups, buckets, cooking pans, soap, washing powder and sheets. The first trucks of supplies began heading here from the capital, Colombo, on Wednesday. ''The question is, are there enough supplies to meet the demand?'' said John Punter, another official with the International Committee for the Red Cross. ''Are there a million plastic buckets in Sri Lanka?'' Soon, planeloads of aid will start arriving in Colombo from abroad, he said. ''The first thing is, where do you start? It's everywhere. It's the whole country. And not only is it one country, it's six or seven countries over a massive area.'' Sri Lanka's challenges -- from survival to subsistence to the avoidance of epidemics-- are only the beginning. In this poor country of 20 million people, as many as a million or more now have no way to earn a living. ''What we need is boats,'' said the men sheltering on the hillside with Mr. Kannan. Like most of these coastal refugees, they were fishermen and like most of them, their boats, nets and motors were swallowed by the ocean that once fed them. Once the world has spent millions of dollars on aid to the victims here and around the region, it is hard to know how these penniless fishermen will find the means to support their families again. In Trincomalee, which was sheltered in a cove from the worst of the inundation, scores of fishermen have pulled their boats out of the harbor for safety and they now line the narrow streets like parked cars. As a measure of the national trauma here, the disaster caused by an undersea earthquake measuring a 9.0 magnitude is now being referred to on television as ''9.0, 2004.'' Radio stations have begun reading out the names of the missing, just as desperate families in America posted photographs of the missing after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Some people are raising the hope of a silver lining -- that this calamity will help bring together the Tamil and Sinhalese sides that fought nearly 20 years of civil war until a fragile cease-fire was declared in 2002. Mr. Walder of the Red Cross said the Tamil rebels have been ''quite well organized'' in bringing relief to areas they control. The aid group associated with them, the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization, has been cooperating well with the government, he said. In Trincomalee, Sunday's natural disaster struck an area that had been torn apart by fighting for years. Along the Nilaveli road, buildings knocked askew by the ocean stand side by side with the rubble of buildings destroyed by war. The turbulent waves robbed a nearby military base of its weapons just as Tamil raiders had done in the past and scattered buried land mines back into areas that had been cleared since the cease-fire. On the grounds of the ruined Nilaveli Hotel, cars hung from trees along with bits of clothing, a dead goat and a head of cabbage. Foam hissed up the quiet beach and the ocean stretched to the horizon, placid and glittering, almost smug after this demonstration of its power. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: THE VICTIMS"
"Millions of dollars are flowing into the coffers of major disaster relief organizations to help victims of the tsunami that ravaged countries on the Indian Ocean. A man walked into the Atlanta office of CARE USA, a branch of the international aid organization, and handed the receptionist a check for $10,000. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has allotted $3 million for food, water, shelter and health care, and organizations report that their Web sites are overwhelmed by people seeking to donate electronically. The money could not come at a better time, aid officials say. Many of the organizations that traditionally swing into action to address emergencies are already working in other parts of the world, like Afghanistan, Iraq and Sudan, that are afflicted by crises, and they are stretched thin. ''Just having those three crises happening simultaneously and having them be equally contentious was unique, and now this has upped the ante,'' said Susan Laarman, a spokeswoman for Mercy Corps. ''We're up to the task, but it is certainly an unusual time in history.'' While the challenges of this disaster are typical of any emergency, in this case they are multiplied over several countries and regions, many of which were destitute. ''When you have a catastrophe like this in places that are already suffering from poverty, they are disproportionately worse off,'' said Ahuma Adodoadji, director of emergency and humanitarian assistance at CARE USA. The first shipments of international aid have started arriving across the region, officials said. An eight-member team from Doctors Without Borders landed in Aceh Province in Indonesia on Wednesday and set up a tent to provide primary health care services, supported by two planeloads of supplies, including water and sanitation support and installation systems. ''Things are really drastic there,'' said Catrine Schulte-Hillen, program director of the organization's United States operations. ''There are no buildings standing.'' Conditions imposed by the disaster will limit the group's response initially. For instance, the team would like to use a helicopter to try to get a better read on the extent of the devastation in areas outside of Banda Aceh, but obtaining gasoline is virtually impossible, Ms. Schulte-Hillen said. Save the Children was one of the only organizations to have a staff in Indonesia's Aceh region when the tsunami hit, a situation that has been both a blessing and a curse. The organization's finance assistant, Suka Mardiah, and her baby were killed, two staff members are missing and two others are missing family members. Jailani, the organization's driver, was swept out to sea and presumed dead until he walked into the office this morning, after swimming back to shore. '' At the same time we're sending in large quantities of baby foods and medical supplies for general relief efforts, we're also sending in food packages for our staff who have lost everything they owned,'' said Rudy von Bernuth, vice president for humanitarian programs at Save the Children USA. Mercy Corps said some of the plastic sheeting it intended for use as temporary shelter in Aceh would have to be used for makeshift body bags. The emergency stage of the crisis there is expected to last a year. The airport there can accommodate mid-size planes, Mr. von Bernuth said, but it is backed up because of the demand from relief organizations trying to get supplies and medicine into the area, as is another, larger airport. Customs clearance is still iffy, and transportation and accommodation for arriving relief workers is hard to come by. Communications are almost nonexistent. In Sri Lanka, Mercy Corps estimates that one million or more people are homeless, and delivery is complicated because most supplies will have to be delivered through Colombo, which had the country's only significant airport. The wave uprooted mines that were buried during Sri Lanka's civil war, and aid officials are scurrying to alert people to stay away from them. The United Nations World Food Program had stock there, and more was coming in on trucks, Mr. von Bernuth said, and some wells have been dug and temporary shelters erected. Coordinating groups have been set up in Sri Lanka and India to ensure that organizations and government agencies do not duplicate efforts and that the work they are doing addresses the existing needs. The large relief agencies are accustomed to working together, and in some cases the United Nations is designated as the coordinator, Mr. Adodoadji said. Relief agencies have asked the public to contribute money because shipping goods from the United States to the disaster areas is complicated and expensive. Ms. Laarman of Mercy Corps said the organization was stunned to have raised $1.5 million in less than four days, outpacing the previous record of $600,000 over the same time period for Kosovo. Yesterday the organization collected more over the Internet than it ever has, $556,000 compared with $96,000 a year ago for the earthquake that struck Bam, Iran. Organizations are concerned, however, that the huge groundswell of philanthropy directed to this crisis will divert assistance from other sites of catastrophe. ''Darfur is still a huge challenge, an emergency situation with serious security concerns,'' Ms. Schulte-Hillen said. ''In the Republic of Congo, we're seeing massive displacement with new outbreaks of war. The support for this new crisis is great, but I hope we will not forget other ongoing emergencies.''

"A tsunami warning system that could have saved thousands of lives this week should be in place in South Asia and Southeast Asia within a year, the United Nations said Wednesday. The technology to detect earthquakes under the sea and predict their consequences already exists in the Pacific and must now be extended to the Indian Ocean, said Sálvano Briceño, director of the United Nations disaster reduction office based in Geneva. Mr. Briceño noted that the tsunami took an hour to reach the coast of Indonesia and two Indian islands, another hour to hit Thailand and Sri Lanka and a full six hours to reach Africa. That provided ample time for many of the victims to have been warned of its approach and to have taken action to get to higher ground and save themselves. ''I want to see that every coastal country around South Asia and Southeast Asia has at least a basic but effective tsunami warning system in place by this time next year,'' Mr. Briceño told a news conference in Geneva. ''It's not a matter of setting up a new system or creating a new system, but more making available and connecting the authorities in Indian Ocean countries to those systems that exist,'' he said. What was needed, he said, was a network linking governments with earthquake warning centers in the United States and Japan and ways for those governments to speed word to their coastal communities. ''What is needed is to develop a culture of prevention to allow people to identify risk and to reduce vulnerability,'' he said. Arguing that this week's disaster had raised global awareness of the vulnerabilities of many nations to tsunamis, he said he had heard from Caribbean countries and European and North African countries along the Mediterranean asking for guidance on how to protect themselves. He said he had also been in touch with other United Nations agencies, with technical institutes and Indian Ocean governments and had discovered that in addition to a strong basis of knowledge, technology and willingness to collaborate there was ''a real readiness to act.'' ''There is no reason why this cannot be done,'' he said. He said the subject would now become a principal concern at a United Nations conference on disaster reduction scheduled for Jan. 18-22 in Kobe, Japan. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: TECHNOLOGY"
"In normal times, there might be no evident link between a wooden cabin in the snowbound forests of Sweden and the sunstruck beaches of Southeast Asia. But these are not normal times, and now there is a strand of pain that binds the pine-clad home of Solveig Uhlander to a beach in Thailand where her son, grandson and daughter-in-law have simply disappeared. ''I have a little hope. Only a little. But I must have hope,'' Mrs. Uhlander said on Wednesday, as if hope were all that survived the six days since she heard her 2-year-old grandson wish her Merry Christmas by cellphone, the five days since a photo of him on the beach arrived with a cellphone text message, and the four days since the tsunami waves pounded the resort of Khao Lak and the messages stopped coming. Her loss is by no means unique here. Of all the European nations counting their dead in the disaster, Sweden may have suffered the most. Of an estimated 20,000 Swedes who voyaged to Thailand for year-end vacations, around 1,500 are unaccounted for, according to Foreign Minister Laila Freivalds, compared with about 900 from Norway, 1,000 from Germany and 1,200 from Switzerland. ''The catastrophe is probably the worst of our time and will impact everyday Swedish life for a long time to come,'' Prime Minister Goran Persson said at a news conference Wednesday. And so, the disaster in Asia and East Africa is played and replayed through a particular prism across Europe, a far-flung tragedy that has invaded European homes, not just on television but in phone calls that do not arrive, relief that never comes. ''Slowly it is coming to us that we have been hit by a tremendous catastrophe,'' said Lars Collmar, a Lutheran priest who addressed 100 worshippers from a high, gilded pulpit at Stockholm's Adolf Fredriks Church on Wednesday night. ''We live in a world which is at the same time paradise and hell.'' That is precisely the imagery that has haunted Swedes, like thousands of other Europeans, contemplating the televised images of palms and beaches that contrast so cruelly with their loss. Sensing that their personal tragedies were only a small part of the cataclysm, many Europeans rushed to contribute money to international relief efforts. Others, like Mrs. Uhlander, nursed their grief in homes lighted by seasonal candles that had suddenly come to resemble those of a shrine. Outside the door to her home, in the suburb of Haninge, 10 miles south of central Stockholm, the snow froze on the steps where it would normally have been swept. It seemed, she said, as if the natural order had been reversed. ''I cannot tell you with words,'' Mrs. Uhlander said as her daughter, Maja Persson, held her hand and her husband, Goran, brewed coffee. ''Your child should not go before you. This is my first child, my first and only grandchild.'' Others shared her grief. Newspapers, like the afternoon tabloid Aftonbladet, published scores of photographs on their print and Internet editions, showing the faces of the missing young children, couples and entire families, many of which are now sundered. The faces peering from the newspaper reminded some of photos of the missing and dead in New York after Sept. 11, 2001. At Stockholm's Arlanda airport, hundreds more returned home on special flights. ''They need to come home,'' said Nisse Renman, the airport chaplain. Each land, of course, has its benchmarks of suffering. For Sweden, the most recent was the 1994 sinking of the Baltic ferry Estonia, when 852 people died, 551 of them Swedes. But people here seemed to feel that this newest loss was greater. ''It's growing bigger and bigger for everybody,'' said Titti Hogstrom, a social worker who arrived to pray at the Adolf Fredriks Church. And each land has its way of dealing with pain. Here, usually undemonstrative people seemed locked in their own privacy, desperate for release. ''We are walking around in this nightmare and hoping that we will wake up and it will all have been a dream,'' said Ms. Persson, 32. So many times in the past few days, she said, the family has gone over the events since Mrs. Uhlander's son, Mats, 36, his wife of six months, Maria, also 36, and their son, Noah, set off for Thailand. ''We are trying to do things,'' Ms. Persson said. ''I have put up photos and information on the Internet sites, in the newspapers, in the Phuket Gazette'' in Thailand. ''We are grasping at straws.'' Sometimes they watch the news. Sometimes the sight of the beach where their family was last seen is too painful. Sometimes it is not. ''If the terrible thing has happened to my son and his family, I'm glad to have seen the place they went to,'' said Mrs. Uhlander, 55, a driving instructor. ''But I'm never going to that place in my life.'' Her husband broke in: ''We were planning to go down there in February. But not now.'' What was most troubling, Mrs. Uhlander said after a while, was the fact that there seemed to be no trace of her family, still less the chance of recovering the bodies. ''I want to have a grave to go to, to talk, to take flowers to and pray,'' she said. ''If they can't find any bodies that will be the worst thing for me.'' Her husband said, ''I'm afraid there are many sharks in the sea.'' Sometimes, it seemed difficult to distinguish who was comforting whom the most as Mrs. Uhlander and her daughter sat on the sofa, their hands entwined. Finally, Mrs. Uhlander gave voice to the question that gnawed at her. Her family, she said, had planned to meet friends in Thailand and to change hotels. ''Why weren't they in a hotel on the other side? Why were they just there,'' she asked. ''That's the question I always come back to. They were going to meet their friends. So why wasn't it the other family that was there and my family was going to meet them? Why isn't it different?'' ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: SWEDEN"
"Tens of thousands of tsunami survivors are at risk from diseases spread by dirty water, mosquitoes and crowding, and the best medicine is large quantities of clean water, officials of the World Health Organization said yesterday. While no epidemics have been confirmed in the vast coastal areas devastated by the tsunamis on Sunday, the officials said they were most worried about diarrheal diseases -- cholera, typhoid fever and shigellosis -- as well as liver diseases like hepatitis A and E. Those diseases are caused by bacteria or viruses in contaminated drinking water or food, in sewage and among people who lack clean water to wash their hands. Health organizations like the W.H.O. and Unicef recommend that each person be given about five gallons of clean water a day. Dr. David Nabarro, the director of crisis operations for the W.H.O., said in a telephone interview from its headquarters in Geneva that water shortages had already occurred in the Maldives and Sri Lanka, and that tanker trucks would be needed to provide clean water. In addition, water-purifying tablets are being rushed into the affected countries, along with medicines to treat the dehydration that can result from diarrhea. Another hazard to drinking water is contamination of wells by salt water from the tsunamis. Martin Dawes, a regional spokesman for Unicef in Colombo, Sri Lanka, estimated that 1,000 drinking-water wells in the country's hard-hit eastern region had been contaminated and would have to be pumped out. ''At the moment,'' he said, ''the water people don't have the right kind of pumps to rescue the wells.'' He added that his agency was seeking pumps or money to buy them. Mr. Dawes said Unicef had also bought about 20 million gallons of drinking water in 1,500-gallon barrels, enough for 100,000 people, and was expecting them to be delivered to the affected areas on Thursday. Dr. Nabarro also said there had been unconfirmed reports of measles in Sri Lanka. ''That does give me cause for concern, because we would have expected a pretty high level of coverage by immunization in Sri Lanka,'' he said. The disease is caused by a virus that spreads through the air when patients cough, particularly in overcrowded conditions like shelters set up for people whose homes were destroyed. Although influenza can also spread rapidly in such conditions, the areas hit by the tsunamis have not reported flu outbreaks, and are unlikely to experience them, officials said. Among the diarrheal diseases, cholera, typhoid and shigellosis are caused by bacteria. In cholera, the bacterium produces a toxin that causes severe fluid loss and can kill quickly, and the key to treating it is to replace fluids. Typhoid can also be fatal and requires antibiotic treatment. Shigellosis causes severe dysentery but usually goes away in about a week. Dr. Nabarro said relief workers would provide antibiotics to treat these infections, but he said the health organization recommended against using the drugs prophylactically, to prevent illness. Widespread use of the drugs in healthy people would contribute to the emergence of bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Hepatitis A and E, caused by viruses, infect the liver and can cause jaundice, fever and abdominal discomfort. Hepatitis A usually causes a mild illness, but can become disabling. Hepatitis E can be fatal in pregnant women. Dr. Pino Annunziata, a member of the W.H.O. emergency team, said that within a few weeks, there could also be increases in mosquito-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, unless insecticide-spraying starts immediately. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: HEALTH"
"Bodies still lay strewn among the debris in this provincial capital on Wednesday, telltales of the havoc wrought by the earthquake and tsunami that struck on Sunday and of the threat of death from disease that stalks those stranded in the ruins. The hardship from what some people are calling ''black Sunday'' is taking an increasing toll here in Indonesia's hardest-hit province, Aceh, home to virtually all of the more than 45,000 people counted dead in the nation so far. Rescue teams began arriving here on Wednesday to assist in picking through the rubble and to bring food, water and temporary shelter for the dispossessed. But already some residents in this city of 300,000 people say they have grown frustrated by the slow pace of the relief effort, which was only slipping into gear in this remote northwest corner of Sumatra three days after the catastrophe hit. Thousands of people remain missing, including most of the staff of a local newspaper that last published on Saturday, the day before the earthquake. Occasional looting has broken out amid power shortages and boarded-up shops. The escape of several hundred inmates from a local prison during the tsunami has added to concerns about crime and insecurity. Food is being carefully rationed, with some local shops charging double or triple the going rate for eggs, rice and other staples. Potable water is in short supply, as is fuel for cooking food or even boiling water for rice. The dire situation has left some residents to fend for themselves, with the aid of friends and relatives outside the region. While hope is fading that any more survivors will be found in the wreckage, rescuers are now racing to recover and identify bodies and prevent the spread of disease. Concerns are already rising that a shortage of clean drinking water and medicine may bring a new wave of fatalities. ''We are afraid that there could be an outbreak of gastroenteric diseases because of poor sanitation and the environment,'' said Mariani Reksoprodjo, a spokeswoman for the Health Ministry. As hard as this city has been hit, attention is shifting to the broad flat region around the city of Meulaboh, about 100 miles southeast of here, where officials estimate that as many as 40,000 of the district's 174,700 people may have been killed. The government's official death toll on Wednesday stood at 45,268, with all but 239 of those deaths in this devastated province. Another 1,240 people were listed as missing. But those numbers did not count the vast majority of those feared dead in Aceh Barat, the district where Meulaboh is located. The tsunami appears to have washed out all roads leading to that city of 53,000, leaving it accessible only by air. On Wednesday, after touring the area around Meulaboh in a helicopter that included an Associated Press Television News crew, the military commander in Aceh, Maj. Gen. Endang Suwarya, told the news service that three-quarters of the western coast had been destroyed. The authorities expected to find at least 10,000 dead in the area, which would raise the country's death toll above 45,000, The A.P. reported. Video broadcast on local television showed a vast sea of splintered debris interspersed by only a few standing buildings. The A.P. said whole villages had been ripped apart, covered in mud and seawater. When the helicopter touched down in Meulaboh, townspeople ran down from the high ground where they had taken refuge. For some it was the first contact they had had with the outside world in days. Some cried and others whooped for joy, The A.P. reported. ''The water in the sea pulled back, then 50 minutes after that, the huge wave came back to us and destroyed everything,'' The A.P. quoted one resident as saying, without giving his name. Elsewhere along the coast, most of the area's simple wooden homes appeared to have been flattened, and those that still stood had their tin roofs torn off, the news service said. A solitary mosque and green treetops were all that broke the water in one town. The only signs of life were a handful of desperate people scavenging a beach for food. ''We prayed and prayed that someone would reach us,'' said Sukardi Kasdi, a villager in Calang, where people picked through debris amid overturned cars, The A.P. reported. Efforts to send rescuers to Aceh have been complicated by the region's remoteness. But they also were not helped by that fact that the province had been sealed to all but members of the military, a policy that the government slowly reversed after the disaster. Aceh is home to a violent separatist movement and since the middle of last year has been under the control of the military, with 40,000 soldiers in the province. Indonesia's government has sent nearly 300 health workers, including paramedics and surgeons, into Aceh with body bags, mosquito nets and field hospitals. International relief is also finally starting to arrive. Three Australian Air Force C-130 cargo planes sat on Wednesday on the tarmac at Medan, on the eastern coast, preparing to take aid into Aceh. The United Arab Emirates has also sent 32 rescue personnel with dogs to aid in the search for bodies. So many relief missions are gearing up that planes are reportedly having to circle the Banda Aceh before landing. But for those struggling to survive here, the feeling is that it is about time. Before they found themselves at the epicenter of this week's disaster, the seas bordering this once picturesque city were a peaceful place to wade or fish for kerapu. All that changed in an instant on Sunday morning. Yusmadi Sulaiman, 60, a delivery man, was shaken awake, as were many of his neighbors. He then found himself and his wife and four children fleeing a massive wave that rose above the coconut trees on his street near the shore here. He clung to a tree with his 4-year-old son in his arms, but the boy slipped away into the raging waters. His wife, a short distance away, held on to their 8-month-old daughter and called to her husband. ''Hold me, Bang, hold me,'' she yelled, using the Indonesian term of reverence for a spouse, he recalled. He has not seen his wife or his four children since; he searches the streets for them, hoping they may still be alive. ''Maybe there's a chance,'' he said as he sat by candlelight in a friend's home, with the electricity out. As he told his story, Ucyusi Rusadi Pura, a businessman from Jakarta whose company employs him, rested his hand on Mr. Sulaiman's shoulder. ''It's not your fault, it's not your fault,'' he said. ''We're your family too, and we'll stand by you through all of this.'' All around the region, known even in this Muslim country for its strict adherence to Islam, similar stories of loss have represented a test of faith and left those who survived to wonder why. ''In Muslim society, God only gives us his goodness and we have to learn lessons from a disaster like this,'' said Zulkarnain, 33, a salesman who escaped the floodwaters with his family. ''This may be God saying he is angry with human conduct in the world.'' ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: RELIEF"
"As Asia suffers through a 9/11 of its own a natural calamity instead of a man-made one, but at least 25 times more deadly -- President Bush's response in coming weeks may well determine his success in repairing relations strained by three years of relentless American focus on terrorism. It took 72 hours after the tsunamis washed away countless villages and tens of thousands of lives before Mr. Bush appeared in public to declare that the United States had the rudiments of a plan for addressing ''loss and grief to the world that is beyond our comprehension.'' His aides said it took that long to understand the magnitude of the tragedy and to plan a recovery effort that must stretch from remote villages of Indonesia to the eastern coast of Africa. But the aid effort that has now begun presents Mr. Bush with an opportunity to battle, with action rather than just words, the perception that took root in his first four years in office that he is all about America first. ''It's a tragedy but it is also an opportunity to demonstrate that terrorism doesn't drive out everything else,'' said Morton Abramowitz, who served as American ambassador to Thailand a quarter century ago and went on to become one of the founders of the International Crisis Group, which helps prepare governments to respond to unexpected shocks. ''It's a chance for him to show what kind of country we are.'' Mr. Bush and his aides have long argued that the administration's reputation around the world is undeserved. Andrew S. Natsios, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, said on Wednesday that American funds for disaster relief alone were $2.4 billion last year, 40 percent of the worldwide contributions for this purpose. ''We are by far the largest donor,'' he said. ''No one even comes close to us.'' That argument underlay the president's testy response when asked, at his ranch, about the comments of Jan Egeland, the United Nations relief coordinator, who charged on Monday that rich Western nations had been ''stingy'' in doling out foreign aid before the tsunami. ''I felt like the person who made that statement was very misguided and ill informed,'' Mr. Bush replied, ticking off the magnitude of increases in American aid. But perceptions set in a first term have a way of becoming the political canvas of the second. And America's response to this tragedy, some administration officials acknowledged, is crucial in places like Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, where the earthquake and tsunami first hit and where Islamic fundamentalism, never a political force during the cold war, is seeking to make inroads. Any missteps by the United States in the country's politically volatile environment, noted a senior American official who is frequently in Southeast Asia, ''will be exploited by the Islamic extremists to bolster their own case.'' In this case, early reports indicate that even in a holiday week, the bureaucracy swung into gear fairly quickly. To some degree, the war of perceptions has to do with whether the Asian nations believe Mr. Bush focuses on the tsunami tragedy with the same kind of energy he put in to making sure that other nations signed on to his counterterrorism agenda after Sept. 11. Just weeks after those attacks, Mr. Bush traveled to Shanghai for the annual summit of Asian leaders and made clear he would judge allies on the basis of how well they joined the fight. Among the first visitors to the Oval Office after the attack was Megawati Sukarnoputri, then Indonesia's president. She pledged to join the hunt for Al Qaeda operatives on her territory, and largely made good on the promise. On Wednesday morning Mr. Bush, operating from a trailer just across the road from his ranch that has been converted into a secure communications center, called the leaders of Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia and India to pledge his support. ''I assured those leaders this is only the beginning of our help,'' he said of the $35 million that the administration has pledged so far. Mr. Bush's aides are aware that the depth of America's compassion will be compared to what other nations are spending, what Washington spends on lesser disasters at home, and what is now being spent in Iraq. Spain has publicly committed about $68 million. Australia has pledged $27 million. American officials say those comparisons can be misleading because the United States is providing airlift and other services in an aid coalition with Japan, India and Australia. Then there are the domestic comparisons. Congress has approved roughly $13 billion for aid related to the hurricanes that hit the country in the late summer. Most of that is going to Florida, where Mr. Bush loaded fresh water and dry goods into the trunks of cars. Of course, that was home turf, and an election campaign was under way, and even Mr. Bush's critics do not expect spending on that scale for the far greater disaster in South Asia. And there are already signs that Democrats want to link the response to this disaster to spending in Iraq. ''I just about went through the roof when I heard them bragging about $35 million,'' Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat and a persistent critic of how the American rebuilding operation has gone in Iraq. ''We spend $35 million before breakfast in Iraq.'' Speaking by telephone from his home in Vermont, Mr. Leahy, who is the ranking Democrat on the foreign operations subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, urged that a portion of the largely unspent $18 billion for Iraq reconstruction be re-directed for Asian relief efforts. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: DIPLOMACY"
"The world's most powerful earthquake in 40 years erupted underwater off the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Sunday and sent walls of water barreling thousands of miles, killing more than 13,000 people in half a dozen countries across South and Southeast Asia, with thousands more missing or unreachable. The earthquake, which measured 9.0 in magnitude, set off tsunamis that built up speeds of as much as 500 miles per hour, then crashed into coastal areas of Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Indonesia, the Maldives and Malaysia as 40-foot-high walls of water, devouring everything and everyone in their paths. Its force was felt more than 3,000 miles away in Somalia on the eastern coast of Africa, where nine people were reported killed. Aid agencies were rushing staff and equipment to the region, warning that rotting bodies were threatening health and water supplies. It took several hours in some cases on Sunday for the waves to build and reach their targets after the earthquake struck. But none of the most affected countries had warning systems in place to detect the coming onslaught and alert their citizens to move away from the coastline. ''I just couldn't believe what was happening before my eyes,'' Boree Carlsson, 45, of Sweden, told Reuters from a hotel in the Thai resort of Phuket. ''As I was standing there, a car actually floated into the lobby and overturned because the current was so strong.'' A tsunami -- the term is Japanese -- is a series of waves generated by underwater seismic disturbances, in this case the interface of the India and Burma tectonic plates. Seismologists with the United States Geological Survey said the ocean west of Sumatra and the island chains to its north was a hot zone for earthquakes because of a nonstop collision occurring there between the India plate, beneath the Indian Ocean seabed, and the Burma plate under the islands and that part of the continent. The India plate is moving at about two inches a year to the northeast, creating pressure that releases, sporadically, in seismic activity. But this was an especially devastating earthquake, the fourth most powerful in 100 years. Television images showed bodies floating in muddied waters. Cars went out to sea; boats came onto land. Snorkelers were dragged onto the beach, and sunbathers out to sea, Simon Clark, a photographer who was vacationing on Ngai Island in Thailand, told The Associated Press. Indonesia reported nearly 4,500 dead, most in the Banda Aceh area of Sumatra, a region that has been the site of a continuing civil war. In Sri Lanka, at least 6,000 were dead. In India, an estimated 2,300 died, with at least 1,700 confirmed dead in Tamil Nadu, the southern state that is home to this coastal city of Madras, officially known as Chennai. At least three Americans were reported killed, two in Sri Lanka and one in Thailand, according to Noel Clay, a State Department spokesman. The death toll is expected to climb, and world leaders, from President Bush to Pope John Paul II, expressed grief and called for aid for the victims. Many areas from the atolls of the Maldives to the Nicobar Islands of India were simply out of reach, with communication lines snapped. Thousands more people in those places are feared marooned or dead. India's home minister, Shivraj Patil, said there was no communication with 45,000 residents of the Nicobar Islands. On Marina Beach here in Madras, women selling fish and children playing cricket, morning walkers and tourists savoring the salt-scented air all died as the sea suddenly turned enemy. The water came with no warning, said S. Muttukumar, a fisherman. ''We see the sea come forward,'' he said, describing how he ran and then swam from the 40-foot wave, grabbing onto catamarans for life support. ''Everybody was running, but God saves little.'' In the lanes of his village across from Marina Beach, four middle-aged women, all fish sellers who had been unable to outrun the waves, lay embalmed in refrigerated glass cases, prepared for cremation on Tuesday. Here, Mr. Muttukumar said, the water had come up off the beach an extra 500 yards to the main road, lingered for about 10 minutes, then receded as if it had never been there at all, leaving the fishermen to fish for bodies. Early Monday morning, the beach was still littered with fishing boats and upended hand carts. At the decrepit Madras General Hospital, a board listed 38 dead. Twelve were unknown; the rest ranged in age from 4 to 87. The waves struck tourist resorts from Phuket in Thailand to Bentota in Sri Lanka at the peak of the tourist and holiday season, meaning that livelihoods will be devastated long after the count of lost lives is done. Whole fishing villages were washed away along coastlines, and thousands of fisherman who unknowingly put out to sea in the morning are missing. An Indian Air Force base on Car Nicobar Island was virtually washed away, according to television reports, and late reports suggested that at least 1,000 could be dead on the Nicobar Islands. The airport in Male, the capital of the Maldives, was closed, stranding foreign tourists overnight at the airport in Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital, after much of Male was submerged. The casualties spread across southern India: at least 200 dead in Andhra Pradesh state, 80 in Kerala, and 280 in Pondicherry. Sri Lanka, the island nation to India's south, was battered on both its east and west coasts. The Sri Lankan government declared a national disaster, and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the rebel group that controls swaths of northern and eastern Sri Lanka, said it would declare its own national emergency. The Tamilnet Web site cited reports from the Tamil Relief Organization that 1,000 bodies had been brought to hospitals in the north and east, with the toll expected to rise. Reuters reported looting in Sri Lanka, and officials said that at least 200 prisoners had escaped from a prison in Matara, about 100 miles south of Colombo, after it was damaged by the tsunami. In southern Thailand, more than 400 people were dead, according to news agencies. Among them were foreign tourists who had come to vacation at the area's popular beach resorts. Emergency workers rescued about 70 Thai and foreign divers from the famed Emeral Cave, and dozens were evacuated from around other islands, Reuters reported. Two Thais were killed at Emeral cave. India, reeling from its own casualties, found itself trying to assist its smaller neighbors. It sent five naval warships to Sri Lanka loaded with relief supplies and fielded an offer for similar help from the Maldives. The Indian government also issued a warning that residents should stay at least one kilometer, or six-tenths of a mile, away from the sea for the next two days for fear of aftershocks and more tsunamis. But even without further calamity, the devastation will take weeks to unfold and years to repair. Officials in some areas expressed concern that saline water could contaminate drinking water and ruin arable land. Hundreds of thousands of people are homeless, crowded into unsanitary temporary shelters, and bodies are likely to wash up for days. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: DISASTER Correction: December 29, 2004, Wednesday A map on Monday with an article about the devastation in southern Asia mislabeled the capital of Bangladesh. It is Dhaka. (Dakar is the capital of Senegal, in Africa.)"
"The location of yesterday's devastating earthquake came as no surprise. Its epicenter lay just off the western tip of Sumatra in one of the most geologically violent regions on the planet, where two of the plates that make up the earth's surface collide. The tremor was the fourth most powerful quake in the past hundred years, and early estimates put the death toll at 13,000, a number that is likely to be revised sharply upward in the days to come. Hundreds of thousands of people have been left homeless. Most of the deaths were caused by tsunamis, enormous walls of water generated by the earth's sudden movement and flung outward through the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. The force of an earthquake in the midst of a landmass is damped by the land itself, which is why most of the damage occurs near the epicenter. But this earthquake's epicenter lay under water, which carries the energy of the quake hundreds of miles, until the tsunamis it generates crash onto shore. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the classic signs of a tsunami just before disaster struck. The water receded abruptly from land and then rose in a 40-foot wall, literally sweeping beaches clean from Thailand to India and Sri Lanka, which suffered the worst damage. The immediate destruction was bad enough. But for at least the next few days the sea will be returning the bodies and the debris it swept away, raising the risk of disease. Finding higher ground may have saved lives in some places, but in many of the islands and low-lying coastal areas, there was no higher ground to seek. The tsunamis are a reminder of how many people in this part of the world live nearly at sea level. It's instinctive in humans to search for the meaning of an event like this, once shock and grief have begun to subside. And there will be plenty of meanings to find in the ways that humans reacted as this disaster struck and in its aftermath as the relief effort begins. But except for our obligations to help the victims in any way we can, the underlying story of this tragedy is the overpowering, amoral mechanics of the earth's surface, the movement of plates that grind and shift and slide against each other with profound indifference to anything but the pressures that drive them. Whenever those forces punctuate human history, they do so tragically. They demonstrate, geologically speaking, how ephemeral our presence is. Editorial"
"Disaster crept up on them deceptively, the villagers said, then pounced. ''We were just relaxing here after finishing our morning work,'' said J.W. Kanti, whose work consists of cooking, washing and caring for her children. ''All of a sudden the water from the sea rose up close to our houses. Then it went out again. We all stood and watched.'' It withdrew for 1,000 yards, said Christoper Fernando, 30, an electrician, scraping the seabed dry behind it. ''The stones looked like elephants!'' said his neighbor Emil Chandradase. The people who lost everything here in Sri Lanka in Sunday's earthquake were among the country's poorest, mostly subsistence fishermen who lived between the rocky shoreline and the railroad tracks. Officials say as many as 4,500 people are known to have died in Sri Lanka, one of the most severely hit nations, and that perhaps 500,000 are homeless. The death toll is certain to rise as more people are determined to be missing from seaside villages like this one. No one died here in Dehiwala, a village south of the capital, Colombo, but hundreds have been left homeless, including 600 people who are taking refuge on the brightly lighted grounds of a Buddhist temple. Mr. Fernando said the fishermen rushed to secure their boats, in vain. ''Then all of a sudden, after a few minutes, the water came back again in a huge wall and we ran, and all our houses were turned into junk.'' A huge wind rose for a moment, whipping the four palm trees that stand near his house. ''We just grabbed our kids and ran,'' he said. ''That's all we managed to save.'' One of those taking refuge at the temple was Aslin Gomus, 58, whose voice was hoarse from shouting. ''The water came, and I started screaming,'' she said. ''I screamed and screamed. I saved a lot of children.'' But when she was asked, many hours later, she said she had no idea what she had been shouting. Her niece Kumari Mendis, 29, said she took up the cry, ''The water is coming!'' ''We were so scared,'' Ms. Mendis said. ''I thought maybe we will die now. We were just running. Thank God nobody is dead. But everything is gone. Everything is nothing.'' Before they told their tales, they seemed to be bundles of rags lying along the rocky shore by the railroad tracks. Suddenly they were up and running for their lives in panic. ''The water is coming again!'' came the shout. ''Get up! Run!'' Under the moonlight early Monday, the ocean shrugged and rolled uncomfortably, spitting bits of white froth like a sick man, but it held its peace. The morning before, it sucked their boats and belongings out to sea and left them ragged, homeless and terrified. The devastated shoreline is a portrait of the poverty here, littered with the trash that had furnished these people's lives -- a cup, a tin plate, a car battery, broken chairs, a light fixture, piles of tattered clothing. Here and there a small fishing boat lies on its side. Armed police officers and soldiers patrol the ruins, followed by stray cats. The people here say looters appeared in their homes almost simultaneously with the waves. Namal Ekanayake, a police subinspector, sat on a salvaged plastic chair near the battered Dehiwala railroad stop. He said he was ready to flee at a moment's notice, with his men. ''We can't predict anything regarding the scene,'' he said. A full moon glittered off the waves behind him and the surf was drowsy and soothing. The people say they are counting on aid from their government and abroad to start their lives again. So far, they have received plastic jugs of drinking water -- five bottles for 50 people in one small settlement. Electricity is gone, and here and there along the railroad tracks, people have set fire to tires, whose black smoke and orange flames provide light. ''Our boats are gone; our nets are gone,'' Nimal Bandare, 38, a fishermen, said with a small laugh of despair. ''Now we have nothing but the clothes we are wearing. All we had was fishing. There is nothing else for us to do but stand here and watch,'' he said. Giri Anadaradah, a shopkeeper, said, ''We hear on the radio that it will come again and next time it may be worse.'' Ms. Anadaradah, 33, referred to predictions of aftershocks after the major undersea earthquake that sent tidal waves up the shores of half a dozen or more countries. If it comes again, the people here will be ready. ''We will run, run, all run,'' said Pishante Kamala, standing beside the collapsed remains of her small wooden shanty at the end of the shore. ''Look! Look at the waves.'' ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: HOMELESS"
"The waves were gargantuan -- some as tall as a three-story house and a hundred miles wide -- and as they raced outward, spanning 3,000 miles of the Indian Ocean, crossing time zones and cultures and striking the coasts of many countries, the killing and destruction were brutal and indiscriminate. Sunbathers and snorkelers at luxury resorts swept out to sea. Hindus drowned during ritual bathing. A battered orphanage and missing children. Entire villages washed away. Fishing boats smashed. Homes, churches, cars, buses, livestock gone. A lighthouse toppled. A prison wrecked and the inmates gone. And when the water receded, beaches strewn with the dead, bodies in treetops and a girl impaled on a fence. Washed From the Beach It was just after breakfast time on Ngai Island, one of the many resorts on Thailand's west coast that welcome Asians and Europeans seeking to escape winter's cold. Simon Clark, 29, a photographer from London, looked out on an almost idyllic scene: sunbathers lying on the pristine beach, and in the water, snorkelers bobbing in the gentle waves out near the sharp-edged but beautiful coral reefs. The deadly wave was unimaginably big, stretching to the horizons, and it struck suddenly, looming up with a roar like a monster from the deep. It buried everyone, everything. It was over quickly, Mr. Clark told The Associated Press. ''People that were snorkeling were dragged along the coral and washed up on the beach,'' he said, ''and people that were sunbathing got washed into the sea.'' Swimming With the Dead Gemunu Amarasinghe, an A.P. reporter in Sri Lanka, was driving on a coastal road when he heard that a huge wave had struck the island. Shortly afterward, he noticed people fleeing and saw waves running in. They did not seem big. ''The waves brought fish to the shore and some young boys rushed to catch them,'' Mr. Amarasinghe recalled. Soon, however, a devastating second series of waves began rolling in. These were huge. ''Water started climbing,'' he said. He scrambled to the roof of his jeep, but it was not high enough. ''The water kept coming. In a few minutes my jeep was under water.'' He waded and swam away. ''I joined masses of people in escaping to high land,'' Mr. Amarasinghe said. ''Some carried their dead and injured loved ones. Some of the dead were eventually placed at the roadside, and covered with sarongs. Others walked past dazed, asking if anyone had seen their family members.'' After 15 minutes, the water began to recede, and he saw her. ''The twisted limbs of the frail-bodied girl were caught in a garden fence near the sea,'' he recalled. ''She may have died, but no one stopped -- there was already too much tragedy around her to check.'' In Sri Lanka, torn apart by years of civil war, the waves killed more than 4,500 people in areas controlled by the government; another 1,500 deaths were reported by Tamil rebels who control part of the country. On a four-mile beach, an A.P. photographer saw dozens of bodies, many of them children tangled in the wire mesh used to protect seaside homes from erosion. Others were brought up from the beaches, wrapped in sarongs and laid on the roads, while survivors searched for loved ones. A Ritual Is Shattered For the Hindus of Manginapudi Beach, a village in Andhra Pradesh state on India's southeast coast, it was an auspicious occasion -- Full Moon Day -- and the women and children had stepped gently into the edge of the sea for ritual bathing. It had been a pleasant, sunny Sunday morning. Then, without warning, the sea turned ferocious. Waves as high as coconut palms loomed up and over the bathers. Omer Farooq, an A.P. writer, said dozens were dragged out to sea. A subsequent wave threw the lifeless bodies of 17 women and 15 children back up on shore. People fell upon them, trying to administer mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, pumping seawater from their bellies, but it was no use. ''It is such a tragedy,'' Venkaratnam, a villager who uses only one name, told Mr. Farooq. He was a portrait of exhaustion, clad only in a sarong, and drenched. ''We tried our best to save these people, but could not do anything for them.'' A Family's Pain ''I am cursed with a long life,'' Jayanti Lakshmi, 70, said as she wailed over the bodies of her only son and her twin grandsons in Cuddalore, a village in India's southeastern Tamil Nadu state. For generations, fishermen and their families in Cuddalore and hundreds of villages like it have lived their hard lives upon the sea and in the flimsy shacks ashore that were swept away yesterday. When the great wave came, to her great sorrow, Mrs. Lakshmi was not in its path. ''My daughter-in-law and I had gone shopping, so we weren't home when the sea entered our hut,'' Mrs. Lakshmi told The A.P. ''I wish I had died instead of the others. My daughter-in-law would have a life -- I can't bear to watch her pain.'' At the Heart of the Quake The province at the northern tip of the Indonesian island of Sumatra is called Aceh, and because the epicenter of the undersea earthquake was only 155 miles south-southwest of Banda Aceh, the capital, the death and destruction across the province was heavy, a combination of temblor and tsunami forces. Whole towns were inundated. Dozens of buildings were destroyed. Trees and power lines were toppled, bridges collapsed, communications were severed. A prison at Pidie was knocked apart, and 204 inmates fled. Buses and cars were overturned and abandoned, roads were washed away, tens of thousands were homeless and at least 3,000 were dead. Many were children under 10 whose parents could not hold on. ''People just drowned,'' a woman screamed in pictures broadcast on television. ''They just drowned!'' As night fell, Lt. Col. Belyuni, the military chief for North Aceh district, spoke to El Shinta radio. ''We have stopped recovering bodies and will begin again first thing in the morning,'' he said. ''It is possible the death toll will mount because many corpses are still caught up in trees.'' The Waves' Reach In Somalia, on the Horn of Africa, 3,000 miles across the Indian Ocean from the epicenter of the quake, at least nine people were killed by a giant wave that destroyed homes, capsized boats and washed victims out to sea. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: SNAPSHOTS"
"From President Bush to Pope John Paul II, the world's political and spiritual leaders urged support on Sunday for victims of the giant waves in Asia as relief agencies and governments girded to offer technical help and aid. The United States said assistance was already on its way to some of the most stricken areas. The speed and scale of the disaster -- with thousands dead -- left some relief specialists struggling to keep pace with events. ''The needs are enormous,'' said Louis Michel, a senior official of the European Union, which offered $4 million in emergency funds. In Geneva, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said as many as 500,000 survivors could need help for the next six months. It appealed for some $6.5 million to finance relief efforts. Usually, in major catastrophes, relief agencies seek to meet the basic needs of survivors for shelter, clean water, food and medicines coupled with longer-term aid to help stricken regions to restore water supplies and rebuild themselves. But those efforts can founder because of poor communications and bad roads that prevent relief supplies from reaching affected areas. Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, said he was ''profoundly saddened to learn of the massive loss of life and destruction.'' He said the United Nations ''stands ready to provide the assistance necessary to meet the needs created by these natural disasters.'' Trent Duffy, the deputy White House spokesman, said in a statement: ''On behalf of the American people, the president expresses his sincere condolences for the terrible loss of life and suffering caused by the earthquake and subsequent tsunamis in the region of the Bay of Bengal. The United States stands ready to offer all appropriate assistance to those nations most affected including Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Thailand and Indonesia, as well as the other countries impacted. ''Already relief is flowing to Sri Lanka and the Maldives,'' the statement continued. ''We will work with the affected governments, the United Nations, nongovernmental organizations, and other concerned states and organizations to support the relief and response to this terrible tragedy.'' In the region itself, President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan urged a ''swift and concerted'' response from international donors and said Pakistan would send tents, medicines and water to Sri Lanka, one of the countries hit by the huge waves. In India, where more than 2,400 people were reported killed, the government sent naval vessels and aircraft laden with food and medicine to its southern coastline and to Sri Lanka. India is no stranger to natural disaster, including the earthquake in 2000 that killed 20,000 people in Gujarat. Offers of on-the-ground help and financial support came from Ireland, Britain, Kuwait and Turkey, among others. Jack Straw, the British foreign secretary, said, ''For all the huge advances in the control of our lives through science and technology, an earthquake on this scale is truly humbling as well as profoundly tragic for everyone involved.'' Queen Elizabeth II said she was ''deeply saddened.'' The queen is the titular head of the Commonwealth, an assembly mainly of former British colonies of which India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Malaysia are members. Relief agencies in France, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Italy, Israel, Russia and Greece indicated that the focus of their initial efforts would be in Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital. Doctors Without Borders, an international aid group, said in a statement posted on its Web site that it had staff on standby to fly to Indonesia and would send teams to India, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Burma. Jackie Flowers, a spokesperson for the American Red Cross, said Sunday that Red Cross and Red Crescent organizations in the region had begun to deploy staff and volunteers. Pope John Paul offered prayers for the victims during his customary noon appearance from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square at the Vatican. ''The Christmas holiday has been saddened by the news that comes from Southeast Asia about the powerful earthquake which struck Indonesia, with consequences in other countries, including Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia and the Maldives,'' the pope said. ''Let us pray for the victims of this enormous tragedy and assure them of our solidarity for all those who suffer, while we hope that the international community acts to bring relief to the stricken populations,'' he said. ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: RELIEF Correction: January 8, 2005, Saturday An article on Jan. 1 about the global relief effort for Asian nations struck by the tsunami misstated the Bush administration's first pledge of aid. (Several later articles about the disaster also misstated the first pledge.) The administration pledged $4 million on Dec. 27 for the International Red Cross and raised the figure to $15 million later that day for the total American effort. That figure was raised to $35 million on Dec. 28 and to $350 million on Dec. 31. The first pledge was neither $35 million nor $15 million."
"The earthquake that struck northwest of Sumatra, Indonesia, at dawn yesterday was a perfect wave-making machine, and the lack of a tsunami warning system in the Indian Ocean essentially guaranteed the devastation that swept coastal communities around southern Asia, experts said. Although waves swamped parts of the Sumatran coast and nearby islands within minutes, there would have been time to alert more distant communities if the Indian Ocean had a warning network like that in the Pacific, said Dr. Tad Murty, an expert on the region's tsunamis who is affiliated with the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg. Within 15 minutes of the earthquake, in fact, scientists running the existing tsunami warning system for the Pacific, where such waves are far more common, sent an alert from their Honolulu hub to 26 participating countries, including Thailand and Indonesia, that destructive waves might be generated by the Sumatra tremors. But there was no way to convey that information speedily to countries or communities an ocean away, said Dr. Laura S.L. Kong, a Commerce Department seismologist and director of the International Tsunami Information Center, an office run under the auspices of the United Nations. Phone calls were hurriedly made to countries in the Indian Ocean danger zone, she said, but not with the speed that comes from pre-established emergency planning. ''Outside the Pacific these things don't occur very often at all so the challenge is how to make people and government officials aware,'' she said. Tsunamis, sometimes referred to as tidal waves but having nothing to do with tidal forces, are generated when an earthquake, eruption or landslide abruptly moves the seabed, jolting the waters above. Resulting waves can cross thousands of miles of deep ocean at near jetliner speeds as near-invisible disturbances before welling up in shallower coastal waters to heights of 30 feet or more. But even at such speeds, prompt warnings can provide ample time to evacuate people, Dr. Murty and other experts said. The Pacific network of stations gauging wave and earthquake activity is able to alert potential targets within minutes. Tsunamis have swept the Indian Ocean, as well, oceanographers said yesterday, noting one that killed several hundred people near Bombay in 1945 and another -- one of the earliest tsunamis recorded in the region -- that ravaged what is now Bangladesh and other parts of the Bay of Bengal in 1762. With population densities enormously high in many parts of coastal southern Asia, the region should have started setting up such a network long ago, said Dr. Murty, who is originally from India. Other scientists have voiced similar concerns. At a meeting in June of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, a United Nations body, experts concluded that the ''Indian Ocean has a significant threat from both local and distant tsunamis'' and should have a warning network. But Dr. Murty said India, Thailand, Malaysia and other countries in the region ''see this as a Pacific problem.'' ''I have a feeling that after this tragedy that may change,'' he said. The earthquake near Sumatra was the fifth most potent in the world in the last 100 years and the worst in 40 years, registering a magnitude of 9.0. It was followed by more than a dozen aftershocks, but none of those were expected to produce dangerous waves, federal geologists said. The quake occurred at one of the many seams in the ever-shifting crust of the earth where one plate slips beneath another in an incessant, but spasmodic process. In this case, the quake was set off by an abrupt slippage along 700 miles of the seam where the plate beneath the Indian ocean slides under the Indonesian archipelago. This caused a vast stretch of seabed to shift about 50 feet, said geologists at the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo. The biggest danger from earthquakes on land tends to come when the earth heaves horizontally, as is the case along the San Andreas fault in California. But faults where earthquakes tend to cause abrupt vertical motion, like the ones along western Indonesia, pose the biggest risk of generating tsunamis because they can act like a giant piston, deforming the sea. In such submarine earthquakes, gravity and the incompressibility of water force the seas above to react immediately to the change thousands of feet below. ''You're taking hundreds of miles of ocean bottom and moving it dozens of feet,'' said David Wald, a seismologist at the center. ''That displaces a huge amount of water. The water at the surface starts to shift downhill and that makes a tsunami.'' Most research on such waves and efforts to create warning systems have focused on the Pacific, where the Ring of Fire, a great arcing seam of volcanic and tectonic activity, causes a significant tsunami about once a decade. One of the first efforts to alert communities to impending tsunamis came in Hawaii in the 1920's, said Dr. George D. Curtis, a tsunami expert affiliated with the University of Hawaii at Hilo. A geologist at Hawaii's volcano observatory, upon detecting telltale tremors, would call local harbor officials and tell them to have boats moved to safety, Dr. Curtis said. Efforts greatly intensified in 1946, after a powerful earthquake in the Aleutian island chain of Alaska unexpectedly sent waves smashing into Hawaii, killing more than 150 people. In 1948, the United States created its Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, which has been linked to an international data and warning network since 1965. Any underwater earthquake with a magnitude greater than 6.5 starts the process, Dr. Murty said, and if a single wave gauge signals that the ocean is reacting, an alert is issued. But there has been little work done outside the Pacific, other than informal discussions, to expand the tsunami monitoring network. ''There's no reason for a single individual to get killed in a tsunami,'' Dr. Murty said. ''The waves are totally predictable. We have travel-time charts covering all of the Indian Ocean. From where this earthquake happened to hit, the travel time for waves to hit the tip of India was four hours. That's enough time for a warning.'' ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: SCIENCE"
"More than 11 years after scientists predicted it would occur, a strong earthquake rocked the Central California town of Parkfield on Tuesday morning, triggering almost 200 aftershocks and sending emergency crews scrambling in a radius of several hundred miles. No serious injuries were reported, and there appeared to be only relatively light damage in the sparsely populated region. Power was knocked out for a time in Parkfield, where residents, some wearily accustomed to a trembling earth, said objects vibrated off shelves and some walls were cracked. ''It gives you a bit of anxiety,'' said Louis Schmitz, an equipment inspector who lives between Parkfield and Paso Robles, where two women were killed last December by a falling building during an earthquake. ''This one kind of rolled through and then settled down.'' Parkfield, a rural town of about 40 people, lies virtually atop the San Andreas fault, the largest and most active of California's seismic fissures. Because of its location, Parkfield is a virtual laboratory for seismologists, who have placed a large number of measuring instruments in the area, which has the reputation of California's earthquake capital. Six moderate earthquakes -- in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966 -- have shaken Parkfield since the start of record-keeping. Given the area's history, scientists estimated that strong earthquakes were likely to occur there every 22 years or so. Because the ground had been quiet since 1966, and because of the average 22-year lull between quakes, the United States Geological Survey issued an official prediction two decades ago that another earthquake would occur in Parkfield in 1988, or at least before 1993. Seismologists converged on the area, laying down a variety of instruments to note every nuance when the ground broke and moved. They waited. The years passed, and the ground remained quiet; 1988 passed. So did 1993. The failure of the Parkfield prediction deflated most hopes that reliable earthquake forecasts could be made. ''Today we had that earthquake,'' Dr. Andrew J. Michael, a geophysicist at the United States Geological Survey, said during a telephone news conference Tuesday afternoon. When he heard earlier in the day that an earthquake had struck Parkfield, Dr. Michael said he felt ''a very strange mix of emotions'' -- both shock that the quake that he had waited for 16 years had finally occurred and anticipation of the wealth of data that can now be explored. The instruments from the 1980's experiment are still there, and more have been added since. A 10,000-foot-deep hole for the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth, an ambitious effort to explore the geology of earthquakes, was recently completed near Parkfield, but instruments had not yet been lowered into the hole. But instruments in a separate 7,000-foot-deep test hole that had been drilled earlier recorded data. ''This should have a very rich scientific payoff, once the scientists can catch their breaths and analyze some of the data,'' said Dr. Michael Blanpied, associate director for the geological survey's earthquake hazards program. On Tuesday, the quake broke the earth exactly where the scientists had expected, the same spot that ruptured in 1934 and 1966. And it was as strong as they had predicted -- magnitude 6.0."
"There is nothing more nerve-racking for many Californians than the unpredictable and irritable San Andreas fault, which leveled much of San Francisco the last time it kicked up a big earthquake in 1906. That might explain one of the more anxious questions commonly posed to several dozen scientists who gathered on a cattle ranch here on Thursday to marvel at a huge drill mounted on an 18-story rig, poking at the fault. Might the drilling not trigger an earthquake? ''We get asked that all the time,'' said one of the scientists, Kaye M. Shedlock, a geophysicist with the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Va. ''If drilling caused earthquakes, Texas would be incredibly seismically active. Drilling does not cause earthquakes.'' But the glimmer in Dr. Shedlock's eye hinted at the real reason she and the others had convened here for an unusual session of geologists, seismologists, geophysicists and other scientists intrigued by the mysteries of the San Andreas. ''In a sense, you hope it does happen,'' she said of an earthquake. ''We just want to make sure we have all of our instrumentation in place first.'' Dr. Shedlock was not talking about a Big One -- the kind that measured 7.9 on the Richter scale in 1906 -- but smaller 2.0 quakes that are not felt on the surface. Scientists chose the sunburned hills here for their drilling experiment because they straddle a section of the San Andreas that has a history of the so-called micro-earthquakes, about 30 of them in the past two decades alone. The more unstable stretches of the 750-mile tectonic cleavage are to the south and the north, though the Parkfield area, about halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, has had big jolts. Dubbed by the National Science Foundation as a modern-day journey to the center of the earth, the drilling here is part of a $250 million project called EarthScope that is studying the tectonics of North America. Though the scientists say the project is not intended to devise a way to predict earthquakes, that has been one of the biggest unspoken expectations since a test hole was drilled here two years ago. Kevin Kester, who owns the ranch where the $20 million rig and monitoring station share quarters with about 3,000 cattle, said that was his main motivation in opening the property to the experiment. ''My family have been ranchers since the 1860's and I was born and raised on this ranch,'' Mr. Kester, 49, said. ''Earthquakes are part of Mother Nature here. Hopefully this will help the scientific community predict when they are coming.'' The first phase of the San Andreas study ends this month as the hole being bored comes within 1,600 feet of the fault zone. After reviewing what has been gleaned, the scientists will push farther next summer, expecting to reach the seismically active fault zone in August or September. ''We are giddy with success right now,'' said Gregory van der Vink, the EarthScope project director. ''We are now turning the drill toward the fault and aiming it at the target earthquakes.'' Mark D. Zoback, a geophysics professor at Stanford University, said scientists in Japan had done shallow drilling near the Nojima fault in that country, but never before has anyone attempted to drill directly into a fault zone. When drilling is completed, the borehole will be about three miles long and about two miles deep. Scientists are using the drilling to study just about everything they can. Rocks and other sediments from the borehole are separated from the muddy mixture in the shaft and shipped to Texas for analysis. Even gasses like helium and hydrogen that seep into the borehole are being trapped and packaged for shipment to Germany, where they are to be studied by scientists in Potsdam. Dr. Zoback said no possible clue to the mechanics of the San Andreas was being overlooked, with more than 100 scientists from around the world eager to get a first-hand glimpse of the fault and to test a variety of hypotheses about earthquakes. Perhaps most important, the project involves placing instruments in the borehole that will measure the physical conditions of the fault zone. Already, data from instruments in other locations are being transmitted to computers in a lab next to the drilling rig, enough each day to fill 40 DVD's, or the equivalent of 100 books of 400 pages each. The material is also being posted on the Internet. ''Until now, our ability to study earthquakes has depended on the location of the nearest instrument,'' Dr. Zoback said. ''It is a science hampered by lack of direct knowledge from the fault zone. That is about to change.'' The actual drilling into the San Andreas is expected to be tricky. Dr. van der Vink said researchers had narrowed the most seismically active zone to an area about the size of a football field, but they wanted to be more precise, perhaps within 10 yards of the seismic activity. Several scientists said the drilling might be intrusive enough to set off one of the 2.0 magnitude quakes, but nothing larger. Mr. Kester, who joined the scientists at the drill site, said he was comfortable with the assurances. ''From the day I was 11 we have had scientific research on the ranch,'' he said. ''I don't worry about earthquakes.''"
