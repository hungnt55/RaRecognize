"In its bout with nature, this weary, sandbagged city held on this afternoon with an army of roaring water pumps that battled the cresting Mississippi River. This was the day that people here had prepared for, the day forecasters had predicted that the river would peak at near-record levels, testing the sandbag levees as well as the will of this city of 98,600. But if this was the last and decisive round against the Mississippi, by the end of the day people here were worn and weary, but still standing. The river tonight neared its record crest of 22.6 feet in 1993, 7.5 feet above flood stage, but it was expected to fall just short of that mark. By 11 p.m. tonight, it had risen to 22.3 feet, the authorities said. The prediction for the crest was 22.5 feet. While municipal officials had their hands full fighting the river, they also spent part of the day defending their decision not to build a permanent flood wall along the river, a day after the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Joseph Allbaugh, criticized the city for failing to do so. After meeting with President Bush on Monday, Mr. Allbaugh told reporters that he would urge officials here and in other towns along the Mississippi to build permanent flood walls. ''How many times will the American taxpayer have to step in and take care of this flooding, which could be easily prevented by building levees and dikes?'' Mr. Allbaugh, who is scheduled to arrive here on Thursday, asked. Mr. Allbaugh added that he thought there ought to be a limit to federal emergency financing for cities in flood areas that did not construct permanent flood walls. Mayor Phil Yerington said residents of his city had not complained when their tax dollars paid for disaster recovery elsewhere. ''We are the American taxpayers,'' Mr. Yerington said. ''We certainly don't mind paying for the hurricane, tornado and earthquake damage that goes on in the rest of this country, and we'd like to think that we shouldn't be singled out because we live along the river.'' He said Mr. Allbaugh's criticisms were unfair to workers, volunteers and families, particularly as they were trying to save the city. ''My reaction is one to not let his remarks dampen the spirit of a community that has pulled together remarkably and has taken this fight against the river personally, and this time for the first in our history, is at least calling it a draw,'' Mr. Yerington said tonight. Asked today about Mr. Allbaugh's comments, Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said, ''There was no discussion in the meeting that Director Allbaugh had with the president about pressuring communities, Davenport included.'' Mr. Fleischer was asked what message Washington was sending to Davenport, and he replied, ''The message is, as Director Allbaugh indicated yesterday, that the United States government stands by and stands ready to help if necessary.'' City officials contend that they have made strides in protecting Davenport in recent years. Dee Bruemmer, the public works director, said the city had bought scores of homes in the flood plain over the last decade and had flood-proofed some downtown buildings. But Ms. Bruemmer said that fortifying the city against the river took time. The city has not built such floodwalls, partly because they would cut it off from the river. The riverfront remains an important component of Davenport's livelihood and history. At other river towns in Iowa and Illinois, national guards, volunteers and state prisoners laid sandbags in preparation for the arrival of the floods that Davenport and its northern neighbors have already had to confront. Gov. George Ryan of Illinois visited Niota, Ill., this morning to observe flood preparations; he added two more counties to those already under a state of emergency, raising the number to 10. Upstream in Davenport, downtown streets were closed. Water sprang from manhole covers, from cracks and crevices in streets yielding to the pressure of the river that has seeped underneath them. Water ran down sidewalks and flowed from pipes on the sides of buildings, and from just about everywhere the swollen river could find relief. Kim Anderson, 26, and her 3-year-old daughter, Aubrianna, squatted on dry land near River Drive, where four ducks waded. Ms. Anderson said she had lived through the flood of 1993 in Ottumwa, Iowa, in a trailer park. She lost her home in that flood, she said, and has lived in Davenport since July. But like most other people here, her family lives uphill, and their home is not affected by the flood. On Monday, high winds sent waves crashing against sandbags and raised serious concern here about whether they would withstand the river's onslaught. But today, the weather was mild and sunny, the wind considerably diminished. Still, about 200 city workers continue to battle the river, reinforcing the sandbags. About 150 National Guard troops also helped to monitor levees and sandbags, city officials said. If the worst was almost over, no one here was dropping his guard. John Field, 45, was among the crew of city workers helping reinforce sandbag dikes. By afternoon, he said the dikes were holding. ''It's probably going to come down to a decision,'' Mr. Field said of the city's fight against the river. ''But hopefully it'll be in our favor.''"
"With near-record floodwaters rolling down the Mississippi River once again, a debate has been reignited in the Midwest about how or even whether governments should try to protect the areas that might lie in rivers' paths. Since the devastating floods of 1993, the federal and state governments have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to buy and demolish nearly 13,000 homes and businesses along the Mississippi and its tributaries, essentially conceding that battling the waters was a losing fight. But more recently, communities near St. Louis have begun a surge of development across thousands of acres of the flood plain and are seeking federal assistance to raise levees ever higher. Critics say the plan reflects a dangerous hubris about the power to tame mighty rivers, and they say federal money would be better spent keeping structures away from the riverbanks. But signals from the Bush administration, which has scolded the sodden city of Davenport, Iowa, for not building a permanent flood wall, appear to suggest a preference for development over demolition. [Page A16.] In one move, the administration has said it intends to reduce to 50 percent from 75 percent the federal share of the Congressionally mandated program that acquires property in flood-prone areas and converts it to open space. It has also chosen not to renew a $160-million-a-year program to restore farmland to wetlands, which have a sponging capacity experts regard as important in reducing the severity of floods. At the same time, the Army Corps of Engineers is going forward with a $58 million program to help raise one levee just west of St. Louis, a project intended to protect strip malls and other development under way in the flood plain of the lower Missouri River. The Corps is also moving ahead on a controversial $60 million levee project in the southern part of the state that will close off one of the last remaining natural flood ways on the lower Mississippi. In this year's flooding, predictions so far say the high water will begin to dissipate as the crest moves southward, so that the flood will not come close to 1993 levels by the time it reaches the St. Louis area early next week. But televised scenes of damage in Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois have nevertheless been disturbing to people who live down river, including state officials and environmentalists in Missouri who say the construction of the new and bigger levees will only increase the potential for severe flooding elsewhere in the future. These critics also say that the development under way in the Missouri River flood plain, in cities like Chesterfield, Hazelwood and Maryland Heights, Mo., suggests that local planners are ignoring the lessons learned from the 1993 flood, including the wisdom of moving structures out of harm's way. ''Basically what we're seeing is continued use of the flood plain for inappropriate reasons,'' said Wayne Freeman, executive director of the Great Rivers Land Trust, a conservation organization based in St. Louis. Bob Shea, a senior official of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, conceded that the reduced federal contribution recommended in the budget proposal the White House has sent to Congress could have a ''fairly major impact'' on efforts to remove structures from flood-prone areas. But Mr. Shea said the administration believed that state and local governments should bear a greater share of the burden for the program, which turns the property over to local authorities. Mr. Shea said that the agency's new director, Joe Allbaugh, supported the structure-removal effort and was sensitive to the problems associated with building in the flood plain. But to other flood experts, Mr. Allbaugh's repeated criticism of the Mississippi River city of Davenport this week for its failure to build a flood wall that might have offered greater protection from high waters has seemed to suggest a misplaced inclination to emphasize structural approaches to flood protection. ''Davenport is not perfect, but it is close to a model for how to address flooding,'' said Tim Searchinger, a lawyer with Environmental Defense, a New York research and advocacy group. ''Yes, they don't have a flood wall, but for the most part, it has not built in the flood plain.'' In the aftermath of the 1993 floods, which caused some $10 billion in damage, a committee of government experts urged the Clinton administration to abandon the Army Corps of Engineers's longstanding preference for dams and levees to control floods. The report noted that flood damages in the United States had soared despite the billions of dollars spent on such structures, and it called for greater efforts to promote the evacuation of risky flood plains, the relocation of businesses and farms to higher ground and the restoration of natural flood cycles. The most significant outgrowth of those recommendations has been the program to buy flood-threatened property, which is now the biggest component of the federal disaster agency's stepped-up efforts at flood mitigation. Under laws passed by Congress since the 1993 floods, the federal emergency agency must devote at least 15 percent of its flood disaster relief spending to clearing land and to other projects aimed at preventing damage. In Missouri alone, said Buck Katt, the deputy director of the state's emergency management agency, the program has made possible the takeover of some 5,000 structures or parcels of land, at a cost of about $100 million, but with savings from future flood damage expected to be greater. Under the program, some Midwestern towns, like Valmeyer, Ill., have been transplanted house by house to higher ground; of the structures flooded in 1993, one in seven has either been moved from danger or no longer exists, Scott Faber, a lawyer with Environmental Defense, said. A condition of the program is that any land that is acquired must be deeded to prohibit construction. But still, most land along the Mississippi and its tributaries is not covered by such prohibitions, and the Army Corps of Engineers, which regulates construction on wetlands, has proven willing to issue the permits and assist in the levee building that have made the new flood-plain development possible. Among the biggest development projects is the one in Chesterfield, Mo., 20 miles west of St. Louis, where a levee built to withstand a 100-year flood was breached by the Missouri in 1993, causing $400 million worth of damage. There local authorities are about halfway finished with an upgrade that will raise its walls by as much as seven feet, to the level of a flood calculated as likely to occur only once in 500 years. Already, a business park and some light industry are in place in the part of the Missouri River flood plain that is to be protected by the higher walls, and more construction is under way or planned on thousands of acres of what was farmland. Congress last year authorized $58 million for the part of the levee project that is to be performed by the Corps of Engineers, but the money has not yet been appropriated. Further down river, 500-year levees are being built or planned to make development possible in Maryland Heights and Hazelwood, but these projects would be financed locally. David Human, the executive director of the Chesterfield levee district, said a study by the Corps had concluded that the benefits of the project would exceed the costs by a two to one ratio. Charles Camillo, a Corps spokesman, suggested that critics of such projects had exaggerated the link between development and the risk of flood. ''Floods aren't caused by levees, the loss of wetlands, navigation structures in rivers or flood-plain development, when taken alone,'' Mr. Camillo said. ''What causes floods is a lot of rainfall over a wide area over extended periods of time. Everything has to be evaluated as a whole, not as separate features.'' But critics of the projects say that the Corps's studies have failed to consider as a whole the effects of development under way in the St. Louis area, as well as the potential effect of the New Madrid levee project in southern Missouri, which has been advocated by the Corps to help protect farmland near the small town of East Prairie, Mo. A supplemental environmental impact study on the project, which is meant to address concerns raised by the state of Missouri, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Fish and Wildlife Service, is expected to be completed this fall. The biggest danger of levee construction, critics say, is that they constrict rivers between man-made boundaries, thus denying them space for flooding, and setting in motion an unhealthy race between communities to protect themselves with ever-higher barriers. ''When you build a levee, you're going to pay the price somewhere else, and there's no ifs, ands or buts about it,'' said Mr. Katt of the Missouri emergency agency."
"Archaeologists have found evidence that appears to support the theory that a catastrophic flood struck the Black Sea region more than 7,000 years ago, turning the sea saline, submerging surrounding plains and possibly inspiring the flood legends of Mesopotamia and the Bible. In their first scientific report, the expedition leaders said that a sonar survey in the sea off Sinop, a city on the northern coast of Turkey, conducted in the summer of 2000, revealed the first distinct traces of the preflood shoreline, now about 500 feet underwater. At one site, the sonar detected more than 30 stone blocks on a gently sloping but otherwise featureless bottom. Further investigation with remote controlled cameras revealed pieces of wood and other objects, possibly ceramics. The site ''appeared uniquely rectangular'' in the sonar image, and the stone blocks did not appear to be part of a natural geological formation, expedition scientists reported in today's issue of The American Journal of Archaeology. Analysis of core samples yielded chemical evidence that archaeologists said were consistent with the interpretation that the site was once occupied by people. ''The expedition clearly has found a subaquatic landscape with materials that belong to the period before the inundation,'' said Dr. Bruce Hitchner, an archaeologist at the University of Dayton, Ohio, and editor of the journal, a publication of the Archaeological Institute of America. ''They have confirmed an important element of the flood theory, quite convincingly I think.'' The expedition was led by Dr. Robert D. Ballard, an oceanographer and president of the Institute for Exploration in Mystic, Conn., and Dr. Fredrik T. Hiebert, an archaeologist at the University of Pennsylvania. The research was supported in part by the National Geographic Society. Among the expedition's most striking discoveries were four Roman and Byzantine shipwrecks, several of them surprisingly well preserved because of the oxygen-deficient waters at the bottom of the sea."
"Hurricane Michelle spared South Florida today, hitting the Bahamas instead with winds weakened by its deadly encounter with Cuba on Sunday. By noon, a tropical storm warning had been lifted for South Florida, and residents and tourists were returning to the Florida Keys after being evacuated the day before. Rain fell in in the early morning hours, but the sun peeked through briefly in the afternoon as winds died down. The rain caused minor flooding on some streets in the South Beach section of Miami Beach, and some oceanfront stores farther north, in Hollywood, reported flooding from high surf. In Miami, schools and businesses that were closed today were expected to reopen on Tuesday. In the Keys, there were no reports of serious damage, the authorities said. ''Things here are pretty much back to normal at this point,'' said Becky Herrin, a spokeswoman for the Sheriff's Department in Monroe County, which includes the Keys. ''People are taking their shutters down, and businesses are back open.'' Some businesses said the worst damage was to their profits. ''Our business has been slow since Sept. 11 and this really affects us,'' said Rob Bruening, co-owner of the Duval Inn in Key West. ''We were sold out for the week, and then they asked for everyone to evacuate, and we had to send everyone home.'' Tracking to the northeast, the storm hit the Bahamas today with winds of 80 miles an hour, causing some flooding in the capital, Nassau, on New Providence Island. Trees and utility lines were reported knocked down in other parts of the chain of islands. No deaths were reported. By late afternoon winds had dropped to 75 m.p.h., barely hurricane force, and the storm was rapidly moving away from the Bahamas. The storm was expected to continue to weaken in the next 24 hours, the National Hurricane Center said. The hurricane had spent much of its energy battering southwestern Cuba on Sunday. Winds of up to 135 m.p.h. ripped the roofs off buildings and felled trees, and high waves and tidal surges caused widespread flooding. It was the worst storm to hit Cuba in half a century. Five people were killed, bringing the death toll from the storm to 17 throughout the Caribbean. Some of Cuba's main sugar-producing provinces were hard hit, with cane fields flooded or destroyed by the winds, and some sugar mills damaged. Banana, coffee and citrus crops were damaged, and power was cut to nearly the entire country. With Cuba's sugar production already at historical lows, the government today mobilized thousands of workers to try to save some of this year's cane crop. President Fidel Castro traveled to the affected provinces to survey the damage, Reuters reported. ''Don't worry, we'll survive the hurricane,'' Mr. Castro said. ''For us, victory means having a minimum loss of human life.''"
"Barry Mandel, director of the downtown Theater District Association, stood outside Jones Hall today, home to the Houston Symphony, and listened not to violins but to the groan of a generator pumping water from the flooded bowels of the auditorium. Below, the music library may be ruined. Instruments are floating in chest-deep water. Across the street, the basement stage inside the Alley Theater was drenched, and the electrical system was broken. Next door at the Wortham Theater Center, the performance hall for the city's ballet and opera, the costumes for the coming performance of ''Cleopatra'' that were stored in the underground dressing rooms may be ruined. Like nearly everyone else in this bayou city, Mr. Mandel was stunned by the ferocity of Tropical Storm Allison, which was blamed for at least 20 deaths and which dropped nearly three feet of water in some places last weekend. But in explaining the tremendous flooding downtown, Mr. Mandel pointed not to the sky, but below, to a set of doors that opened into a tunnel. ''The water,'' he said, ''came from there.'' The explanation for the record flooding here last weekend is fairly simple. It rained so much and so fast that the drainage system in this table-top city laced with bayous was overwhelmed as neighborhoods became lakes and highways became canals. But downtown, the water also rushed down the ramps of parking garages and poured through some sections of the maze of tunnels that shield pedestrians from the weather and connect the city's signature skyscrapers, particularly around the Theater District, creating a flood above ground and below. ''This really was a flood that was totally out of the realm of experience or expectation down here,'' said Joseph Colaco, a University of Houston professor who worked as a structural engineer on many of the downtown skyscrapers. With floodwaters having receded, problems were still evident today even as life seemed fairly normal. Away from downtown, the Texas Medical Center, home to an array of hospitals and research institutions, continued to struggle with power failures and underground flooding. Officials with the Compaq Center canceled Thursday's game for the city's women's professional basketball team. Thousands of people continued to work on flooded homes and businesses. The arena is now dry, but during the flood the basketball court itself was floating on four feet of water. People returned to office buildings downtown today, but work crews continued furiously pumping water from below Jones Hall and other nearby buildings, including at least two skyscrapers. At the peak of the flooding early Saturday, the three-level underground parking garage for the Theater District was believed to be filled with 87 million gallons of water. Half of that amount must still be removed. Usually, the city beneath the city, is a respite from the weather. Just as people in Minneapolis can walk on skyways from building to building to stay warm in winter, Houstonians can move beneath the city during the boiling summers through the air-conditioned tunnels, as well as eat at underground food courts and shop at underground stores. Today, much of the tunnel system was unaffected and was open. Mr. Colaco, the structural engineer, characterized the flooding as unprecedented and said that problems downtown did not mean that the tunnels were prone to flooding. Houston is not the only American city to suffer underground flooding in its business and commercial district. In April 1992, the Chicago Loop was closed for a week when a freight tunnel under the Chicago River was breached, sending nearly 250 million gallons of water coursing through the city's tunnel system and into basements. City Hall and the Sears Tower, as well as the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, were closed by the flooding. The Houston flooding was at its worst in the Theater District, where the tunnels were transformed into rivers that flowed into the performance halls and wreaked considerable damage, if not to the main performance stages, then to nearly everything else. That flooding was accentuated by the district's location -- all four of the city's main performance halls face Jones Plaza, a short walk from the waters of Buffalo Bayou. The impact on the city's cultural life was immediate. Two performances of ''Giselle'' have been canceled, and the coming weekend performances are uncertain. ''The Carpetbagger's Children,'' the Horton Foote play that had its world premiere last week at the Alley Theater, has been moved to a theater a few miles away. Jennifer Garza, a spokeswoman for the Alley Theater, said that the basement-level stage being used for the Foote production was heavily damaged and that the theater's electrical system was not working. ''It suffered extensive damage from water that came in through the tunnel system,'' Ms. Garza said. She also said the theater's underground offices suffered greatly as water damaged artist renderings for set designs and other materials, ''things that are irreplaceable,'' Ms. Garza said. Air-conditioning and electrical power were restored today at the Wortham Theater Center. The above-ground parts of the building were mostly dry, but water poured through the underground hallways, dressing rooms and costume shops. Only today were officials with the ballet able to survey the damage. An earlier video taken by an employee sloshing through the hallways in chest waders showed toppled costume boxes, drenched dressing rooms and other extensive damage. Cecil C. Conner Jr., managing director of the Houston Ballet, said he feared for the condition of the costumes for the company's coming production of ''Cleopatra,'' a wardrobe for 50 dancers valued at $200,000, including the jeweled gown worn by the principal dancer, Lauren Anderson. A decision will be made later this week on whether the final performances of ''Giselle'' will be held this weekend, Mr. Conner said. ''There are lots of people who are making their debuts in 'Giselle,' '' he said, ''and some ballerinas are retiring. We don't want them to lose this opportunity, and we don't want the city to lose the opportunity to see them.'' None of the companies suffered more than the Houston Symphony. The main auditorium of Jones Hall sustained little damage, but offices below, as well as those of the Society for the Performing Arts, were all but destroyed. Water from the tunnels rushed through with such force that the glass walls of some offices were shattered. Computers were ruined and files waterlogged. Rehearsal halls were inundated. Art Kent, a symphony spokesman, said the immediate concern was the music library, with its thousands of scores from past performances. Mr. Kent said officials with NASA had already agreed to use freezing technology to try to save the music sheets. But until the water is fully pumped out, they cannot get to the scores and the delay decreases the chances of saving them. Christine Pastorek, a violinist who joined the symphony in 1969, called the library ''the lifeblood of your orchestra.'' Mr. Kent, the spokesman, said three Steinway pianos that were damaged were valued at $250,000. A double bass trapped in the room is valued at $100,000. If the flooding was horrific for the symphony, the timing was a little better. The symphony had just completed its subscription series at Jones Hall and will spend the summer performing for children and on an outdoor suburban stage. In fact, the first performance in the summer series was today. ''Many of us lost automobiles and had problems at home,'' Ms. Pastorek said of the floods, explaining why some musicians failed to attend today's concert. ''But we had a full complement on stage. Luckily, these stages are smaller.''"
"Tropical storm Allison -- which pounded the Texas and Louisiana coasts with rain -- killed 22 people, flooded more than 27,000 homes and wrought an estimated $2 billion in property damage in the Houston area alone. But as the floodwaters receded last week, researchers at the world's largest medical facility, the Texas Medical Center, grappled with a devastating loss of another kind: nearly 35,000 laboratory animals were drowned and decades of research were ruined when storm water gushed into its hospitals and research laboratories. The sudden storm's torrential rains flooded access roads, barring any rescue attempts. At the University of Texas Medical School at Houston, officials found 4,700 animals dead, including 78 monkeys, 35 dogs and several hundred rabbits; the Baylor College of Medicine lost more than 30,000 mice, rats and rabbits. Some had been specially bred over decades for scientific purposes. But even more crippling was the destruction or contamination of vast quantities of laboratory specimens and tissue, bacterial and chemical samples. Decades of experiment records were also lost when rising water fried lab computers' circuitry. The floods wiped out millions of dollars of federally funded research into cancer, muscular dystrophy, AIDS and other diseases, and it may be years before the full extent of the damage is known, said Dr. Arthur Beaudet, chairman of Baylor's department of molecular and human genetics. ''Some of these things, like breast cancer tissues that have taken years to develop,'' he said, ''now may well take 20 to 30 years to replace.'' ROSS E. MILLOY"
"Three people were killed here this weekend and more than 10,000 were forced to flee their homes by the tropical storm Allison, which has dumped up to 26 inches of rain in a little more than 24 hours. The storm, which has lingered over the Texas and Louisiana coasts for nearly a week, flooded area freeways, shuttered businesses and forced nine of Houston's largest hospitals to declare internal emergencies. President Bush declared Harris County and 27 other nearby counties disaster areas this afternoon, and by evening employees of the Federal Emergency Management Administration were on their way to the city. The declaration made residents eligible for low-rate relief loans, grants and other financial assistance. Emergency officials used boats, helicopters and high-water rescue vehicles today to evacuate thousands of residents trapped by rapidly rising floodwaters. Rob Wyman, a Coast Guard spokesman, said the agency's three local helicopter crews were concentrating on medical emergencies as a first priority for air evacuation, leaving many others stranded. ''There are more people out there on rooftops than we can possibly even count, much less help,'' Mr. Wyman said. The three deaths were reported tonight. One man drowned along a bayou and a woman drowned while trapped in a flooded elevator in the basement of the Bank of America building downtown. Another man died when his car was submerged in water under a bridge. Already saturated by days of heavy rains, dozens of creeks and bayous that snake through downtown Houston leaped their banks after Friday night's downpour and flowed into streets and nearby neighborhoods. The city's skyscrapers seemed themselves to be emerging from the sea, and pressure from rising floodwaters caused 20-foot geysers to spurt from the expansion cracks in freeway overpasses. By this evening, the water had receded in many parts of the city. But abandoned cars and trucks snarled traffic throughout the city, and dozens of intersections remained underwater as darkness fell. At the Texas Medical Center near the city center, nurses were reportedly hand-ventilating patients on respirators and using stairways to race between floors to deliver medicines after power failures shut down the elevators. And hospitals throughout the city were urging that nonemergency patients be taken to facilities in Austin or Dallas. ''We would plead of the Houston community that this combined resource be used only for life-threatening critical services that need an intensive care unit, need specialized facilities, or need an immediate operation,'' said Dr. Ken Mattox, chief of the trauma unit at the Ben Taub hospital. ''The storm has crippled every hospital in the Texas Medical Center.'' All major highways into the city had some flooding, and along the Katy Freeway on Houston's west side, 18-wheeled tractor-trailer rigs were reported swept from the roadway by rapidly rising water. The city's fire chief, Danny Smith, said, ''I've lived here all my life and I've never seen flooding like this.'' His department received over 2,500 emergency calls between 5 p.m. Friday and 11 a.m. today. ''They're all stranded motorists or people in residences calling to be evacuated,'' Chief Smith said. State disaster officials dispatched 26 high-water vehicles and 22 boats to the area, and surrounding communities raced to get additional rafts and boats into Houston to help with evacuations. In one neighborhood in southeast Houston, residents ferried pets and clothing to higher ground using swimming pool rafts. City officials hope some of the water will recede before the next deluge, but forecasters are predicting more rain for tonight and Sunday as Allison churns offshore in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. ''We really need a couple of days without rain to get any drainage,'' said Wes Johnson, a spokesman for the city's Department of Public Works and Engineering. Of particular concern, Mr. Johnson said, are residents who are wading in the water. Like the sewage systems in most cities, Houston's system has ventilation holes to prevent the buildup of potentially explosive methane gas. Floodwaters have flowed into the openings and carried raw sewage back out. ''We're trying to make people understand that they could get a serious infection if they are out there knee deep in the water,'' Mr. Johnson said. Meteorologists said the system appeared to be heading back to the gulf, where it might gather strength. In Louisiana, The Associated Press reported, dozens of alligators stirred up by the storm's thunder, lightning and heavy rain have been wandering into residential areas. Kathy Smith did not believe her daughter had really seen an alligator in their yard in LaPlace, La., until she saw a neighbor trying to catch one on Friday. ''I said, 'You get him, and I'm about to call 911,' '' she told the news service. In Houston, just driving home could be an adventure. G. J. Loh and his wife, Jennifer, left downtown shortly before midnight Friday for their home on the west side of Houston, a trip that normally takes 30 minutes. They arrived home about 6:30 this morning. ''We drove through water where it was extremely difficult to judge how high it was,'' Mr. Loh said. ''You almost didn't know until the car in front of you went through or you took your chances. Once you go there's no turning back.'' Corey Ray, a spokesman for Mayor Lee P. Brown, said 3,000 homes and businesses had been damaged so far by the storm and estimated that 10,000 people would need some type of housing because their homes had been affected by rising water. But officials believe those numbers could rise if Allison regains strength and continues to pound the Texas coast. ''We're in a 'wait and see' situation,'' Mr. Ray said."
"The soggy remnants of Tropical Storm Allison slowly pinwheeled across the Middle Atlantic states yesterday, flooding roads, topping off streams and testing patience in the New York metropolitan region before sweeping north and beginning a sluggish turn out to sea. Unlike the deadly mix of wind and water that claimed at least 43 lives since Allison touched ground on June 5 in the Gulf states, the rains that accompanied the weakening storm as it trekked across this region yesterday proved to be little more than an annoyance. In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- where as much as 5.5 inches of rain fell -- officials late yesterday reported numerous road closings caused by flash flooding but no serious injuries or property damage. Things were more severe, however, in Pennsylvania, which National Weather Service officials said was the hardest hit area in the Middle Atlantic after being soaked yesterday with more than 10 inches of rain in some parts. Four people were killed Saturday in Upper Moreland Township, Pa., about 16 miles north of Philadelphia, when a fire struck a flooded apartment complex. Firefighters, who had been hindered from battling the blaze by rising floodwaters, were still searching yesterday for two residents of the complex missing since the fire. Flash-flood warnings remained in effect in some parts of the New York region through midafternoon yesterday even as badly flooded parts of southern New Jersey and southeastern Pennsylvania began the process of drying out. Residents there began surveying flooded homes and submerged some vehicles. ''In some areas, this is probably the worst since Floyd,'' said Bob Stauber, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's office in Mount Holly, N.J., referring to the record flooding from Tropical Storm Floyd in 1999. Mr. Stauber said that effects of the storm varied widely throughout the region. ''Down here in Mount Holly, it was heavy but it didn't cause too much problems,'' Mr. Stauber said. ''But if you were under that 10 inches. . . .'' Weather service officials said the highest 24-hour rainfall numbers were recorded in Chalfont, Pa., which was soaked with more than 10 inches. ''Well, we're wet,'' one dispatcher with the Chalfont Police Department said. ''What else do you want to know?'' While the storm caused many evacuations in Pennsylvania, the authorities in the New York region late yesterday reported only limited evacuations, like at a Fairfield, N.J., hotel where guests were forced out because of concerns about standing water on the roof. The storm also led to some delays at Newark International Airport Saturday night, but scheduled flights were running smoothly yesterday, airport officials said. Although the storm knocked out power for about 50,000 people around Philadelphia, public utilities officials in the New York region reported no widespread disruptions. In one of the largest power failures around New York, Con Edison reported that about 1,300 customers in Mount Vernon were left without power for about an hour after a lightning strike early yesterday morning. Utility workers were still trying to restore power to some of the roughly 3,000 others who lost electricity throughout the region yesterday. ''Most of them are back,'' said Martha Liipfert, a Con Edison spokeswoman. ''We're still working on the others and, of course, we'll stay out there until everyone is restored.'' New Jersey Department of Transportation officials reported that scores of local roadways -- and parts of such major thoroughfares as Routes 35 and 36 -- flooded yesterday. However, as waters began to recede, virtually all of the major roads were passable last night. In Westchester County, parts of the Bronx River Parkway and the Saw Mill River Parkway were closed temporarily yesterday. ''We've had a lot of local flooding,'' said Lt. Michael Palumbo of the Westchester County police. Meteorologists with the National Weather Service said that the remains of the storm would continue to move northeast into New England and into the Atlantic Ocean possibly as early as this morning. They also warned that the wet weather might not be gone long: forecasts call for sunshine today and tomorrow but a chance of showers Wednesday night."
"As storm-weary residents emerged from their waterlogged homes here today, they faced highways littered with jackknifed 18-wheeled trucks, roads lined with abandoned cars, trash and tires and whole neighborhoods underwater. Tropical Storm Allison, which caught just about everyone off guard when it struck with renewed strength on Friday and early Saturday, hammered southeast Texas for nearly a week, leaving at least 15 people dead and about 10,000 homes and 5,000 buildings damaged. One person also died in Louisiana as a result of the storm. [Page A12.] With the threat of rain easing today in Texas, Gov. Rick Perry toured the area by helicopter with Mayor Lee P. Brown and officials from the Federal Emergency Management Administration. Mayor Brown has estimated that at least 5,000 buildings in Houston were damaged by water, with losses perhaps reaching $1 billion. In light of the storm's devastation, President Bush has declared Harris County and 27 other southeast Texas counties a federal disaster area, eligible for loans to local governments and individuals. ''We're still assessing just how much damage we've got, and it may be some time before we've got an accurate count,'' said Paul Bettencourt, the Harris County tax assessor who estimated that 10,000 homes had been damaged. ''Many areas are still flooded and we haven't been able to get into them yet.'' At the world's largest medical facility, the Texas Medical Center near downtown -- a complex of more than a dozen hospitals and research laboratories -- dozens of volunteers worked furiously today to unload crates of dry ice to cool laboratory specimens put at risk by power failures over the weekend. Claire Bassett, a vice president at the Baylor College of Medicine, said thousands of laboratory animals, mainly rats and mice, had been killed when storm waters flooded their facilities overnight Friday. ''We won't know just how bad the loss is until we can get in there, but we're estimating the losses of lab animals throughout the Texas Medical Center at several thousand,'' Ms. Bassett said. But worse, she said, was the loss of scientific research and specimens flooded or destroyed when the power failed. One of those most affected by the loss was Dr. Bonnie Dunbar, a professor of molecular and cellular biology at the college, who said she lost more than 20 years worth of laboratory specimens and clones. ''It's all gone, more than 20 years of work, and there are hundreds of other like me,'' Dr. Dunbar said. ''We've lost meticulous research, doctoral theses, experiment records, biological samples, all gone.'' Dr. Dunbar, who was to have left for Kenya on Monday as part of a Fulbright scholarship program to perform pediatric H.I.V. research in Africa, has also been displaced from her home: the rains knocked out power and telephones in her 40-story apartment building, and she has been forced to move. In the hard-hit northeastern part of the city, more than 3,300 people took refuge on Saturday night in the Lakewood Church, which eventually became the largest refugee center of more than 30 across the city. ''People just started coming and kept on coming because they had no place else to go,'' the church's pastor, the Rev. Joel Osteen, said. ''Eventually, city workers started dropping people off here in dump trucks because they were the only vehicles that could get through the water.'' Short of food by Saturday morning, Mr. Osteen recruited two brothers- in-law with Chevy Suburbans and a family friend for a visit to Sam's Discount Club, where they spent $3,000 on ingredients for sandwiches. ''Every time we returned with a load of food, the crowd of people would have gotten larger and we'd have to go make another trip,'' he said. But by today, the local news media had reported about food shortages at the church, and area residents bearing food, diapers, clothing and bottled water created a traffic jam in the streets outside the church. Signs of the flooding were apparent in the neighborhoods of the Lakewood area, with soaked carpets, furniture and clothing strewn in dozens of muddy yards. In addition to the staggering job of cleaning up after the flood, there was also the burden of mourning, as details of the deaths the city sustained over the weekend emerged. One couple, walking along the banks of White Oak Bayou, were swept away by a rapidly rising torrent, their bodies later found in the branches of nearby trees. A man trying to save a television set was electrocuted when he reached for its antenna; his mother also was electrocuted as she tried to help him. At least five drivers died after being caught by high water in their vehicles. But one of the most shocking accounts was the death of Kristie Lee Tautenhahn, 42, a clerk at a downtown law firm. Warned that vehicles in the Bank of America building's underground garage should be moved to higher ground, she took an elevator down to get her car from the fourth level of the garage early Saturday morning. At the third level, water flooded into the elevator, shutting off power, and Ms. Tautenhahn drowned there, alone. ''To die in an elevator is just tragic,'' John Tautenhahn, her cousin, told The Houston Chronicle. ''This is just devastating.'' Much of downtown remained crippled today, without power or working telephones. Parts of the dozen miles of tunnels beneath the city, built to help downtown office workers escape the summer heat and filled with food courts and stores, were flooded. At the Harris County Jail, which is adjacent to Buffalo Bayou, 3,000 inmates had to be moved to other facilities when the floods knocked out electricity and water. Continental Airlines, based in Houston, resumed flights today after canceling more than 1,000 flights on Saturday. And all across the city, as the sun finally poked through still-cloudy skies, residents shared stories of what they are calling the ''Great Flood of 2001.'' Jennifer Brazzel, an artist and interior designer, was stranded when she tried to drive her Toyota 4-Runner five miles to a friend's house on Friday night. Her car flooded just off Rice University's campus and a block from the Rice Village Shopping Center. ''I was trying to drive to my friend's house and all of a sudden Rice Boulevard was like a river,'' Ms. Brazzel said. ''Water was over my dash.'' Ms. Brazzel managed to get the car door open, and fought her way to higher ground, although the current knocked her down several times along the way. The sun had risen before she got home. Linda Gomez's husband was moving cars to higher ground when Ms. Gomez heard a noise in the backyard and saw water bursting from a manhole cover. When she went to investigate in the dark, she slipped into the hole. The water was only a foot deep but the lid was stuck and the current was strong. She was treated for bruises and scrapes at a hospital on Friday. ''When I got home the water was starting to rise,'' she said. She disconnected electrical appliances and began to move furniture higher, but by 10:30 that night the water had started coming into the house. ''By then it was too late,'' Ms. Gomez said. ''The water came into the house so fast. We were trying to get things up. There was no way to get out.'' As the water continued to rise in the one-story house, to an eventual height of almost five feet, they moved to the attic. ''Neighbors were screaming on both sides,'' Ms. Gomez said. ''The homeless men who sleep in the park across the street were screaming for help. I told my husband we have to figure out a way to make a hole in the roof.'' She eventually reached her son, who works with the Sheriff's Department, by cell phone. ''I told him I don't think we'll make it out of here,'' Ms. Gomez said. About 8 a.m. Saturday, a Houston Fire Department boat evacuated Ms. Gomez and her family. Today, they returned to find their home filled with mud and debris. As she surveyed the damage, Ms. Gomez said: ''I was raised in this house. I'm 54 years old. And I've never seen anything like this.''"
"Tropical Storm Barry, nearing wind speeds that almost made it the season's first hurricane, aimed toward the Gulf Coast of Florida and Alabama today, carrying the threat of torrential rains and weeks of flooding. This evening, the storm was spinning at about 70 miles per hour in the Gulf of Mexico, about 45 miles from the barrier-island town Fort Walton Beach, Fla. The National Hurricane Center said there was only a slight chance that it would reach hurricane speeds of 74 m.p.h. by landfall, expected before dawn on Monday. Hurricane center officials said the storm could drop 8 to 10 inches of rain on the panhandle, southern Alabama and Georgia. High waves and a storm surge of 4 to 5 feet above normal were also forecast for the Florida coast. Emergency management officials and coastal residents took moderate precautions, although several said they tended not to get too worried when an approaching storm failed to exceed 70 m.p.h. ''This isn't that big a deal yet,'' said Curtis Bosarge, who owns a vacation home in Gulf Shores, Ala. ''Of course, that could change at any minute, but I'm sticking it out.'' Michael Hardin, chief of the emergency management division of Escambia County, Fla., which includes Pensacola, said the county had not ordered any evacuations of coastal areas but had opened three shelters farther inland. Only a few people were in the shelters this evening, Mr. Hardin said. He said coastal authorities were as worried about the heavy rain bands visible in radar snapshots of the storm as they were about high winds. Forecasters said the storm could stall over southern Alabama or Georgia and produce heavy rains for two or three days, Mr. Hardin said, which would probably produce flooding along the coast for a week or so. Bill Frederick, a meteorologist with the hurricane center, said Barry was unlikely to exceed 70 m.p.h. and would probably drop to 30 to 50 m.p.h. by the time it crossed the coast. The rain will probably become the storm's biggest threat, he said, and not just along the coast. The remnants of the storm could also cause flooding as far north as Arkansas in the next two weeks. A weather system in the central plains will keep the storm from moving north and dissipating, forcing it to spend enough time raining on the south-central Mississippi Valley to produce what the center called a ''serious inland flooding event.'' The last hurricane in the area was Georges in 1998, which left behind 18 inches of rain in the Pensacola area and causing serious flooding. Farther east, near Panama City, Fla., the authorities in Franklin County ordered the evacuation of several thousand residents on three barrier islands. ''Even if it doesn't become a hurricane, we can lose parts of the causeway and the roads that we need to evacuate these islands,'' said Tim Turner, emergency management director for Franklin County. ''Once we get to 40 m.p.h., we have to close the bridges, because they're unsafe to drive on. So we thought it would be better to get people out of there. It's always a judgment call.'' Mr. Turner added that one tornado had touched down in the area and that the rainfall could become quite serious. After taking its unexpected turn eastward, the storm spared New Orleans and much of the Mississippi coast. This afternoon was mostly bright and windy around Mobile. But beaches were closed because of strong riptides caused by the storm, and there were reports of waves as high as eight feet. Several regional airports also planned to shut down tonight, and the Air Force flew about 300 of its personnel from Fort Walton Beach to Little Rock, Ark., on 40 cargo aircraft to move them from the storm's path. Tropical Storm Barry is the second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. In June, Tropical Storm Allison dumped 20 inches of rain in Louisiana and 32 inches in Texas, much of it as the storm sat for days off the coast, then causing floods as far north as Pennsylvania."
"Having threatened Florida with high winds for three days, Tropical Storm Barry proved to be little more than a heavy downpour as it crossed the Panhandle this morning, soaking large parts of the Southeast but doing little damage. Forecasters warned, however, that the storm -- now downgraded to a tropical depression -- still had the potential to inflict serious flooding if it stalled over Arkansas or Mississippi later in the week and continued its rainfall. ''Right now, it looks like things will be O.K. as long as it keeps moving pretty quickly,'' said James Franklin, a hurricane specialist in the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ''But if it slows down in the next day or so, the threat of flooding will increase.'' At its peak on Sunday, the storm almost became the season's first hurricane, reaching sustained winds of 70 miles per hour, just short of the hurricane level of 74 m.p.h. But as a sign of its diminished status in the world of weather, the hurricane center handed it off to its sister agency, the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center near Washington, which deals with more mundane events like thunderstorms and blizzards. The hurricane specialists wanted nothing more to do with the storm after its winds dropped to an embarrassing 30 m.p.h. ''That's H.P.C.'s storm now,'' Mr. Franklin said. Florida residents seemed similarly unimpressed by the storm's bluster. Only a few people had boarded up windows or used an emergency shelter on Sunday night. Though the storm came ashore just east of Destin, Fla., shortly after midnight, that resort town and the nearby barrier-island strip of Fort Walton Beach showed little sign of damage beyond fallen tree limbs and power lines. A few garbage cans were sent reeling, and there was an occasional shower of palm fronds. ''We've had worse storms than this in St. Louis,'' said Shirley Boedeker of Florissant, Mo., who was spending the week in Fort Walton Beach with her husband and grandchildren. Ann Rowe, a spokeswoman for the Florida Division of Emergency Management, said that about 37,000 people lost power in six Panhandle counties, but that there were no reports of injuries. One home was lost in Cape San Blas, and a high-rise condominium building in Destin lost some windows. The agency said the greatest rainfall of the day was some distance away in Tallahassee, where 440 roads were closed and flash flooding was widespread. By midday, the storm, greatly weakened, was over Selma, Ala., and was expected to spend the night in Mississippi, pleasing farmers in the area."
"They are the front line of New York City's vast upstate water system, responsible for delivering the one billion gallons a day of fresh, clean water that keeps the city alive. But since 2001, these 873 inspectors, engineers and supervisors, along with their employer, the City Department of Environmental Protection, have been under court-ordered supervision for violating, of all things, environmental laws. The department has had five years to retrain its water supply employees and change old habits. Citing improvements by the agency, a federal judge decided last week to end court supervision over the watershed in August. The ruling was a relief for the department, but it upset local officials and upstate residents who say the department cannot be trusted, especially after a recent spate of incidents revealed continuing problems in the watershed. Some of the incidents involved criminal activities, like theft; others appeared to stem from brazen negligence, like an inspector's repeated photocopying of the same weekly report on dam safety. But taken together, the problems have heightened tensions in the 2,000-square-mile watershed. They have also worked to raise concerns that if relations between the city and the upstate communities deteriorate further, local officials may stop cooperating with the city, potentially costing New York billions of dollars. ''The D.E.P. has a culture of malfeasance and arrogance that's pervasive,'' said State Senator John J. Bonacic, a Republican whose district in Sullivan, Ulster and Delaware Counties includes six of the city's largest reservoirs. Mr. Bonacic said he thought it might be too soon to end court oversight. He wants to keep the pressure on the department to clean up its act and become more responsive. It if does not, Mr. Bonacic said, he will urge the federal Environmental Protection Agency not to renew a crucial permit next year. Without that permit, the city could be forced to build a water filtration plant costing more than $8 billion. Emily Lloyd, commissioner of the environmental department, said she was aware that upstate communities have concerns about the recent incidents and are worried about flooding. It is natural, she said, for such issues to surface during the process of renewing the filtration avoidance permit. ''It's their chance to get us to pay more attention to things they want us to respond to,'' Ms. Lloyd said. High on the list of concerns is the way the department takes care of its 22 dams, especially the one located where the city's water supply is farthest from the city. Some people who live in Schoharie County -- much closer to the State House in Albany than to City Hall in Manhattan -- panicked last November when they were told that the 78-year-old Gilboa Dam on the Schoharie Reservoir no longer meets state safety standards and needs emergency repairs. When frightened local residents pressed city officials, they discovered that because of neglected maintenance, valves that might have been used to lower the reservoir's water level were buried under 15 feet of silt and could not be opened. Then, last month, a newspaper, The Times Herald-Record of Middletown, found that 70 percent of the weekly inspection reports for dams on two reservoirs in Sullivan County -- the Neversink and the Roundout -- were actually photocopies of earlier reports, with only the date and the weather conditions changed. City officials said the inspector in question had already been ordered to stop using photocopies. They asserted that the dams were safe and that the weekly reports were for internal use only. But that was little comfort to critics. ''Dam safety is like riding in a Brink's truck -- you can never let your guard down,'' said Howard R. Bartholomew, a resident of Middleburgh, in Schoharie County, who has been active in organizing local efforts to monitor the Gilboa Dam. Mr. Bartholomew said he was distressed to learn that court supervision of the department's upstate operations would end soon. ''I hate to see the judge reduce the pressure on them,'' Mr. Bartholomew said. Department officials concede that it is difficult to supervise employees who work as far as 125 miles from the city. ''There's no getting around the fact that this was a very different culture,'' Ms. Lloyd said in an interview. ''But it's not just culture. It's also history and habit.'' In part, she said, what occurs now is the legacy of the department's predecessor, an autonomous agency created in 1905 -- long before the advent of environmental laws -- to build the upstate reservoirs and pipelines. Conveying clean water to New York City was the priority, not complying with detailed federal regulations. Although there have been improvements, the commissioner conceded that there was still work to be done to improve management of the watershed and the rest of the department. Last September, the department's director of watershed programs, James D. Benson, was arrested, along with one of his associates, Lamberto S. Santos, and charged with possessing about $10,000 in city property, including generators, snowblowers and computers. And last November, a former city employee, Dieter Greenfeld, was sentenced to two years' probation after he pleaded guilty to falsifying water quality records at what is known as the Catskill Lower Effluent Chamber in Westchester County when he worked there. If that sort of thing could take place while the department was on probation, local officials wonder, what will happen when court supervision ends as scheduled in August? When Judge Charles L. Brieant of the United States District Court in White Plains decided to end the watershed supervision, he did not terminate the court's oversight entirely. Rather, he shifted it to the city, and the workers who operate 14 huge wastewater treatment plants. In court last week, Ms. Lloyd acknowledged that workers had failed to repair backup generators at two wastewater treatment plants, causing millions of gallons of raw sewage to pour into New York waterways during the blackout of 2003. The violations at the sewage plants, Anne C. Ryan, an assistant United States attorney, wrote in a report to the federal court, reflected ''a mindset that persists in some components of D.E.P., namely, a failure to grasp that compliance is everyone's job.'' ''They suggest, at a minimum, that there is more work to be done to educate all D.E.P. employees about the requirements of environmental laws and the importance of complying with them,'' she wrote."
"EVEN before last April's disastrous floods, the Meyers Grove neighborhood along the Neversink River wasn't exactly Malibu, just an unpretentious jumble of modest houses, trailers and bungalows, many of them converted from summer vacation cottages. But 10 months after the river roared over its banks, cresting at 11 feet over flood stage, it still looks like parts of New Orleans, with some houses repaired and rebuilt, some vacant and condemned, and others reduced to doleful piles of rubble, waiting to be hauled away. Last year's flooding on the Delaware River and some of its tributaries, including the Neversink, may be a fleeting memory downstate, but for residents in Meyers Grove, along Rivers Edge Road down the road in nearby Huguenot and in dozens of other riverside towns and hamlets, it's no more past than Katrina is for residents of the Gulf Coast. So, if Mark D. House, the supervisor of the Town of Deerpark in Orange County, whose 9,000 residents include the people of Meyers Grove, sounds a little hyperbolic as he talks about reservoir levels and spillway management, it's not just him. This is one subject where the upstate/downstate divide is now more divided than ever. ''It's like they're holding a gun to my head, it's loaded, they have their finger on the trigger, and they're squeezing the trigger,'' he said, navigating his way around the neighborhood in his PT Cruiser. ''And they have the gall to say, oh, by the way, if this should go off, it's not our fault and it's not our responsibility.'' The gun, if you want to call it that, is the water in the Neversink Reservoir, now over 100 percent of capacity at a time that it's usually around 80. When kept at a lower level, the reservoir, which is part of New York City's water supply system, can help prevent or limit flooding, by giving water from swollen rivers a place to collect rather than cascading downstream. But keeping such reservoirs as full as possible maximizes the city's ability to provide water downstate even in an extended dry spell. The city's Department of Environmental Protection has always said that it's in the water delivery business, not the flood control business, and that, in fact, its reservoirs in the Catskill and Delaware systems have limited abilities to release water and manage flooding. But after two severe floods almost back to back, first in September 2004, then in April 2005, that policy now comes across as imperial arrogance to flooded residents and communities. So up and down the rivers, people are hiring lawyers, forming organizations, gearing up for something other than business as it's usually been conducted. In a letter to New York's two United States senators and local representatives, State Senator John J. Bonacic, whose district encompasses much of the city's watershed, said last week it was outrageous that a year after the flooding, reservoir levels were still at 100 percent capacity, in advance of expected spring rains and snowmelt. He is calling on officials to lobby against a federal designation the city needs to avoid building a $10 billion filtration system unless the city satisfactorily addresses dam safety and flood control issues. ''The D.E.P.'s position is arrogant,'' he wrote. ''It is the most arrogant position by any agency that I have seen in all my years of holding public office.'' FOR its part, the environmental agency says it has already altered its policies, consistent with its legal obligations, particularly with the Delaware River Basin Commission, where New York State and its neighbors New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware must approve changes in water releases. The agency says it has already begun a program of releases of water based on anticipated snowmelt and has proposed a more ambitious one that would allow releases that would be equal to the water from a one-inch rainfall over a six-hour period. ''I think it's a start, and it's a show of good faith,'' said Michael Principe, deputy commissioner of the D.E.P. ''We can never reduce 100 percent of the risk, but this is a way of mitigating some of the risk, which is the best we can expect.'' In truth, there's a lot more at issue than the D.E.P.'s flood control measures on reservoirs and dams built with limited flood control technology. Rivers do flood. Blame nature. People do live in flood-prone areas. Meyers Grove is one of them. Still, it's clear that the recent flooding has, for now at least, changed the balance between the people upstate who live beneath the dams and people downstate who just want to know that water will come out when they open the tap. Like it or not, the city has a toe in the flood control business, after all. For now, the reservoirs are full. The rainy season is around the corner. So people watch the weather, they watch the rivers, they wait, and they worry. Our Towns Email: Peappl@nytimes.com"
"One person was killed and as many as seven were missing on Tuesday morning after an earthen dam burst on the North Shore of Kauai, sending a wall of water from the mountains toward the ocean, ripping up a highway and lifting several houses off their foundations. State Representative Hermina M. Morita said the body of a man was found after the dam, which held back the Kaloko Reservoir, burst in the early morning. Ms. Morita, a Democrat whose district includes the dam, near Kilauea, said the victims were asleep in their homes when the dam burst. It was about 40 feet high and 800 feet along and captured runoff from several small streams. The water raced down a stream, ripping up asphalt and closing Kuhio Highway. ''It took two houses completely off their foundations, leaving just the concrete slabs,'' said Dave Curtis, a spokesman for the Hawaii Department of Civil Defense. Kuhio Highway, the only road to two North Shore communities, Princeville and Hanalei, will remain closed until state transportation officials can inspect the stability of a second dam downstream from the reservoir. Ray Lovell, a spokesman for the State Department of Civil Defense, said: ''It's a small island, and this is a pretty big disaster.'' The Coast Guard used a C-130 plane and two H-65 helicopters to search about 9,200 square miles of coastline and ocean for the missing people, said Chief Petty Officer Marsha Delaney. Kauai and the other Hawaiian Islands to the south have had heavy rain and flooding for several weeks."
"The endless tug-of-war between New York City, with its unquenchable thirst for clean water, and residents of the city's upstate watershed, who fear they will be flooded whenever reservoirs overflow, gets played out daily in Angela and David Walker's home here. Mr. Walker is an operating engineer who works under the streets of Manhattan, digging New York's third water tunnel. His father helped build the nearby Pepacton Reservoir dam 50 years ago. They know as well as anyone that the city relies for its very life on the one billion gallons of water a day it draws from 19 upstate reservoirs. The Walkers' home, a woodsy cabin just downstream from the mammoth Pepacton Reservoir, has been flooded at least five times in the last few years, and now they, like many others in this rural corner of Delaware County more than 120 miles from New York, blame the city for holding so much water in its reservoirs that a big rain or snowmelt can cause devastating floods. ''I'm not comfortable living here anymore,'' said Mrs. Walker, 47, an aide in the local public school. Every time she hears it is going to rain, she makes sure her picnic table is chained to a tree and her oil tank is firmly anchored to the ground so they won't wash away. ''To keep that reservoir at the level they keep it at,'' she grumbled, ''is ridiculous.'' The city is beginning to listen. Slowly, against its will, New York is taking steps to prevent floods from ravaging the watershed, even if it means endangering its water level. Last week, the city announced a new initiative to empty billions of gallons out of the Pepacton and Neversink Reservoirs to create space so that, if it rains, the threat to residents will be reduced. That is in addition to another plan to release water from the reservoir in an amount equivalent to half the snowpack on adjacent mountainsides. Just this week, Daniel L. Doctoroff, deputy mayor for economic development, traveled the 130 miles to the farthest of the city's upstate reservoirs to announce that the city would install flood gates and release valves in the 80-year-old Gilboa Dam to control future floods at the Schoharie Reservoir. The changes are a significant shift for the city, which for decades has maintained that it is not in the flood control business, that its primary obligation is to provide water to nine million people in the metropolitan area, and that doing so requires keeping the reservoirs full. ''It's a delicate balancing act,'' Mr. Doctoroff said. ''Everybody won't get everything they want. We'll all have to compromise. That's the nature of being a good neighbor.'' To be sure, the Bloomberg administration is not planning to release so much water that the city goes dry. No official wants to have to announce water restrictions in a summer after reservoirs were deliberately lowered in the spring. But predicting rainfall months in advance is not an exact science, and miscalculations occur despite advances in forecasting, officials acknowledge. Take, for instance, the four huge steel siphons the city installed early this year at the Gilboa Dam, which needs emergency repairs. The siphons cost $3 million to install, but since construction was completed a few weeks ago, they have hardly been used because the level of the reservoir is already too low for them to function. Officials expressed confidence that they had become much better at balancing supply and demand, but that is apparently not the only reason for the city's willingness to accept some responsibility for flood control. A clear change in weather patterns has brought more intensive storms to the state. Major flooding occurs far more frequently and has become more difficult for the city to ignore. The city has also been under increasing criticism for the way it runs its water system. Falsified dam inspection reports and the deteriorated condition of the Gilboa Dam, which needs major repairs, pushed the State Senate to pass a number of bills holding the city more accountable for the way it manages its water system. One measure, sponsored by Senator John J. Bonacic, a Republican, and supported by several senators from the city, would allow the state to set water levels in the reservoirs to avoid flooding. Emily Lloyd, commissioner of the City Department of Environmental Protection, which runs the water system, stated at a recent public meeting that the reservoirs simply did not have the equipment needed to undertake flood control. She also said releasing water in anticipation of a storm ''defeats the very purpose for which the reservoirs were created,'' providing safe, clean water for New York. And yet, a few weeks later, the city agreed to do just that. Mr. Doctoroff said that while the Senate's actions were not a factor in revising the flood policy, ''it never hurts to be reminded.'' But State Senator James L. Seward, a Republican who represents watershed communities, said there was ''no question'' that the city had bowed to the pressure to accept responsibility for flood control. Under the new rain plan announced earlier this month, the city will lower the water level at the Pepacton and Neversink Reservoirs enough so that each can completely contain the runoff from a storm that leaves an inch of rain in six hours. The program will run through March 31 at both reservoirs. The city is under constant pressure from many different sources with competing and sometimes conflicting claims on the water supply. Upstate residents want the city to release water to prevent flooding. Trout fishermen on the Delaware River expect the city to release cold water in the summer to cool off the trout. And a 1954 United States Supreme Court decision requires the city to share the waters of the Delaware River, which feeds the Pepacton and other reservoirs, with Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. ''We do what we can to mitigate flooding within the constraints we operate under,'' said Michael A. Principe, director of the city's bureau of water supply, ''but people have to remember that storms cause flooding, not reservoirs.'' Late yesterday, Mr. Principe announced that he planned to retire next month, a move officials said was unrelated to the recent policy changes. If city officials hoped that initiating the new flood control measures would calm the fears of watershed residents, they may be disappointed. Robert A. Homovich, supervisor of the Town of Colchester, which includes Downsville and other small hamlets below the Pepacton Dam, lives with his wife, Shirley, as close to the dam as anyone. Their four-square white colonial, less than half a mile from the reservoir, was originally an office used by the construction crews that built the dam in the late 40's and early 50's. Last April, shortly after the snowpack melt program ended, Mr. Homovich's basement was flooded from floor to ceiling. A smaller house on the back of the property, near the river, was nearly washed away when the flood waters rose so high they lapped against a nearby covered bridge dating to 1854. Now the Homoviches have joined other residents in a class action lawsuit accusing the city of mismanaging its reservoir. ''Around here we judge people on what they do and not on what they say,'' Mr. Homovich said. ''Their track record of not doing what they say they're going to do makes me suspicious of anything they say.''"
"A winter rainstorm caused severe flooding across Northern California on Saturday, setting off mudslides, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of people and closing roads and freeways here and in Nevada. The flooding, the worst in California's wine country in two decades, turned hundreds of dormant vineyards into small lakes and threatened to inundate tens of thousands of acres of farmland in Sonoma and Napa counties. Some stranded people had to be evacuated by helicopter. Scattered power failures were reported. In Napa, southeast of here, weather forecasters said flooding from the Napa River had reached record stages in St. Helena, where 230 residents in one community were temporarily evacuated to a high school. Hundreds of others across the two counties were evacuated throughout the day Saturday, through voluntary and mandatory evacuations, as county officials warned that two major waterways, the Napa and the Russian rivers, were cresting to dangerously high levels, well above flood benchmarks. ''We are strongly urging people to evacuate the area,'' said Steven Sharp, a spokesman for the Sonoma County Office of Emergency Services. Some of the roads in towns along the basin of the Russian river had already become impassable by Saturday afternoon, and residents were advised to leave before dark. ''If they want to try and get out of there,'' Mr. Sharp said, ''now is the time to get out of there.'' No serious injuries or deaths were reported in the region by Saturday afternoon. More rain was forecast for Sunday afternoon from a new storm, although not as much for this area as officials had feared. The storm is now expected to drench parts of the state to the south. Here in Sonoma, Mr. Sharp said, the Russian River was expected to crest at about 45 feet tonight, surpassing its flood stage of 32 feet and making disastrous flooding possible on Sunday. ''It's a mess,'' said Ajayi Johnson, 28, of Santa Rosa, southeast of here, as he surveyed the damage to his mother's home, which was crushed when a mudslide plunged a large tree into it. His mother, Lloydie Terry, 55, was trapped in her home for two hours late Friday and then hospitalized with a broken leg, Mr. Johnson said. He said the house was ''missing two rooms and a bathroom and the kitchen.'' ''Everything is pushed to the front of the house,'' he said. ''I can only look inside the door, and I can see the kitchen door in the dining room.'' Since last weekend, Northern California has received an unusually large amount of rain. The Napa and Russian Rivers, weather forecasters said, were already at their highest levels in seven years before the latest storm began on Friday afternoon. In Petaluma, volunteers said about 90 people had come for help to the Luchessi Community Center, one of three Red Cross shelters opened in the county. Most of them were elderly, and many, they said, would spend New Year's Eve there. Mary Ruppenthal, 58, said she was asleep early Saturday morning at the Youngstown Mobile Park in Petaluma when she heard her neighbors yelling outside. When she went to look out the window, she said, she saw that her trailer was in four feet of water and that her back steps had floated away. Her car, she said, was completely under water. Ms. Ruppenthal was whisked away, in her pajamas and slippers, by fire officials rescuing people in dinghies and ferrying them through the watery streets. She had no time to take her white poodle, Casey, she said, although rescue officials got the dog later in the day and brought him to the shelter. ''I'm waiting to hear if it's safe to go back,'' she said. ''I don't know how badly we've been hit.'' Officials said it was too soon to assess the extent or cost of the damage from the flooding, but the last flood this serious, in 1986, destroyed scores of homes and businesses. Dave Whitmer, the Napa County agricultural commissioner, said it was fortunate that the region was not in the midst of the grape growing season. Wineries are a major source of revenue for Sonoma and Napa counties. Most of the grapevines in Napa's 45,000 acres of vineyards, Mr. Whitmer said, had already lost their leaves or are losing them now, and the vines can withstand some standing water. But he said severe flooding could almost ''mow down'' the vines if it was powerful enough to carry large debris. It can take several years before replanted vines grow enough to produce a crop. Sonoma has even more vineyards. ''When there's this much water,'' Mr. Whitmer said, ''it takes a while for anybody to even be able to go back to the areas to see what has happened.''"
"Finley Williford, the captain of a repair ship working in the Gulf of Mexico, is making plans to rebuild his Mississippi coast home, which was destroyed by the high winds and flooding of Hurricane Katrina. Most of the money is going to come from a federal flood insurance program that was begun nearly 40 years ago. He already has a check for $93,500. ''I haven't heard too many good stories about insurance,'' Mr. Williford said, ''but it seems like flood is paying off.'' For Mr. Williford, it certainly is. But the flood insurance program itself is in trouble. It has been run deeply into the red by about $23 billion in claims from policyholders like Mr. Williford even as it has failed to help most victims of the hurricane. Officials have turned to Congress for a bailout that the government program will never be able to pay even as it faces mounting calls to be drastically overhauled or even eliminated. ''The flood insurance program is broken,'' said Senator Richard C. Shelby, an Alabama Republican who heads the Banking Committee, which has oversight over the program. ''We've got to make major changes.'' Modifying the program is not enough for Representative Wayne T. Gilchrest, a Maryland Republican whose district spans the state's Eastern Shore from the Atlantic Ocean to the Chesapeake Bay. Mr. Gilchrest, the chairman of the House subcommittee on fisheries, conservation, wildlife and oceans, says the flood insurance program encourages people to put themselves in harm's way by building on the water's edge, in the expectation that the federal government will bail them out. ''We need to eliminate incentives for people to move in to flood-prone areas, whether it's on the banks of the Mississippi River or the coast of Maryland or wherever,'' he said. He called the program ''a huge burden that is only going to get worse.'' In the program's defense, David I. Maurstad, the acting director of the flood insurance program, agreed that the government needed to make changes, but argued that talk of ending national flood insurance was an over-reaction. Katrina was ''the greatest natural disaster in the history of this country,'' he said. ''It would not be fair to evaluate the effectiveness of this program on just the past three months.'' ''Does the program provide a benefit that the federal government ought to provide to the country?'' he asked. ''I come down on the side of a very definite yes.'' The flood insurance program was created in 1968 to solve several problems in a single stroke. The government agreed to offer coverage that private insurers refused to sell, thus helping people recover from floods. Insurance premiums went into a pool to cover losses that otherwise might be paid by taxes from across the country. With an eye toward lowering relief costs over the long run, the government, in exchange for the insurance, moved to require waterfront communities to adopt building codes to make homes less vulnerable to flooding. The government also created flood plain maps, now being revised in the wake of the storm, to show degrees of danger. But the program has not worked as planned. It was supposed to be self-supporting, but for the first 16 years, Congress paid its bills. Now, as it confronts the nation's worst flooding, the program, which is administered by the troubled Federal Emergency Management Agency, finds itself with too few customers and too small a pool of money to pay its obligations. To get people to sign up, the government offered the insurance at below-market prices. But most of those who stood to benefit shrugged at the potential risk anyway. ''People say, 'It's not going to happen to me; I'll never need flood insurance,' '' said Robert Rusboldt, chief executive of the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America, a trade group with members that sell flood policies. When Katrina struck, about 4.6 million homes and some businesses around the country were covered, fewer than half of the properties in danger of flooding, officials estimate. Those who bought the coverage were those most likely to be flooded -- which is why private insurers wanted no part of the business. Some people turned down flood insurance in the belief that the government would take care of them in a disaster, insurance experts say. In December, Congress seemed to buttress that belief by voting to give some homeowners without flood coverage up to $150,000 to rebuild. But most coastal residents will not qualify for those grants. Instead, families with poor credit ratings -- often those with low incomes -- are eligible for up to $27,100 in federal assistance. Those who demonstrate an ability to repay a loan may borrow up to $200,000 to repair or rebuild a home at an annual interest rate of 2.6 percent. The gap in coverage is huge. Federal officials say they have received 227,550 claims from flood insurance policyholders in Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Florida and Alabama and do not expect many more. But the Louisiana Recovery Authority reported in December that nearly 500,000 homes were destroyed or damaged in Louisiana and Mississippi alone. The federal program has paid out $11.1 billion to victims of the hurricane flooding. Nearly everyone had home insurance and the private insurers say they expect to pay about $40 billion in claims from Hurricane Katrina alone -- the most they have ever paid in a single hurricane. They insist that their home insurance policies, which account for about $17 billion in losses, rule out flood coverage. But with so many people without money to rebuild, the attorney general of Mississippi and several private lawyers are contending in lawsuits that the policies contain ambiguities that should be resolved in favor of homeowners. The flood insurance program has succeeded in getting most waterfront communities to agree to its building codes and it estimates that the safer standards save the country $1.1 billion in flood damage annually. But consumer advocates and environmental experts say that enforcement is not uniform and that the existence of the insurance has contributed to an explosion of risky coastal development. Even some supporters of the program link flood insurance and coastal building. ''If it's not available, if you can't cover your million-dollar house on a sand dune, you don't build your million-dollar house,'' said Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman for the American Insurance Association, a trade group in Washington. For Mr. Maurstad, the flood insurance acting director, coastal development is as inevitable as the tides. Coastal areas ''catch people's fancy,'' he said. ''Those areas are going to be developed,'' with or without federal insurance. With weather experts predicting more frequent and stronger coastal storms, Congress is expected to focus soon on trying to reshape the flood program. Senator Shelby and others are proposing to expand the program's reach to include millions more property owners, making the purchase of flood insurance mandatory for everyone in prescribed danger zones and sharply raising prices. ''The taxpayer shouldn't, in my opinion, subsidize everything, especially vacation homes, at below-market rates,'' Senator Shelby said. Flood insurance is now required for anyone getting a mortgage from a federal agency or a federally regulated lender and living in certain designated flood-prone areas. That is why Mr. Williford bought his policy. ''It cost me $300,'' he said, for $187,000 in insurance on his three-bedroom home in Bay St. Louis and $15,000 on the contents. The government offers a maximum of $250,000 in coverage for an average annual premium of $486, almost 40 percent less than the average cost of $250,000 in standard home insurance. Mr. Williford paid more than $1,300 a year for his homeowner policy. His insurance company is arguing that all his damage came from flooding and is refusing to pay him anything for wind damage. ''I had pine trees snapped off 50 feet in the air and laying on top of my house,'' he said. ''Water didn't do that.'' A keystone of the flood program was the creation of maps that delineated danger zones. The maps were supposed to be updated at least every three to five years. But many of the Gulf Coast maps were 10 to 20 years out of date when Hurricane Katrina hit. During that time, new roads, parking lots, homes and businesses had transformed the landscape, causing floodwaters to rise higher and extend much further inland than indicated on the maps. ''The flood plain is like a bathtub,'' said J. Robert Hunter, the director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of America and one of the early chiefs of the federal flood insurance program. ''You put a bunch of buildings in the flood plain and the water level goes up. It's just like somebody sitting down in a bathtub.'' Because the maps were integral to setting premiums, the coverage was further underpriced. Draft legislation being considered by Congress calls for spending $2.6 billion over the next six years to update flood maps, but any changes are bound to stir a political hornet's nest. ''A lot of areas that flooded this year were not supposed to flood,'' Mr. Shelby said. ''They weren't in designated areas. A lot of people who have not bought flood insurance realize now that they need it and needed it all along.'' By last year, the flood insurance program had paid policyholders $15 billion in claims, some of which would otherwise have come out of tax money. But over all, the flood insurance program has been paying a relatively small proportion of the nation's costs for flood recovery. In two of the most costly disaster years, the gap was especially wide. In 1994, the insurance program paid out $411 million, compared with an estimated outlay of $6.59 billion for other flood disaster relief, much of it to restore roads, bridges and public buildings. In 2001, the insurance program paid $1.27 billion while the government paid another estimated $8.97 billion for flood damage. FEMA is so far expecting to spend about $66 billion for disaster relief related to Katrina and the other hurricanes last year, most of it for flood damage. The flood program has swung in and out of debt over the last two decades. But it had paid back its borrowing with interest and was running a surplus until four hurricanes hit Florida in 2004. Unlike most insurance operations, the federal flood program does not charge enough to create a reserve or cushion to pay for periodic catastrophes. To develop an adequate reserve, some experts say, might require doubling or tripling rates. That would be politically difficult at best. Without a reserve, however, the program threatens to remain a huge, undefined national liability and to erupt into a drain on taxpayers at any moment. ''Part of running an insurance company,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist of the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York, ''is knowing you're going to have exceptional years and building up a reserve to handle that.''"
"Like many Californians, Jeffrey Mount, a geologist, has done a lot of thinking about water. He grew up in Los Angeles and remembers trying to save neighbors' homes with sandbags during winter floods in 1969. As a young professor at the University of California, Davis, he watched a severe 1986 storm inundate Yuba City and Marysville. ''The surface of the earth is shaped by flood events,'' Dr. Mount, 51, said in an interview at this year's meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in St. Louis. ''However, it's mighty inconvenient when that water comes rushing through your backyard.'' Avoidance of such calamities has been a central focus for Dr. Mount. In 1995, the University of the California Press published a textbook highly critical of river management practices in his state. Five years later, Dr. Mount became a maverick member of California State Reclamation Board, which oversees parts of the state levee system. Last fall, after Dr. Mount publicly suggested that the city of Sacramento might be vulnerable to a Hurricane Katrina-like disaster, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger dismissed all the board members, Dr. Mount said. None had been appointed by him. Appointments ''are at the pleasure of the governor,'' said Sabrina Demayo Lockhart, deputy press secretary for the governor, adding that he had named ''a wide variety of individuals who have extensive knowledge about California's water management.'' Q. If you were making a bet, where would you say the next New Orleans will be? A. I'd say the Sacramento area. The common denominator is concentrated urban development in the shadow of flooding and levees. You have around 400,000 people at risk from flooding, and the number will grow in the next few years because of intense development. The city's main problem is that it is situated between the American and the Sacramento Rivers and at the base of the 12,000 foot Sierra Nevada range. Both rivers are prone to flooding. Additionally, powerful storms come in from the Pacific, slam against the mountains and dump heavy precipitation that ends up very quickly in the rivers. Yet, around Sacramento -- the capital of the seventh largest economy in the world -- there's intense building on the flood plains. Twenty miles downstream is the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, a maze of leveed islands and channels that flow into San Francisco Bay. Because of past agricultural practices, the delta is sinking. Parts are 20 feet below sea level, lower than anything in New Orleans. Still, there are proposals to put up 130,000 new homes in the delta. Q. Why is there so much development in risky places? A. Because the new gold rush in California is real estate. Moreover, local governments are often reluctant to exert controls over developers because of the tax revolution. Do you remember Proposition 13 in 1978, which limited increases in property taxes on existing homes? It decimated the ability of localities to fund services. So money for basic services that people expect is now raised through growth. Many municipalities have become very aggressive about development. I heard a Northern California county supervisor say that his county needed development on its flood plain to fund flood control projects. Q. New Orleans was inundated after its levee system was breached by floodwaters. How strong are the levees around Sacramento? A. They offer a very low level of flood protection, probably the lowest for any major metropolitan area in the country. That assessment comes from the Army Corps of Engineers. The New Orleans levees were rated as having a 200-year level of flood protection. That's a 1 in 200 chance that the levees will be overwhelmed in a given year. Sacramento's levees are rated at less than half of that. Q. You are a geologist by trade. How did you get appointed to the California State Reclamation Board? A. About 10 years ago, I wrote a textbook, ''California Rivers and Streams.'' In it, I discussed some of the unwise ways we try to manage our rivers in my home state. I think the book may have been part of why, in 2001, Gray Davis appointed me to the board. It oversees flood control for roughly half the state. Once there, I questioned the wisdom of putting so much new housing behind levees and onto flood plains. My colleagues and I did something that Reclamation Board members hadn't before done: we asked to see environmental impact statements for some of these developments. We said, ''If you're going to build all these houses in flood-prone areas, show us your flood protection plans.'' I was especially concerned about planned housing developments in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta because a large part of California's water supply flows through it. If you had a disaster there, the drinking water of 23 million Californians would be at risk. No one in the governor's office -- not Davis or Schwarzenegger -- ever told us to shut up. But after a while you heard local officials and developers grumbling that our board was antigrowth. Q. Are you still a member of this Reclamation Board? A. Nope. We got terminated by the Terminator, all six board members. After Hurricane Katrina, I got media calls, asking, ''Could this happen here?'' I answered, ''We have much in common with New Orleans -- except Sacramento has less than half the level of flood protection that New Orleans supposedly had.'' Q. Weren't you appointed by Governor Schwarzenegger's predecessor? A. Yes. And the governor certainly has the right to appoint his own people to state entities. Interestingly, since Katrina he's been speaking about the need for strengthening the levee system, which I take as a sign that the board's questioning did get some issues into the public square. Q. Do you believe that strengthening the levees is a good idea? A. In principle, yes. A lot of our levees are in terrible shape -- full of beavers and squirrels and rot. They were originally put up to protect farms. They were never built to protect big population centers. I am concerned, however, that strengthening the levees might spur the development of environments that probably should be left alone -- like the delta. When prospective homeowners see levees behind property, they feel satisfied that someone has addressed flooding dangers. They naïvely believe that the government wouldn't let them live where it wasn't safe. Few comprehend that the levees don't prevent flooding; they just reduce its frequency. Levees often give people a false sense of security. Q. Do you regret your service on the Reclamation Board? A. Not at all. We've got to get more scientists involved in this sort of thing. Before I sat on this board, I had no idea how flood policy worked. I thought I did, but everyday reality is very different. It's a series of compromises. It's messy. And it's good for scientists to get into that. If nothing else, it's good for scientists to be present when the professional staff comes before the board and gives the facts, as they know them. Scientists can ask the technical questions that might not otherwise get raised. So regrets? Nope! Besides, I still have my day job at the University of California, Davis. There, I've got tenure! A Conversation With Jeffrey Mount"
"Federal officials issued unexpectedly lenient guidelines on Wednesday for rebuilding the flood-damaged homes of New Orleans, potentially allowing tens of thousands of homeowners to return to their neighborhoods at costs far less than they had feared. Under the guidelines issued here by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, huge swaths of homes might still have to be rebuilt at least three feet off the ground, or risk getting no federal reconstruction money or insurance. But the announcement, anxiously anticipated as a critical step in rebuilding this still-ravaged city, was nonetheless greeted with some relief by local officials and residents. They had feared that, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina's catastrophic flooding, the government would demand that some houses be raised as much as 10 feet, at enormous expense. The lesser requirement assumes that the area's damaged levee system will be solidly reconstructed. To that end, federal officials also announced Wednesday that most of the system's 36 miles or so of flood walls -- which sit atop levees in places where massive earthen structures are not practical -- would be replaced. The cost for that and other levee improvements is $2.5 billion, which the Bush administration said Wednesday that it would actively seek from Congress. The announcement dovetails with a political climate in New Orleans in which the idea of not rebuilding damaged neighborhoods has been taboo. In a heated mayor's race that is now reaching its conclusion, no candidate has been willing to say some areas should not be rebuilt because of flood danger. Now, the federal government -- by making rebuilding requirements less stringent than had been anticipated -- appears to have concurred, though FEMA officials did not say specifically why they chose the three-foot figure. Some experts were critical of the decision. ''It's wacky,'' said J. Robert Hunter, a former director of the federal flood insurance program. ''Three feet -- where did that come from? Why are we building up three feet, when the water was up over the roof? ''What's that three feet going to do?'' Mr. Hunter asked. ''Instead of coming up with real science, they're making it up. Which means that people are going to be at risk, they're going to die again, and taxpayers are subsidizing unwise construction with very cheap insurance.'' In addition, though the upgraded levee system will guard against 100-year floods -- those that have a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year -- it will protect against the most powerful storms. ''One-hundred-year protection and Category 5 protection are not the same thing,'' said Lt. Gen. Carl Strock, the chief engineer of the Army Corps of Engineers. At one point over the Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Katrina was a Category 5 storm; when it made landfall along the coast last Aug. 29, it was described as Category 3 or 4. The greatest flood damage occurred after the storm had passed and the levees and flood walls gave way. Most officials here, though, said they were relieved that homeowners can get on with rebuilding now that the federal house-raising requirement is known. ''Over all, the new flood maps released by FEMA today truly do represent some good news for the city and its rebuilding process,'' said Greg Meffert, executive assistant to Mayor C. Ray Nagin. ''Essentially, these new maps more or less maintain the city to the already previously enforced 100-year flood elevation standards.'' For months, Louisiana authorities have complained that FEMA was dragging its feet in issuing new flood-elevation requirements, the first since the mid-1980's. The delay caused uncertainty for thousands of people, they said. Now mortgages can be applied for, and lives that had been on hold can move forward. ''I would view it as good news, and I would view it as information that we can use to get on with planning our lives,'' said Sean Reilly, of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, which will decide how federal rebuilding money is spent. He agreed with Donald Powell, the federal official in charge of Gulf Coast rebuilding, who said while making the announcement here, ''The good news is, it's not a dramatic-type elevation.'' As it is, many homes -- even severely damaged ones -- may not have to be raised at all, if they already meet or exceed the three-foot requirement. And since it applies only to homes that were destroyed or ''substantially damaged,'' which the guidelines describe as damage to more than half the structure, the potential impact is further reduced because city officials have been liberal in revising damage assessments downwards. In addition, virtually all two-story homes in which the first floor was wiped out but the second was untouched fall below the 50-percent threshold. ''It's good news for a lot of people,'' said Matt McBride of the Broadmoor Improvement Association. Broadmoor is a in a neighborhood that flooded badly. ''It's basically good news, in that people don't have to raise their houses to exceed Katrina flood levels. For a lot of historic homes, this doesn't change many things.'' LaToya Cantrell, for instance, president of the Broadmoor association, got five feet of water from Lake Pontchartrain, but because her house was already elevated by four feet, she will not have to raise it. Even in neighborhoods of newer houses, like those in eastern New Orleans, which was severely damaged by Katrina's flooding, the federal government's new requirement could be considered generous. ''All of the two-story houses in eastern New Orleans have less than 50 percent damage, and this doesn't affect them,'' said Mtumishi St. Julien, a homeowner in that area who heads the Housing Finance Authority of New Orleans. ''It's not going to drastically impact New Orleans, as some people suggest.'' FEMA officials, in making their announcement, declined to say how many homes would be affected, or whether the most popular, ground-level type of new construction -- slab-on-grade -- might still be allowed. The announcement by the Army Corps of Engineers that the flood walls would be replaced was the clearest admission yet by the corps that much of New Orleans' levee system had long been flawed, and was not simply overpowered by forces that went beyond what the system was designed to withstand. General Strock, the corps' chief engineer, said the entire system of flood walls would have to be examined to determine what must be replaced. ''We must assume that because the foundations of these levees are pretty much the same throughout the system'' the problem is widespread, he said. In a conference call after the announcement, General Strock said even the system being planned would not prevent flooding in New Orleans in the case of another hurricane like Katrina, ''But it will not be catastrophic flooding'' caused by a breach in the system, he said. Until the completion of the upgraded network of levees and flood walls, planned for 2010, he said, ''there is a heightened level of risk that will go down over time.'' Still uncertain is the fate of lower Plaquemines Parish, jutting into the Gulf of Mexico and severely flooded. Home to about 2 percent of the New Orleans area's population, the parish would require an additional $1.6 billion to raise its levee system to FEMA guidelines, money the Bush Administration has not promised to seek. Wednesday's advisory, as officials called it, opens the door to new flood-insurance maps, which will come later this year. Even for those who must raise their houses, the federal requirement could be good news because elevating a house by as little as five feet can cost more than $100,000. Up to $30,000 in federal money is available to homeowners for such projects. Whatever the opinions of outside experts, the new federal policy was viewed favorably here. ''Over all, it's good news in that FEMA has agreed Katrina was only a one-time event, and flood insurance won't be based on catastrophic events but on common sense,'' Mr. McBride of the Broadmoor association said."
"Only in France can selling wine be construed as a political act, but that is what the Socialist mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoë, is being accused of by auctioning off most of City Hall's ''grands crus,'' the finest wines accumulated during the tenure of his center-right predecessor, Jacques Chirac. ''It's demagogic!'' Anthony Rowley, a French food historian, huffed on Thursday, rankled by the mayor's highly publicized purging of the municipal wine cellar. Vast collections of vintage wine have been a mark of prestige for centuries in France, and City Hall's cellar is not unique. Tens of thousands of aging wine bottles sleep beneath some of the country's most powerful institutions, including _lysée Palace, the National Assembly, the Senate and several government ministries. The municipality's collection is kept below the fanciful Hôtel de Ville, on the right bank of the Seine. It was started when Mr. Chirac became mayor in 1977 and eventually grew to 10,000 bottles, stored in a state-of-the-art vaulted cellar 20 feet underground, where the humidity is kept at 87 percent and the temperature never varies from 54 degrees. Mr. Chirac used the collection to impress guests, pulling the cork on bottles of Château Pétrus for the first President Bush, Leonid Brezhnev and Pope John Paul II. Bernard Bled, then Mr. Chirac's chief of staff, said the mayor's office annually consumed hundreds of bottles of fine wine at fancy dinners. ''Drinking even 1,000 bottles a year is not enormous,'' Mr. Bled said on Thursday. But times have changed. Mr. Delanoë entertains less, and when he does, it is usually at Champagne-and-hors d'oeuvres receptions. The city's independent auditor reported last year that the mayor's office now serves only about 30 bottles of fine wine a year. ''There's a puritan side to this,'' Mr. Bled sniffed. ''I was always an epicurean.'' But the auditor noted that many of the best bottles in the city's wine cellar had appreciated in value to a point that they were worth too much to drink at city functions. ''No municipal reception can justify the consumption of a wine costing hundreds, even thousands of euros,'' the auditor's report said. Claude Maratier, the expert called in to appraise the wine, called Mr. Bled ''clairvoyant'' in his purchases years ago. Bottles of Château Haut-Brion that Mr. Bled bought for the equivalent of 50 euros, or about $63, each cost as much as $750 wholesale or $1,260 retail today. Mr. Delanoë has responded by putting 4,960 bottles of the most valuable bottles up for auction. The official reason given by City Hall is that the wine cellar is at risk of flooding and that it wants to reduce its stock to what it can store above the high water mark from the flood of 1910, the last time the Seine overflowed its banks in a big way. ''There's a limit to what we can put up high in the cellar,'' said Nicolas Milosevic, chief of protocol at the mayor's office. But offended oenophiles say the real reason is political. ''This is propaganda,'' said Mr. Rowley, the food historian, adding that the city could easily reduce its stock without so much publicity. He suggested that the auction had more to do with coming municipal elections than it did with the risk of a once-in-a-century flood. ''It underlines the modesty of the current municipal administration compared to the past.'' What is lost, both Mr. Rowley and Mr. Bled say, is the prestige that comes from giving city guests the best that the country has to offer. ''In London, they receive you with a sumptuous Porto, and in Rome, the mayor serves absolutely exceptional wines,'' Mr. Rowland said. Instead, Mr. Delanoë ''thinks it is fashionable and modern to serve little democratic wines.'' Mr. Maratier, the wine expert, who arranges periodic auctions of wine from private cellars, said the City Hall auction was unique because all of the wines were from top classifications, like premiers crus or grands crus -- meaning first growth or great growth -- and had been stored under optimum conditions without being moved. He has estimated the market value of the wine to be sold at almost $650,000, but said that based on the interest that the auction has received, it could bring in as much as $945,000. ''We have a Russian buyer coming from Moscow, and this morning there were two Chinese here to see the wines,'' he said, standing amid glass cases displaying a sampling of bottles as if they were in a museum. The wines will be auctioned on Friday and Saturday at the Crédit Municipal, which normally auctions off goods pawned to the state. The lots for sale include bottles of Château Margaux, Château Cheval-Blanc and Château d'Yquem, a favorite of Thomas Jefferson and Queen Elizabeth II. The most expensive bottle offered is a 1986 Romanee Conti, valued at $1,889 wholesale. Mr. Bled talks lovingly of the wines he bought. ''I remember them all,'' he said, adding that he purchased most of the wine while it was still in the barrel. Now he fears that the ''perfect'' wine cellar that he built will be used to store ''grapefruit and cases of Coke.'' ''I'm proud to have built such a collection,'' said Mr. Bled, ''but I'm a little sad that they didn't drink more.''"
"Heavy summer rains are coming to a small town along the Mississippi River, but the mayor (Joseph O'Brien) is in denial. ''Aw, c'mon,'' he tells a concerned farmer (Jonathan Rayson) who would like to see the levee shored up. ''The river's never come anywhere near the top.'' Famous last words. Since Peter Mills and Cara Reichel's musical is titled ''The Flood,'' there's little doubt that the fictional burg of Meyerville, Ill., is in for a dousing, if not a Hurricane Katrina-style apocalypse. Inspired by the devastating Midwest floods of 1993 and in the works since 2000, ''The Flood'' can't be blamed for being upstaged by last year's Gulf Coast deluge. What this eager, accomplished show can be rapped for, though, is that it manages to get nearly everything right, except the most crucial bit: its substance. Directed with sweep and flow by Ms. Reichel, and performed by an able, ingratiating cast of 23, ''The Flood'' plays like a demonstration-model American musical. As soundly constructed as Kanae Heike's woodsy, modular set, the show has an alternately soothing and majestic score that evokes the free-ranging Americana of Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (''Ragtime''). But this can't make us care a whit about the show's cookie-cutter characters: the aforementioned farmer and his indecisive schoolteacher fiancée (Catherine Porter); the glad-handing mayor and his hothead teenage son (Matt DeAngelis); or the son's sweet, bland girlfriend (Jamie Davis). Her family is marginally more interesting: Her dad, helpfully named Ezekiel (Drew Poling), has long prophesied the river's rise to deaf ears, and her mildly retarded sister (Jennifer Blood) is ominously overfond of the water, personified by a rag-covered, melisma-purring A'lisa D. Miles. Is the besieged Meyerville the show's true lead character? Anatevka it's not; this white-bread outpost makes Mayberry look positively outré. Bet the church choir sounds great, though. ''The Flood'' runs through Nov. 19 at the American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton; (212) 352-3101. THEATER REVIEW"
"The papers handed out by hawkers at subway entrances may be free, but the Metropolitan Transportation Authority says they have a cost -- they fall on the tracks and clog up drains in a way that can lead to flooding during heavy rains. An investigation conducted by the authority's board found that drains clogged by newspapers, predominantly the free papers that have proliferated in recent years, contributed to the flooding that disrupted the subway system during a torrential storm Sept. 8, 2004. ''We have complained bitterly for a long time about what we call the free newspapers,'' said Barry L. Feinstein, the board member who spearheaded the investigation. ''That was a major problem and cause of a good deal of the flooding.'' The problem occurs, he said, when subway riders discard the papers or hawkers leave them lying about so they blow onto the tracks. In the 2004 storm, more than three inches of rain linked to Hurricane Frances fell before and during the morning rush, disrupting subway lines for hours. Calling the storm ''an act of God,'' Mr. Feinstein said his findings contradicted a previous investigation by the authority's inspector general. The earlier inquiry noted the problem with litter on the tracks but also charged that lack of maintenance and an inadequate response greatly worsened the flooding and its impact. The authority refused to release a report on the latest investigation. Charles Seaton, a spokesman for New York City Transit, said the agency had increased the number of workers who clean trash off the track bed to 198 from 118 over the last year. There are also two vacuum trains that clean underground sections of track. One of the free dailies, AM New York, began distribution in October 2003, according to Floyd Weintraub, a senior vice president. He said he was not aware of any complaints that the paper had received from the transportation authority. He said that about 300,000 copies of the paper are distributed daily and that the paper employs about 160 hawkers who press the paper into the hands of commuters and passers-by. ''We have an extensive and a very professional distribution system,'' Mr. Weintraub said. ''When a real problem is brought to our attention, we respond to it and solve it as quickly as we can.'' Lori Rosen, a spokeswoman for Metro New York, another free paper, said it employs hawkers at about 160 subway stations and has a daily distribution of about 300,000. She said the hawkers are supposed to remain outside the stations and are told not to leave behind stacks of unused papers. The New York Times has an arrangement with Metro New York to print classified ads in the free paper."
"A federal judge offered a glimmer of hope to the tens of thousands of people whose homes and businesses in New Orleans were flooded in Hurricane Katrina, ruling that insurance companies should pay for the widespread water damage. If upheld, the ruling late Monday by Judge Stanwood R. Duval Jr. of Federal District Court in New Orleans could cost the insurers billions of dollars more than the $41 billion they have already paid to storm victims. But the insurers insist that their policies do not cover flooding, and they said yesterday that they expected an appeals court to reverse the decision. A final ruling could take months, if not years. Judge Duval's decision centered on the distinction between flooding caused by high winds and heavy rains and flooding caused by human error. Much of the destruction in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 was a result of levee failures. He said the language in the insurance policies on flood coverage was ambiguous because it did not ''clearly exclude man-made'' flood disasters. Since the insurers provided the wording for the policies, he said he felt ''constrained to interpret it against the insurers.'' He made an exception for State Farm and the Hartford Insurance Company, whose policies do not provide coverage for flooding ''regardless of cause.'' Lawyers for more than a dozen homeowners and Xavier University, which had business insurance, hailed Judge Duval's decision as a victory. ''This is a major breakthrough,'' said John N. Ellison, a member of the team of lawyers representing storm victims and a partner at Anderson Kill & Olick in New York. ''Our hope is that this ruling may help get the redevelopment of the houses and the city going so the city can come back to life.'' The ruling was the first by a court in Louisiana on damage from Hurricane Katrina. It ran counter to rulings by a federal judge in Mississippi that supported the industry's contention that most property insurance policies do not provide coverage for flooding. But the judge in Mississippi, L. T. Senter of Federal District Court, disagreed with the insurers' contention that any damage due to flooding nullified the coverage. He cleared the way for trials early next year to determine how much damage to flooded homes and businesses resulted from high winds. The rulings differ, in part, because the nature of the flooding was different. In Mississippi, the storm drove water from the Gulf of Mexico ashore and wiped out tens of thousands of homes unprotected by artificial barriers. In New Orleans, flood waters breached some levees and poured into the city as the storm was moving away. The water lingered in parts of the city for weeks. Mr. Ellison, the lawyer for the homeowners, said he believed that the New Orleans case would go to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ''on an expedited basis'' and that deliberations could begin in the spring. More than 200,000 homes and thousands of businesses were damaged or destroyed by the flooding in New Orleans. The insurers have refused to pay claims for water damage and the relatively small amounts that homeowners and businesses received for wind damage have been far from enough for most people to rebuild. The federal government has stepped in with promises of several billion dollars in assistance, but little of the money has reached the people who need it. The insurers said that Judge Duval's decision was contrary to decades of case law and state insurance regulation and would turn out to be a short-lived loss for their side. ''The judge reached the wrong conclusion,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York. ''The policies clearly exclude flood-related damage under any and all circumstances. We don't believe the decision will be upheld.'' Randy J. Maniloff, a lawyer in Philadelphia who represents insurance companies, including several of those in the New Orleans lawsuit, said Judge Duval appeared to be overreaching to solve the social and economic problems caused by Hurricane Katrina. ''Here is a phenomenon for which there is no insurance, and the court isn't going to allow that to exist,'' Mr. Maniloff said. ''The court is finding who is in a better position to bear the loss, and it is coming out in favor of the individual, the policyholder,'' he said. ''This is an aberration.'' Judge Duval, who was appointed to the federal court by President Bill Clinton in 1994, said in an 85-page decision that the insurers could have made clear ''that 'flood' means water damage caused by negligent acts or omissions.'' But, he said, they ''chose not to do so.'' Nearly a dozen insurance companies had sought dismissal of the lawsuits over flood losses. But Judge Duval ruled in favor of only two, State Farm, the largest home insurer in Louisiana, with about 20 percent of the market; and Hartford, a unit of the Hartford Financial Services Group, which has a much smaller share. Judge Duval said he cleared the way for an immediate appeal because ''there is a substantial ground for a difference of opinion.''"
"To move this tiny town to higher ground is not such a stretch for the short term. Residents here have done it for years when the big rains have come. Roll up the rugs. Empty the kitchen cabinets. Put the good furniture on the second floor and hope the river does not rise that high. Then load up the RV and head north of Highway 20 to the church. ''They're actually getting a little better at this, unfortunately,'' said the Rev. Ron Edwards, the pastor of the First Baptist Church and a foul-weather host to many of Hamilton's refugees. Most of the about 300 residents of Hamilton repeated their weary routine this week, when an immense band of moisture, known as the Pineapple Express for its origins in tropical waters near Hawaii, dumped record rain and drove rivers to new heights across western Washington and Oregon. The storm killed three people, breached levees, flooded farms, washed out roads and forced hundreds of evacuations. And here in Hamilton, 80 miles northeast of Seattle, where the Skagit River once again ignored its ostensible banks, where mud now slicks the ramp that Dave Thompson uses to roll his wheelchair to his front door, where ''flood line'' signs mark the head-high reach of the river in 2003, this last storm has renewed attention, and momentum, to the idea of moving Hamilton to higher ground for good. ''The only problem we have with it is that we don't have a program that buys new town sites,'' said Carl Cook, the mitigation director for the regional office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Washington State. And so the Hamilton Public Development Authority was born in 2004. The group, an agency created by the town with a board that includes representatives of local Indian tribes and the Nature Conservancy, wants to move Hamilton, minus the mud, across Highway 20 to about 200 acres of private land on a dry hillside. Supporters of the move say it would serve dual purposes: improving the lives of Hamilton residents, many of whom cannot afford to move on their own, and improving the Skagit, home to one of the largest wintering colonies of bald eagles in the country and a spawning site for six species of salmon. The greatest challenge now is buying the new land. Board members say it would cost about $4 million, which they hope to raise from the federal and state government. But another challenge would be actually moving the people, not all of whom say they want to go. ''We're too old to start over,'' said Kathy Lipsey, 59, who moved to Hamilton with her husband, Ed, 64, a hay farmer, about 15 years ago. The couple knew about Hamilton's history of flooding when they moved into a double-wide mobile home there. But the price was right. This year they raised their house three feet, using hydraulic jacks and concrete blocks. ''You always can convince yourself that you're going to be a little better prepared than you are,'' Mr. Lipsey said. ''But the floods come differently each time.'' It has been a soggy century for Hamilton, which once thrived on coal mining and logging but fell into depression after the timber industry declined in the 1980s. Library archives have images of floods from the 1890s. On skagitriverhistory.com, there are links to newspaper articles about floods published as far back as 1896, when Hamilton was ''totally inundated'' by flooding. The floods never stopped, but people stayed, rebuilding after floods as recent as 1990, 1995, 1996 and 2003. FEMA estimates that it has spent at least $10 million helping Hamilton recover over the years, but supporters of the move say the actual figure could be $20 million or more. While Hamilton would not be the first river town in the nation to move, its plan for doing so is distinctive. Over the course of 20 years, Hamilton's riverfront lots would slowly slip from the map through a kind of land swap that is part environmentalism, part social engineering. The new town could have up to 400 lots. No one would be forced to relocate, but the new development authority would buy property and help people move. The authority, said Patrick M. Hayden, a lawyer who is the part-time town attorney, would raise some money by selling land on the new town site and then use that money to buy property in the old part of town, preventing it from being developed again. Residents of Hamilton and other parts of the Skagit River floodway could buy or rent in the new town site at discounted rates. At the same time, the river, which twists 163 miles from British Columbia to the Puget Sound, would offer that much more undisturbed habitat along its banks. Gayle Poole, a cook at Joy's Bakery in Sedro-Woolley, about 12 miles west, said she moved from Hamilton after the floods of 1995 and 1996. Ms. Poole said she knew some people had stayed in Hamilton solely to file claims with FEMA after each flood. ''To me it's stupid to keep pouring out the taxpayers' money when the solution's right there on that hill,'' she said, referring to the proposed new town site. Mr. Cook, the FEMA official, acknowledged there was room for abuse but said, ''There's an obligation on FEMA to make sure claims are paid.'' Mr. Edwards, the pastor, said he believed few people were exploiting FEMA. ''By and large, they're the exceptions,'' he said. ''The norm is that people don't have the money to move.'' As for residents who say they like life in Hamilton as it is and would not want to move to the new town, ''I think that's kind of a smokescreen,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''I think they would get out, if they knew they really could.''"
"A volatile storm system killed at least 12 people and injured dozens more across the Southeast before heading north, prompting forecasters to issue flash-flood warnings from Virginia to Maine. Powerful winds and tornadoes ripped off roofs, demolished houses, tossed trucks and toppled trees in six states, leaving at least 13,500 people without power. Forecasters said that though the storms were weakening, coastal and low-lying areas farther up the coast should look out for heavy rains, flooding and downed power lines through Friday morning. One tornado that hit a mobile home park near Riegelwood, N.C., around 7 a.m. Thursday was responsible for many of the fatalities. ''It appears that the tornado touched down in a mobile home area,'' said Gov. Michael F. Easley of North Carolina in an afternoon news conference. It damaged 30 to 40 houses, skipped over a highway and leveled some brick houses on the other side, Mr. Easley said. Alton Edwards, the retired chief of Acme-Delco Riegelwood Fire and Rescue, responded to the scene and likened it to a war zone. ''It was total devastation,'' he said. ''It looked almost like the mobile homes had exploded from the ground up.'' That twister killed at least eight adults and children there and sent about 20 more people to the hospital, Mr. Easley said. Mr. Edwards said he had seen an elderly couple lying in a yard, 150 feet from their overturned trailer, and found a member of the fire and rescue unit who had been killed. Lillian Graham, 63, of the East Arcadia Fire Department, arrived at the scene early in the morning and saw the tornado move along its path, apparently throwing people out of their trailers. ''We saw trees had been broken like sticks,'' Ms. Graham said in a telephone interview. ''The tornado was above ground, it went over a brick house and two or three trailers and hit the ground. It then picked up one trailer, took it over the top of trees for about 30 or 40 feet or more, slammed it down and broke it into pieces.'' She said bodies were found in front of patches of earth where a trailer had been. ''Another worker came out of the woods and said: 'There are bodies all over here. I can't take it. I am leaving,' '' she said. Thirty families are now housed in a local shelter, Mr. Easley said. The major highway through the area, North Carolina 87, was closed because it was blocked by debris. Ron Steve, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the service was unlikely to be able to measure the strength of the Riegelwood tornado until Friday. But the twister was forceful enough to send Martin Brown, 39, of Riegelwood, diving under a kitchen table when he saw it barreling toward his house. ''It was nothing but a big old brown twister coming straight at me,'' Mr. Brown said. ''I thought I was going to die.'' He watched as his refrigerator was blown away, and the brick and cinderblock walls of his house started to crumble. One wall fell against the table, shielding him from flying debris. He survived with only scratches and cuts. Some Riegelwood residents said that they were awakened early by what sounded like a hurricane. ''The rain was pounding and beating on the windows of the house,'' said Marjorie Graham, 46, a teacher. ''The wind was strong. When I looked out the window, I could see the leaves and branches breaking off the trees.'' Ms. Graham said her aunt had been at the site helping to pull bodies from the wreckage, but she became so overwhelmed that she eventually left. ''That one came up out of nowhere,'' Ms. Graham said of the storm. ''They had forecast heavy rain, but we didn't realize the wind was going to be so severe.'' The tornado was one of at least a dozen generated by a pair of storm systems with fierce winds and torrential rainfall that moved across the Southeast. Two people were killed in storm-related auto accidents in North Carolina. In South Carolina, a utility worker checking power lines was electrocuted Thursday, and another man was killed by a tornado that destroyed his mobile home near Greensburg, La., early Wednesday morning. The storm that swept through North Carolina was part of that system, Tom Bradshaw, a meteorologist with the Southern Regional Headquarters of the National Weather Service in Fort Worth, said. Kip Godwin, chairman of the Columbus County Board of Commissioners in North Carolina, said he had heard a report from an emergency worker about a child found in a ditch, still alive, who was taken to a local hospital. ''I don't think these folks had very much warning,'' Mr. Godwin said."
"Outside, the rain was cascading in sheets, pounding on windshields, roiling rivers and tributaries, lakes and ponds, water, too much water, and then some more. Inside Hancock High School, in the nether reaches of the Catskills on Thursday night, Hancock's town supervisor, Sam Rowe, greeted visitors in a T-shirt from last June's storm reading, ''Come Hell or High Water -- Flood of 2006.'' He hung around for a while until his phone beeped, listened for a moment and then rushed out. Route 17, the main drag, was closed to the west because of flooding. You looked at the topic that had sucked people out into this soggy mess, ''Before the Next Flood: What Your Community Can Do!'' and thought, ''Whoops, too late.'' Luckily, that wasn't quite right. Thursday's heavy rains produced some minor local flooding. Still, it wasn't Strike 4 in the biblical plague of flooding upstate that has produced disasters that are not supposed to occur for a century or more over the last two years. But the frustration and anger seething through the high school cafeteria, the Babel of hydrology and bureaucratese, the pulls of competing constituencies made you think, man, they better figure out something before the next flood, because people can take only so much, and they already have. ''We were recovering from two floods, and then we got hit with one of a magnitude that no one alive has ever seen around here,'' Mr. Rowe said. ''It could take 10 years to totally recover from this last one -- and that's assuming we don't get another one we have to deal with.'' So about three dozen local officials and frustrated residents braved one downpour to contemplate a worse one on Thursday night. Here's what's at stake: The Delaware River is the longest nondammed river east of the Mississippi, extending 330 miles from the Catskills to the mouth of the Delaware Bay. Nearly 15 million people -- about 5 percent of the nation's population -- rely on it and 216 tributaries for drinking water and industrial uses. New York City gets half of its water from three reservoirs on the Delaware, and countless towns from here to the Atlantic exist because the river does. From 1955 to 1996, there were no major floods. Now, it seems, there's one every year. The Delaware River Basin Commission, which manages the river system, has begun a flood mitigation study, but on Thursday you could hear the frustration in the voice of every resident who spoke. ''I hear the word rain, and I hear a four-letter word,'' said Joan Homovich, a retired teacher, who estimates her basement has flooded 10 times since 2003 and now obsessively goes online studying water releases from the reservoirs on the river. ''When I thought about this rain I couldn't eat.'' Part of the difficulty is a blizzard of conflicting agendas. New York City, which controls the reservoirs, wants to be assured of drinking water for more than eight million people. Upstate residents want the city to also use the reservoirs to manage river flows and minimize flooding. Fishermen and environmentalists want to protect fisheries and limit man-made disruptions on the river. Towns want to be able to dredge and clean out streams to improve water flows that would prevent flooding. At Thursday night's meeting, the second of two last week, there was all sorts of information: about where to build homes and how to retrofit existing ones to protect them from flooding; about flood insurance and managing water flows. But the issue that people cared most about was one with no solution in sight -- whether New York City's Department of Environmental Protection has any real interest in managing its reservoirs, now full yet again, for flood control as well as for providing water to the city. Residents want the agency to release water and lower the reservoir levels, creating a void that could trap rainfall that could otherwise cause flooding. The agency says its options are limited because the reservoirs are not built for flood control. But for the first time it has said it would make efforts in that direction. Residents say the city is already failing to deliver. (The agency says reservoirs are now at 100.5 percent of capacity. Normal is 70 percent.) ''We're looking at full reservoirs and it's raining like hell,'' said Chuck Schroeder, who has a log home he built near Hancock that was flooded out in 2005 and then in June. ''I look out there, and I see exactly the same conditions we've had over the last three floods.'' This year in the Catskills is among the wettest on record, but who knows what to read into a few years of wet weather. Freak of nature? Global warming? Thirty-year rainfall cycle? Act of God? No one knows, and there are acts of nature that are beyond the machinations of man. But as people rushed through the downpour to their cars they did know one thing: after three catastrophic floods in two years, there's little in place that would make a fourth any different.

"Players at South Plaquemines High taped their ankles by the blue and red lights of a police car. Coach Cyril Crutchfield studied his game plan by the white lights of another sheriff's cruiser. Inside a makeshift dressing room, linebacker Sal Cepriano adjusted his helmet visor in the pale glow of two cellphones. Exterior lights from an ambulance provided illumination for the ticket booth. As the team warmed up at dusk on Friday for a playoff game here, the stadium lights faltered. Music on the sound system slurred to a halt. A backhoe had hit a power line in the area, and electricity went out for nearly two hours along a stretch of Highway 23. Players retreated from the evening chill to the warmth of the mobile office that served as a dressing room. They spread out on the floor, resting on equipment bags and shoulder pads. Lying quietly in the dark, they resembled evacuees from a more turbulent maelstrom, the one they survived 14 1/2 months ago when Hurricane Katrina roared through. Devin Boutwell, a defensive lineman, admonished his teammates to remain calm. Still, some grew impatient. Occasionally, someone shouted a curse. Guard Dwayne Ancar paced the floor and pounded one wall with his gloved hands. ''We're ready to go,'' Ancar said. ''This is taking too long.'' Finally the game began, more than an hour late. From the beginning, newly formed South Plaquemines appeared flat, drained of energy and resolve in what wound up as a 48-16 defeat to Clinton. The Hurricanes lined up incorrectly on offense and forgot to call defensive signals. They tackled poorly, fumbled twice and threw five interceptions in a loss that ended a season of hope, perseverance and, ultimately, frustration. Perhaps South Plaquemines (5-7) was simply overmatched Friday. Maybe players were emotionally spent after a stunning playoff comeback a week earlier, or satisfied with simply reaching the playoffs after a difficult season played without a locker room and a weight room, or even a home field for all but one regular-season game and one playoff game. ''With everything that they've been through, when something bad happens, they put their heads down,'' Crutchfield said of his team's fragile confidence. After the game, the sophomore quarterback Ridge Turner lay on his back in despair. The team's seniors took the defeat particularly hard. Once rivals, they had come together from the devastated communities of Port Sulphur, Buras and Boothville-Venice. Now their careers were over, and they were facedown on the field or sitting disconsolately, their shoulders heaving as they sobbed. Their parents approached and urged them to their feet. Mike Barthelemy Sr., whose son, Mike Jr., is an eighth-grade linebacker, walked among the players and said: ''Thank every one of you. It took a lot of courage to come back and play. You've been through a hell of a lot. I'm proud of everyone.'' Crutchfield, the coach, was too distraught to address his team. He stood with his hands on his hips, staring into the distance. Later, in the dressing room, he put his head down on a table, then pulled his shirt to his face and cried softly. He had won a state championship at Port Sulphur High in 2002 and was accustomed to playing regularly beyond Thanksgiving. ''What am I going to do?'' he said vacantly. For the seniors, time had also run out. Boutwell had wanted to graduate in lower Plaquemines, as close as possible to his destroyed home in Buras. But after returning for the playoffs from what he believed to be a career-ending knee injury in September, Boutwell said he would probably transfer to Ponchatoula High School, northwest of New Orleans. There, he would work with an athletic trainer as he continues to rehabilitate his knee. He still hoped to receive an athletic scholarship or an invitation to play in college as a walk-on. ''I can't work out down here; there's no facilities, no nothing,'' Boutwell said. Still, he added, he had no regrets about returning to lower Plaquemines for his senior season. ''Home is where the heart is,'' Boutwell said. ''I think we pulled out a lot more wins than anybody thought we would.'' Just opening the school was an achievement that many believed was impossible, said Stanley Gaudet, the principal at South Plaquemines. ''Most people expected us to fall flat on our faces,'' Gaudet said. Yet the future holds no answers, only questions. Even the permanent location of South Plaquemines High School is not expected to be decided for several years. For now, it is situated in temporary buildings on the ruined campus of Port Sulphur High. There is no usable gym, so the boys' and girls' basketball teams must travel 23 miles south to Boothville for practice. Players who live in northern Plaquemines, or in greater New Orleans, will have to travel 60 or more miles home each evening. Wrestling has started, too, but the team trains in a makeshift cafeteria, moving tables to one side of the room and unfurling mats on the other. The school has adequate textbooks and supplies, Gaudet said. But there are not enough books in some subjects for students to take home. ''Every time I ask for a pencil, they start fussing,'' said Maverick Ancar, an eighth-grade defensive back. Irregular signs of recovery are evident in lower Plaquemines, where Katrina struck with 120-mile-an-hour winds and a 28-foot storm surge, damaging or destroying almost every structure, stranding barges atop levees and depositing boats on the highway. Coffins popped out of the ground and cows were left hanging by their necks in trees. Many businesses in Port Sulphur have returned or are rebuilding. Since the football season began, the post office has opened and some streetlights have been installed on Highway 23, the only road in and out of this narrow peninsula. Thirteen miles south in Buras, though, almost no evidence of recovery exists. There is no longer any school there. And, according to Roger Halphen, an assistant football coach and head wrestling coach at South Plaquemines who lived in Buras before Katrina, hope for its future was dwindling. ''They're killing my town,'' Halphen said, echoing others. ''Sometimes, you feel like giving up. When people you were born and raised with don't come back, you feel pretty lonely.'' At least wrestling would provide welcome distraction until February. By then, he said, people might have more answers about recovery money and flood insurance. Last week, Louisiana's governor, Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, criticized the slow pace of the state's recovery process, saying that only 27 of about 120,000 eligible families had received home-rebuilding grants, worth up to $150,000 apiece, under the Road Home program. Many students at South Plaquemines continue to live in FEMA trailer parks, both near the school and as far as 30 miles away. ''It's time to get people in full-size trailers and permanent housing because of the stress,'' Billy Nungesser, the newly elected parish president, told The Plaquemines Gazette. The geographic vulnerability of lower Plaquemines is also striking, particularly at South Plaquemines High, which sits on a thin strip of land, not a half-mile wide, between the Mississippi River and marshes that lead to the Gulf of Mexico. The federal government has said it will not immediately spend the $1.6 billion needed to fully fortify levees at the lower end of the parish, because so few people have returned. A state plan would also not provide lower Plaquemines any greater protection than before Katrina, according to news accounts. Meanwhile, serious talk has been revived, by scientists and state officials, of diverting the Mississippi in lower Plaquemines so it can deposit vital silt and restore the shriveling coastline, where continued erosion of marshland has shrunk what served as a natural hurricane buffer. Such a contentious plan has fostered two local reactions -- dismissal for its seeming impracticality and fear that that the lower parish would be abandoned, disturbing vital industries of fishing and oil and gas and again uprooting residents who have just begun to rebuild from Katrina. This fear mirrors a general apprehension that, in the words of Gaudet, the South Plaquemines principal, ''They won't rebuild the lower community; that they will leave us here and forget about us and not give us everything we need.'' Late Friday night, after he stopped crying, Crutchfield said he would take satisfaction in the spirit of his players, who lost everything in the hurricane, returned here to live in FEMA trailers and traveled 60 miles round-trip to practice each day for weeks, while subsisting at school on ham and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Three months into the school year, the cafeteria is still not operational. ''For the kids to hang in there, they showed tremendous resiliency,'' Crutchfield said, ticking off a list of the season's hardships: the daily travel, the lack of a home field, the combining of three schools into one. Next year, South Plaquemines, with 175 students in grades 9 through 12, will drop from Class 2A to Class 1A and compete in football against Louisiana's smallest schools. Already, the Hurricanes are being considered a favorite to win a state title. ''I think we have a legitimate shot,'' Crutchfield said. FOOTBALL"
"Dave and Karyn Mennier's plans for a wild backyard Memorial Day party have literally been sunk by the Merrimack River. The normally placid river, whose banks lie 150 feet from the Menniers' back door here, has swallowed up the entire yard, washing away a volleyball net, a sand pit and a wire fence, submerging a swing set and a three-foot concrete wall and spilling into the family's above-ground pool in the worst flooding in New England in 70 years. ''This is just such a mess,'' Ms. Mennier said as she stared at the lake where family and friends once threw horseshoes. The damage included three feet of water in her basement, where computer monitors and television screens floated. ''It's exhausting,'' she said. ''I've missed work. The cleanup is going to be the worst part.'' Across Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, thousands of residents faced similar challenges, as the driving rains that delivered more than a foot of water over five days started to let up. In Topsfield, Mass., the police found the body of James M. Elderkin, 59, of Derry, N.H., in his submerged car on a closed road in what appeared to be the first fatality from the storm. Two men seen floating in the Merrimack River swam to shore, Coast Guard officials said. Officials said the worst of the flooding was over, as the Spicket and Shawsheen Rivers in Massachusetts, the Merrimack in both Massachusetts and New Hampshire and the Mousam in Maine had crested. The streams will remain above flood stage until at least Thursday, officials at the National Weather Service said. ''We've definitely turned the corner,'' said a spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, Peter Judge. Mr. Judge warned that problems might continue, saying: ''There are still sandbag requests. We're still fighting the flood, if you will.'' Contamination remains a major problem for the Merrimack, as millions of gallons of sewage continued to pour into it after the main sewer in Haverhill broke and the treatment plant in Lawrence failed. ''The big, big problem is the break in the waste treatment line,'' Mayor James J. Fiorentini of Haverhill said. ''That will be two to three days before its back online. The major concern we have is that the folks whose houses are flooded don't get contaminated.'' William Babcock, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, said showers would continue off and on through Monday, with local downpours that could prevent rivers from receding. Most dams in the region held up, although officials monitored the Spicket River Dam in Methuen, Mass., which was reinforced with 5,000 sandbags. A small dam on Pillsbury Lake in Webster, N.H., broke on Monday night, nearly draining the lake, but no damage was reported. ''We're all a little nervous,'' Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts said at a news conference next to the Spicket Dam. ''But the dam has held up.'' Downstream in Lawrence, officials removed 240 patients from a nursing home on the Spicket River, which overflowed onto a bridge, submerged a baseball complex and turned Bennington Street into a tributary. Gerry Spagnuolo watched amphibious police vehicles drive past an apartment building that he owns and has been unable to go to as the water rose to its doorknob. ''I'm in shock,'' Mr. Spagnuolo said. In New Hampshire, more than 700 roads remained closed, and more than 400 National Guard members patrolled the eight flooded counties, said James Van Dongen, a spokesman for the State Bureau of Public Safety. About 200 to 400 families were removed from Bristol, N.H., along the Newfound River in the central part of the state, because a dam was clogged with debris and had loose welds on its steel beams. ''We're very concerned about it,'' Gov. John Lynch said. ''We're watching very carefully.'' In Massachusetts, about 800 National Guard members were activated, including the 25 or 30 who were in the Menniers' backyard. ''We're here to sandbag,'' one Guard member said. The Menniers, their two daughters, ages 12 and 14, and Ms. Mennier's 7-year-old nephew watched the troops throw sandbags to one another across the back deck. The Guard also showed up at the house of Karen and Tom Copeland, down the street, at 11 a.m. The family propped television sets and furniture on recycling bins and chairs in case the river, just outside their back door, invaded. Neighborhood children congregated at the house, photographing the Guard members. ''This is awesome,'' said Dylan Copeland, 11, standing next to a door propped open by a field jacket. For Ms. Mennier, the military presence was not so comforting. ''It's kind of a scare,'' she said. ''Whenever you see something like that, the uniforms, you think war. I guess it's supposed to be a good feeling. But not to be mean, they're late. Sorry guys, the damage is done.''"
"After days of record rainfall, rivers in Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire have spilled over their banks, causing thousands of residents to flee their homes and brace for what could be the region's worst flooding in 70 years. Storms have poured more than a foot of rain throughout the region since Friday, with at least another inch expected by Tuesday morning. No deaths were reported, but the Coast Guard was searching for two people seen floating down the Merrimack River in Amesbury, Mass., on Monday afternoon after a floating bridge broke free of its moorings. As the rains continued on Monday, residents were evacuated and floated through towns in canoes, cars were submerged up to their roofs, major roadways, including Route 1 in Massachusetts, were closed, sewage systems were failing, and people tried to come to grips with flood damage that, despite four days of rain, took them by surprise. ''I don't think anybody anywhere expected what hit us,'' said Yetta Chin of Kennebunk, Me., whose three-bedroom ranch house was destroyed by the flooding Mousam River on Sunday night. Ms. Chin, her husband, Stephen, and their three children were ordered to evacuate at 2:30 Sunday morning, when the water in the backyard was chest-high, she said in a phone interview. The family does not have flood insurance, she said. Schools in the region were closed on Monday, and some were to remain closed Tuesday. St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H., an Episcopal boarding school, suffered extensive damage after the Turkey River spilled its banks. The Merrimack River in Massachusetts crested Monday afternoon at six feet above flood level and is expected to stay that high until Wednesday, the National Weather Service said. A number of its tributaries in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, including the Spicket River in Methuen, Mass., and the Shawsheen River in Billerica, Mass., were beyond flood stage and had not yet crested. Officials were particularly concerned about a weak dam on the Spicket River. If it fails, downtown Methuen could flood. Gov. John Lynch of New Hampshire declared a disaster in eight of the state's 10 counties, and called out more than 400 National Guard troops to assist with evacuations and to guard the more than 600 roads that have closed. ''You can go to a town in any of those eight counties and find flood damage,'' Mr. Lynch said. In Massachusetts, tens of thousands of gallons of sewage were spewing into the Merrimack River after Haverhill's main sewage line broke and the Lawrence's sewage treatment facility flooded. Lowell's drinking water plant is in danger of shutting down. ''We're under siege; water is coming out everywhere,'' said Frederick Laskey, executive director of the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, which provides water and sewer services to 43 municipalities. ''This is overwhelming.'' The first part of the storm system, which hit the area late last week, was fed by moisture that came up from the Gulf of Mexico and sat off the shoreline. The second wave came from a system stuck in the Ohio River Valley. The two essentially set up a conveyor belt of moisture that will not be gone until Wednesday, said meteorologists at the National Weather Service in Taunton, Mass. In Methuen, Karen Baggetta, a visiting nurse, and her husband, Nick, a state trooper, hauled belongings out of their house next to the Spicket River. The first floor was flooded, and the living area was on the brink of flooding. ''Our house is an island in the middle of the river,'' Ms. Baggetta said in a phone interview. After the house flooded in 1987, the family raised it five feet. This time, she does not want to go back. ''It's devastating,'' Ms. Baggetta said. ''All those feelings come flooding back -- ha-ha. But I'm out of here. We're so out of here. I can't go through this again.''"
"Nicholas Tilton and Jamie Lucier's wedding ceremony was supposed to be held outside an old lumber mill here on May 20, with a waterfall on the Suncook River serving as the perfect backdrop. The river, however, had other plans, and chose not to show up. A week before the wedding, the Suncook River jumped its banks and cut a new course during torrential rains and flooding, leaving a 1.52-mile stretch of what was once river close to empty. Now, the patio of the restaurant that replaced the mill is overlooking two dams and some rocks, all bone-dry. State officials are still trying to determine why the river moved. One theory is that a man-made gravel pit near the river removed sediment that would have created a natural dam. Another is that the area contains a natural depression. Or it could be a combination of the two. ''It flooded over, but when the water receded it took the path of least resistance,'' said David Wunsch, the New Hampshire state geologist. ''It found a path where it could get out of its channel and make a shortcut. Why it did -- that is a question.'' Victor Baker, a professor of hydrology at the University of Arizona who is not familiar with the situation in Epsom, said that changing course was a natural process in the history of a river, and that it could occur more quickly because of construction or other human interference. The process is relatively common in large rivers with big flood plains, including the Mississippi, but is less common in New England. ''In New England, the flood plains are relatively narrow, maybe a few miles across,'' Professor Baker said. ''The rivers can shift across those, and it may seem dramatic in a small town.'' ''It's not as common in New England'' as in other places, he added. No homes or businesses were destroyed along the Suncook River's new course. But what the river left behind is striking -- moss-covered rocks, quicksand and a huge sandy pit that looks like a scene from the Southwest. Many residents now refer to it as the Grand Canyon. The river's new path has caused a controversy in this town, 11 miles east of Concord. Should the river be allowed to stay where it is or be moved back to its old bed? Owners of businesses and land along the river, as well as people downstream who now have sand and silt in their backyards, want it put back. Some other people would rather let nature take its course and leave the river where it is. Others don't want to foot a hefty bill to redirect it. ''We want them to reroute the river back because we don't want to lose the river,'' said Rich Paro, who works at the Lazy River Campground. The river was once the campground's main attraction, drawing canoeists and kayakers. The campground was severely flooded, but is open and full for the holiday weekend, even though it is now by an almost dry riverbed. ''People like the river,'' Mr. Paro said. Donna Mailhot-Dornhofer, who owns Center Epsom Antiques, thinks the river knows what is best. ''If we're not going to get the Old Man in the Mountain back, we're not going to get a river back,'' she said, referring to the state's iconic rock figure, which collapsed in 2003. ''I don't want to be putting my tax money into that.'' There are also environmental concerns. The river contains a rare mussel that is on the state's endangered list. The shift's effect on the mussel is unknown. The town has asked the state to study putting the river back, and various agencies are scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss the situation. A town meeting is planned for next Monday. In town, many theories abound as to why the shift happened and how the river could be put back. Al Bickford, 73, a lifelong resident whose father used to own the mill, is the town's resident river expert. Mr. Bickford thinks the breach happened in a place where officials removed a beaver dam about 10 years ago, weakening the bank. Robert Griggs, who owns the land the mill is on, suggested building a beaverlike dam with cut trees and sand, saying the river could be back to its old course in a week. Julie Clermont, a town selectwoman who lives near the river, said she was not sure what the town would do. But she said that because of budgetary restrictions, any action would require a special vote. ''It's dividing the town,'' Ms. Clermont said. She said she would side with the townspeople if it were put to a vote, but is not sure how she feels about the issue. Ms. Claremont enjoyed kayaking on the river when it flowed near her home, and she said she was uncertain whether moving it back was a good idea. Nature decided to move the river on May 14 and 15. Town officials and volunteers sandbagged the dams near the mill and points along the river that were prone to flooding. Suddenly, residents said, the high water at the dam by the mill started to recede and flow backward until it drained out like a bathtub, exposing the rocky bed. Mr. Bickford worked with the Fire Department to pinpoint possible flooding spots, but missed the one where it breached. ''That old son of a gun blindsided me,'' Mr. Bickford said. ''I've got to say, emotionally, it hurts. It's like losing an old friend. I've lived on the river, fished the river. The river has always been a part of my life.'' As for Mr. Tilton and Ms. Lucier, their wedding in the old mill went on as planned. The couple was married outside in front of a large rock. Mr. Tilton's mother, Leigh, said she had been extremely nervous about the rain and had prayed all week before the wedding for the water to go down, so the restaurant would not flood and the couple could marry near the waterfall. ''God must have misunderstood my prayer because the water did go down, all of it!'' she said in an e-mail message. ''There is no waterfall. There is no river! Just an empty riverbed. The reception hall was dry. Another example to be careful what you pray for!''"
"If ever there was a moment for the obscure federal flood insurance program to ride to the rescue, it would seem to have been in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Its premiums were supposed to insure homeowners in flood-prone areas and also protect taxpayers from spending billions to bail out flood victims. But with Hurricane Katrina, the program failed on both counts. Nearly half the victims did not even have flood insurance. Claims from homeowners who were insured, $25 billion worth, bankrupted the program. And the government has had to commit $15 billion in additional taxpayer money for rebuilding in Louisiana and Mississippi. Now, an effort to rescue the insurance program that grew in Hurricane Katrina's wake is faltering, too. Though experts foresee a generation of fiercer and more frequent storms, Congress seems unlikely to make more than modest changes when it takes up the program in the coming weeks. The drive to restructure the perennially underfinanced program has been blocked by real estate interests, who worry that requiring millions more people to buy flood insurance would stifle development, and by lawmakers from areas that rarely flood who see their constituents as supporting those who are frequently flooded, particularly in the South. ''You've got people living in dry areas paying for people who want to keep living in wet ones,'' said Representative Candice S. Miller, Republican of Michigan. ''They're sticking it to us, and I don't like to be stuck.'' The inability over decades to work out who pays the bill for flooding is at the heart of the weaknesses in the insurance program so blatantly laid bare by Hurricane Katrina. A close examination of the program shows how those same lobbying pressures and regional rivalries have helped create an insurance plan that has consistently defied the central rule of how to succeed in the insurance trade: have enough policyholders paying enough in premiums to spread out the risk and build a financial cushion against disaster. Since its beginning in the late 1960's, the flood program has struggled against a basic handicap: Most people, except those in the clearest path of danger, believe they do not need it. So, in an effort to make the insurance affordable and attractive to reluctant homeowners, the government has kept premiums artificially low -- typically $300 to $400 a year for coverage up to $250,000. At the same time, though, it has limited the size of the program's flood zones -- the only areas in which many people are required to buy the policies. A result, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, is an insurance plan in serious danger, groping for a politically palatable way to grow. Testifying before Congress this year, the flood program's acting director, David I. Maurstad, acknowledged that it faced ''numerous challenges on a variety of fronts.'' But insurance officials also say the program, which takes in only $2.2 billion in fees each year, was never meant to handle a devastating storm like Hurricane Katrina. Even so, many of the program's critics in Congress and elsewhere argue that it can and should be rebuilt as a stronger hedge against a less-catastrophic run of storms. ''It hasn't come close to its promise of insuring everyone who's in danger of being flooded, reducing the cost of disasters for the federal government or making sure the program ultimately pays its own way,'' said J. Robert Hunter, who once ran the program and is director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America. ''It's like a trip through the looking glass,'' he added. ''Everything is backwards.'' Asking Beneficiaries to Pay The idea of federal flood insurance began in the early 1950's with President Harry S. Truman, after big floods in his home state, Missouri. Private insurers would not provide the coverage, arguing that only those most likely to be flooded would buy it, and that an avalanche of claims would bring big financial losses. But what finally brought the idea to fruition nearly two decades later was a desire to do something about the rising cost of federal disaster relief. In particular, Congress felt it was important that the beneficiaries helped pay the bill. Under the program, the Federal Emergency Management Agency maps areas along coasts, lakes and rivers with significant flood risk -- a 1 percent chance of flooding in any year -- and tries to sell insurance to people in or near them. Though more than 4.8 million people have the policies, that includes only about half the households in the flood zones. To attract buyers, the government discounted the premiums, some to a fraction of what a private company would have charged. But initially, no one was required to buy flood insurance, and hardly anyone did. ''People would just say, 'It won't happen to me,' '' George K. Bernstein, the program's first administrator, said in an interview. Gilbert F. White, a retired professor whose research in the mid-1960's laid the foundation for the program, said the government originally considered larger flood zones but pulled back under pressure from homebuilders and real estate developers. The program also linked the availability of insurance to agreements by local governments to enact new building codes intended to reduce flood damage, mainly by raising houses above expected flood levels. But the real estate interests persuaded many communities to stay out of the program, Mr. Bernstein said. A Program Overwhelmed In the summer of 1972, Hurricane Agnes caused $400 million in flood damage along the Eastern Seaboard; only $5 million was covered by insurance. Soon after, Congress made the insurance mandatory for people in the flood zones with federally regulated mortgages. These measures let the program expand just enough to limp along. Over the years, it paid out almost $15 billion in claims, borrowing from the Treasury in bad years and paying the money back, with interest, in quieter times. But by early last year, the fund had slipped into the red again, drained by $2 billion in claims from the hurricanes in Florida in 2004. Then came Hurricane Katrina. Along the Mississippi coast, waves up to 30 feet high surged past the flood-zone boundaries. Federal figures show that two-thirds of the 46,000 flooded homes and apartments in Mississippi were outside the zones. One problem was the flood maps, which had not been updated in more than a decade and no longer reflected the true danger. In New Orleans, the program stumbled on another assumption: though experts had long warned that a terrible hurricane could top the levees and inundate the low-lying city, that possibility was never factored into the hazard calculations. Instead, the mapmakers focused solely on the impact of heavy rains. Luckily for New Orleans, which often floods in bad rains, the bulk of the city was in the flood zones. So 65 percent of the 54,000 flooded homeowners had at least some insurance. But a few areas that flooded badly from the levee breaks, like much of the Lower Ninth Ward, were outside the zones. Relatively few people there, or among the city's large population of renters, had insurance. And many others had only enough to cover their mortgages, leaving little cash to rebuild. Joy Fortune, a retired bank executive, and her 86-year-old mother, Hazel Castanel, had a $73,000 flood policy on their beige brick home. But after the house sat in six feet of water for two weeks, an adjuster estimated the damage at $124,000, leaving them $51,000 short. At first, it looked as if they would not be able to rebuild. But then the Bush administration and Congress came up with $15 billion in grants to make up for gaps in insurance. ''We want to go back,'' Ms. Fortune said. ''It's my home and it's our life.'' Even with the gaps, the program was swamped by $25 billion in claims from Hurricane Katrina and two other hurricanes last fall, and it will need to borrow all that money from the government to pay them. What is more, insurance officials say they doubt they will be able to pay much of it back, leaving taxpayers with the bill just as if there were no insurance program. It was with that huge bill in mind that two influential congressmen -- Michael G. Oxley, an Ohio Republican who heads the Financial Services Committee, and Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat -- drafted legislation that would have greatly expanded the flood zones to draw millions more homeowners into the program. The new zones would have encompassed areas considered only one-fifth as susceptible to flooding in any given year. 'A Unique Opportunity' Flood experts, consumer advocates, environmentalists and some insurance experts welcomed the move. But lobbyists for homebuilders, real estate agents and mortgage lenders cautioned lawmakers that the extra cost of flood insurance could hurt housing sales and slow the economy. The program ''may need a tune-up, but I don't think it needs radical change,'' David L. Pressly Jr., president of the National Association of Home Builders, said in an interview. In mid-November, a senior Republican on the Financial Services Committee, Richard H. Baker of Louisiana, proposed a compromise -- keeping the current flood zones but requiring coverage for everyone in those areas and in areas adjacent to levees, like those that flooded in New Orleans. But the committee narrowly adopted an amendment from Rep. Gary G. Miller, a Republican and a former homebuilder from California, which mandated a study of the situation while FEMA put together a clearer picture of the expanded zones. In a recent interview, Mr. Miller said he had no problem with requiring people in areas like New Orleans to buy the insurance, and perhaps having them pay more for it. But expanding the flood zones, he said, amounted to going to people in, say, Los Angeles and telling them: ''We need to raise revenue, so we're going to make you buy into a program that you really are never going to need and never benefit from anyway.'' The bill, which the House is expected to take up in the next two weeks, now calls for updating the nation's flood maps, increasing premiums, and reducing subsidies on small businesses and second homes. It would also raise the maximum coverage on a house to $337,000 from $250,000. In all, these changes could bring in perhaps $500 million more a year. Mr. Frank of Massachusetts said there was ''not as much improvement as we'd like, but it's the best we're able to get right now.'' Lobbyists and legislative aides said they expected no major strengthening of the legislation when the Senate takes it up in coming weeks. Around the country, opposition to expanding the program seems to be growing. In Michigan, Representative Miller said she was so angry about the program's inequities that she was considering urging that the state withdraw from it. People in her rarely flooded district, she said, had paid four times more in premiums than they had received in claims in the past 10 years. By contrast, even before Hurricane Katrina, homeowners in just three hurricane-prone states -- Florida, Louisiana and Texas -- had received nearly half the money paid by the program since 1978, federal figures show. Some experts say the program needs to shift from its ''one size fits all'' approach, which uses the same standards to set rates and the size of flood zones around the nation, to one that takes into account the degree of risk in each area, much as a private insurance plan would. But program officials say they do not believe they have enough history of claims in many areas to make reliable distinctions. Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group, said the shock of Hurricane Katrina had provided ''a unique opportunity for quantum reform'' of the flood program. But he said the steps now being contemplated ''will do relatively little to protect people who live in flood zones and to protect taxpayers around the country.'' Looming over the debate are the warnings from meteorologists. Christopher W. Landsea, science and operations officer at the National Hurricane Center, says warmer ocean temperatures and less disruptive wind currents could make the next two or three decades much more active for hurricanes. And scientists at Colorado State University recently predicted that there could be as many as five intense hurricanes this year. The chance of one striking the Gulf Coast is nearly 50 percent."
"This week's deluge in New England reminds us that the destructive force of floodwaters is hardly a danger exclusive to the Gulf Coast. Yet parochial interests undermine both the defenses our government erects to prevent flooding and the recovery assistance that is needed for when they fail. The Army Corps of Engineers must learn, or be compelled, to place a higher priority on safety projects than on Congressional pork. At the same time, the government should use its federal flood insurance to encourage safe building, not to subsidize irresponsible development. The corps changes the courses of rivers, dredges the depths of harbors and builds the walls that protect homes, but it gets its marching orders from members of Congress. They are often more interested in wasteful and unnecessary projects in their individual districts than in enhancing safety and acting responsibly toward the environment on behalf of the nation as a whole. Senators Russell Feingold and John McCain have sponsored a measure that would bring more accountability to the corps' multibillion-dollar construction budget; they hope to attach it as an amendment to the giant water-resources bill in Congress. Their plan would also require greater independent review of project designs to head off engineering failures like the ones that led to the breach in the New Orleans levees. While it wouldn't solve all of the corps' problems, it would shine more light on an often opaque process, a reform we support. Federal flood insurance is a necessary buffer for the people whose homes are ruined when disaster strikes. If the system is going to continue, following the $25 billion in claims the program racked up after Hurricane Katrina and a pair of less destructive storms, change is needed there, too. The government can start by excluding vacation homes from the subsidized rates. Levees are imperfect, and those living next to them should be required to buy the insurance. Right now, the rules assume that flood walls won't fail. Most of all, rules on new construction in vulnerable areas have to be enforced to ensure that we're not just building the next generation of endangered homes. Nature's storms seem to be getting fiercer as people are moving closer to harm's way, whether that's along the coast or behind flood walls. Hurricane Katrina made the risks abundantly clear, but our nation has yet to show it's learned the lesson. Editorial"
"Typhoon Kaemi came ashore on the southern China coast Tuesday afternoon, prompting the evacuation of more than 643,000 people in a region still recovering from an earlier storm that caused major flooding and left more than 600 people dead. State news media reported that the typhoon struck the coast at 3:50 p.m. in Fujian Province before being downgraded to a tropical storm. It was expected to dump rain along the coast and gradually move inland toward Anhui Province. It was the fifth major storm to hit the Chinese coast during this summer's typhoon season. Early Wednesday morning, heavy rains doused Fujian, as well as Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces, but it was too early to determine the extent of any damages. Government officials ordered a major mobilization before the storm, including the arrival of 3,000 officers of the People's Armed Police in Fujian to respond to emergencies. State news media reported that officials had sent text-message warnings about the storm to six million cellphone users in the region. In addition, more than 60,000 vessels were ordered to return to harbors. The efforts by the government followed a confused response to the tropical storm Bilis, which came ashore in southern China about two weeks ago and set off mudslides and flooding. Initially, officials attributed about 200 deaths to Bilis, but that figure more than doubled last week amid accusations that local officials had tried to hide the true number of deaths. The Ministry of Civil Affairs sent a special team to investigate the allegations of a cover-up. Local officials have denied a cover-up and blamed any confusion on communications breakdowns at the height of the crisis. In the interim, the death toll from Bilis has risen to 612, with another 208 people missing. On Saturday, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao visited Hunan Province, where at least 346 people died in floods and landslides from the storm. Summer is traditionally typhoon season in southern China, but meteorologists say the storms have arrived earlier this year. Earlier, Kaemi swept across the Philippines before hitting Taiwan on Monday night. State news media reported that the storm had caused major disruptions on Taiwan but only limited property damage and four injuries."
"Six weeks before Hurricane Katrina tore up the Gulf Coast of Mississippi last August, Dr. Munson Hinman went to see his insurance agent to buy flood coverage for his home near the beach. He had a blank check in his pocket, but, Dr. Hinman testified in Federal District Court here on Tuesday, the agent talked him out of buying the coverage. ''He didn't tell me directly not to get it,'' Dr. Hinman recalled. ''But in a roundabout way he said it wasn't necessary. He was emphatic about that it wasn't necessary.'' Dr. Hinman, a chiropractor, was testifying in a lawsuit against Nationwide Insurance that could force the Ohio company and other insurers to pay out billions of dollars for claims of flood damage from Hurricane Katrina and other storms that they have previously denied. Mr. Hinman's home was heavily damaged in the hurricane. The insurers have said their policies specifically rule out coverage for floods. But Richard F. Scruggs, a Pascagoula lawyer who rose to prominence as he helped win a $250 billion settlement from the tobacco industry a few years ago, argues that in selling home insurance with many references to windstorms and hurricanes, Nationwide and other insurers led customers to believe that any hurricane damage -- whether from wind or water -- would be covered. That perception was reinforced, Mr. Scruggs said in an interview, by agents who suggested to customers like Dr. Hinman that they did not need to buy the separate coverage for flood damage that is provided by the federal government and sold through agents. ''They thought they had all they needed,'' Mr. Scruggs said. Representing Nationwide, Daniel F. Attridge, a lawyer for the Chicago firm of Kirkland & Ellis, argued in court that the company's home insurance policy was unambiguous in its exclusion of flood damage. For wind damage alone from Hurricane Katrina, the insurers are paying more than $30 billion and the federal government expects to pay another $25 billion to those homeowners in the region who bought separate flood insurance policies. Katrina is already the most costly hurricane ever. But tens of thousands of residents who lost their homes have been left without money to rebuild because the insurers say most of the storm damage came from flooding rather than high winds. Many homeowners are applying for federal grants. The lawsuit against Nationwide is unfolding before Federal Judge L. T. Senter Jr. of the Southern District of Mississippi in a city still crippled from the storm. Its downtown is filled with patched-up buildings, many of them empty. Many streetlights and phones are still not working. Piles of rubble rise two stories high along some side streets. The new concrete and glass federal courthouse was also damaged by the hurricane and has yet to reopen fully. Many homeowners have complained that they received less than they expected for wind damage because they were told by their insurers that they were entitled to receive payments only for damage to roofs and other parts of their house above the highest water stains on their walls. Mr. Scruggs addressed that issue on Wednesday by leading a private meteorologist, Rocco Calaci, through a detailed accounting of the movement of wind and waves along the Mississippi on Aug. 29, 2005, as Hurricane Katrina struck. According to Mr. Calaci's testimony, hurricane-force winds battered the coast for hours before water rushed over the land, knocking down houses and trees. High winds, he said, continued for several more hours after the water had receded. Several people who rode out the storm in their homes testified earlier that, in their neighborhoods near the Alabama border, the water rose slowly and gradually to more than five feet in their homes. That was in contrast to the sudden surge of water, three stories high, that smashed across the beach around Bay St. Louis and Waveland to the west, at the Louisiana border. But all along the Mississippi coast, residents say, their homes suffered heavy wind damage long before the water began to rise. Testimony in the trial began Monday and may continue into next week. By agreement of both parties, Judge Senter is serving as judge and jury. The lawsuit pits Nationwide against a couple from Pascagoula, Paul Leonard, a police lieutenant, and his wife, Julie, who runs a child care business. They estimated their modest two-story house suffered $130,000 in damage that Nationwide says was mostly from floodwater. The Leonards' lawyers estimate that $72,000 of the damage came from wind. But they say the insurance company is obliged to pay the whole $130,000. The Leonards' lost another $28,000 in furnishings and clothing, they said. The insurance company has so far paid them $1,600 to account for the loss of a few roof shingles and at least one broken window. The Leonards' lawsuit is the first to go trial in a dispute that may eventually involve thousands of plaintiffs and dozens of lawyers. Mr. Scruggs -- who is arguing the case with his son Zach; a colleague from northern Mississippi, Don Barrett; and John Jones from Jackson, Miss. -- said he had already filed suit on behalf of about 2,000 clients seeking redress from their insurers, including Senator Trent Lott, who is both a neighbor of Mr. Scruggs in Pascagoula and his brother-in-law; and Representative Gene Taylor of Bay St. Louis. Many of those attending the trial are lawyers for other clients and they are taking detailed notes. Mr. Scruggs, whose waterfront home was heavily damaged by Katrina, said he chose to pursue the claims individually or, perhaps eventually in groups, rather than as a class action mainly because it could take years to receive court certification for a class action. ''Time is of essence,'' Mr. Scruggs said in the interview. ''These people need the insurance money to rebuild.'' Dr. Hinman, who lives near Mr. Leonard, testified that he received nearly $137,000 from Nationwide shortly before the trial. Joe Case, a spokesman for Nationwide, said the company decided to resolve Dr. Hinman's complaint that he had been misled by adjusting his claim as if he had bought flood insurance. But Mr. Case said the company continued to dispute that others had been treated unfairly. Testifying as the first witness on Monday, Mr. Leonard said he asked his Nationwide agent, Jay Fletcher, whether he needed flood insurance shortly after Hurricane Georges in 1998. ''He told me I didn't need it,'' Mr. Leonard told the court. The two men did not discuss the issue again, and part of Nationwide's defense in the lawsuit is that the statute of limitations has run out for Mr. Leonard. In an interview, Mr. Scruggs said that advice provided by the insurance agent, who is not a defendant in the lawsuit, amounted to an expansion of the home insurance contract, and signaled to Mr. Leonard and other customers that nothing more than the homeowners' policy was needed for hurricane protection. Mr. Attridge, the lawyer representing Nationwide, said Mr. Fletcher was not authorized to expand the coverage, and Mr. Fletcher never explicitly told clients that their policies would protect them from hurricane flooding. Lawyers for Nationwide also acknowledged that Mr. Fletcher himself had not bought flood insurance. By the time of Katrina, the lawyers said, Mr. Fletcher had sold flood insurance to 180 of his 1,200 Nationwide home insurance customers. Along the Mississippi coast, fewer than 20 percent of all homeowners bought flood insurance and many now say they thought their home insurance policies would cover any kind of hurricane damage. Mr. Case, the spokesman for Nationwide, said the lawyers for hurricane victims were ''trying to muddy the waters with a great deal of information.'' He added, ''We hope the court will find Nationwide acted appropriately.''"
"Trees caked with mud choke the Third Brook Bridge. Chest-high piles -- rotting floorboards, shelves and shoes -- line the grimy sidewalks. The McDonald's and the farm equipment shop are gutted, and every passing car kicks up dust from the drying mud the river left behind. Walton has not looked this good in a week. This town of about 5,000 near the Catskills is crossed by a branch of the Delaware River and a half-dozen creeks. On the way into town, yellow road signs warning of tractors and cows up ahead attest to its rural character. Many of the homes are set on steep hills, but its downtown sits in a valley, the lowest, flattest stretch of land around. When the floodwaters that ravaged parts of the Northeast roared through here last week, downtown Walton and hundreds of its homes did not stand a chance. Debris choked each of the town's eight bridges. The sludgy water, unable to go elsewhere, rushed through the streets, buckling asphalt and carving craters. Nearly every downtown business, except for two gas stations built on knolls, was engulfed by a river of mud, a sludgy, noxious soup five feet deep. The ground beneath T. A.'s diner washed out, leaving the place listing toward a creek. The first floor of Tony's Shoes became a mausoleum of Hush Puppies, moccasins and penny loafers. The Ford dealership lost cars, the 10-lane bowling alley's gutters were ruined, and the Kraft Foods factory, which employs 260 people, lost $1.2 million in cottage cheese and sour cream, according to Edward H. Snow Sr., Walton's mayor. But the residents of Walton, with help from the National Guard and firefighters from 80 departments around the state and Canada, are working to restoring the town. So far, 40 uprooted trees have been tugged free of the main bridge. Dozens of entombed cars have been dug out of mud banks, and 800 basements pumped out. Walton being a small town, elements of its recovery are decidedly unusual. Neighbors baked casseroles for one another. They let strangers use their showers. Wilma Hannan, the owner of Danny's Restaurant and Lounge, put up a dozen firefighters from Long Island. Dorrie Buttel rescued two horses after her neighbor's pasture went under water. They're in a grassy enclosure now behind the Walton Motel, which she owns. The Sunoco station has become the town's hotspot, most likely because it has a delicatessen outfitted with orange booths and a soft ice cream machine. At night, dirt-splattered, steely-eyed men sit on picnic benches out front, draining cans of beer by the Sunoco sign's light. They break up at 9 p.m., when the town's emergency curfew kicks in. ''Sunoco is the heartbeat of Walton now,'' said Ms. Buttel. ''It's like 'Northern Exposure' here.'' The flooding came at a terrible time for Walton. It had seemed to be on the verge of recovery, a reversal of the loss of people, money and businesses typical of a declining small town. ''We had started to turn around,'' said Norma Cucciarre, whose husband owns Tony's Shoes. ''The beautification committee just put big pots of petunias all down the street. They went bob-bob-bobbing to the Delaware.'' Wealthy out-of-towners were starting to choose Walton for their second homes. Developers were planning condominiums and townhouses, Mr. Snow said. A new hardware store had opened. A General Dollar store was halfway built. James Groff, owner of Big M, the only supermarket in town, took out a $750,000 loan to expand the store by 5,000 square feet, and the grand reopening was June 10. Mr. Groff and his workers returned to find thick mud had smothered the bottom four shelves throughout the store. Seven cash registers and a prized new $27,000 chicken rotisserie were lost, said the Big M manager, Glenn Mattice. Thirty-five truckloads of ruined groceries had to be dumped in a landfill, a $250,000 loss. ''We had just stocked up for July 4th,'' Mr. Mattice said, his eyes reddening. Walton has weathered disasters before. The town was flooded in 1935 and again after a big snow melt early in 1996. But the scope of this flood was unprecedented. Houses, few with flood insurance, were rocked off their foundations. From 30 to 50 businesses are shut down, Mr. Snow said. He has estimated a $20 million to $30 million loss, and is hoping for state and federal aid to help rebuild the town. ''Most business owners can't take out loans; they're already maxed out,'' Mr. Snow said. ''All these places need grants.'' There is one place, however, where the salvage effort is looking good. For five days, Frank Cucciarre's children and grandchildren took what they could from his shop, Tony's Shoes. Hundreds of shoes were laid along the sidewalk and hosed off. The family has filled two 50-foot trailers with salvaged plastic footwear and work boots, and plans to donate what they cannot sell. The challenge now, Mr. Cucciarre said wryly, will be finding every shoe's mate."
"It has survived the Great Pumpkin Flood of 1903, a fire in the early 1930's and, perhaps most significantly of all, almost 160 years. Last week, not even the floods that tore a wide, costly swath of destruction along the Susquehanna and Delaware Rivers could tear down this one simple old thing. A bridge. The bridge that spans the Upper Delaware River, connecting Minisink Ford, N.Y., with Lackawaxen, Pa., is not just any bridge. It is the Sullivan County sister of the famed Brooklyn Bridge and was designed by John A. Roebling, the Brooklyn Bridge's architect. Completed in 1848, the Delaware Aqueduct, known commonly as the Roebling Bridge, is the oldest wire-cable suspension bridge in America. Last week's floods washed away homes, businesses, cars, cows, trees and, tragically, a wide span of Interstate 88 near Binghamton, N.Y., and the two truckers driving along it. A number of bridges in New York and Pennsylvania were destroyed. But Sunday, John Conway, the Sullivan County historian, walked along the Roebling Bridge's wooden towpath. There had been a rumor on the first day of the floods that the bridge had collapsed, but Mr. Conway did not believe it, even though his own home, about four miles away, had seven feet of water in its basement. ''The bridge has been through a lot,'' said Mr. Conway, 53, as the muddy waters flowed underneath. During the flooding, the Upper Delaware River rose nearly to the bottom of the span. Sunday, though, instead of carrying debris, the river carried rafters, cheering, in a sign that life had started to return to some normalcy. ''I wouldn't say it's indestructible, but it survived for 160 years,'' Mr. Conway said. Here in the green hills of upstate New York, the land of the firefly, the deer crossing and the silent night, old bridges are as vital to transportation as the subways are to New York City. Tourist attractions for some, taken for granted by others, last week they served as a kind of test of man versus nature, of how bad a flood can get and how strong a bridge can be. About 48 bridges under the jurisdiction of New York State's Department of Transportation were damaged, a spokeswoman said. Four were completely washed away. As crews inspected the toll, there was no way to know precisely why some of the bridges failed but others did not, why the waters left this one unscathed and that one a memory. In Delaware County, six bridges were seriously damaged or destroyed, said Phil Pierce, the county's deputy commissioner of public works. He said the number would increase as officials continued to assess the county's 270 bridges. ''Most of the problems we've had relate to the debris that was washed onto the bridges and onto the roads that lead to the bridges, which has prevented us in some cases from getting to the bridge,'' Mr. Pierce said. The county's two-lane Peakes Brook Bridge on Route 10 was swept away, cutting off the main artery into the Village of Walton. The village was a scene of soggy misery Sunday. ''We're going to change the name to Mudville,'' said Keath Davis, owner of Breakey Motors, a Ford dealership left with no cars, but a large sinkhole and jagged asphalt in the lot. ''A couple of my cars were washed all the way down to the fairgrounds.'' With most floodwaters having receded, thousands of residents of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania were cleaning mud from their basements and throwing away furniture Sunday. Some were still not permitted back home. The Federal Emergency Management Agency was still determining the damage, but the government did not add any counties to its list of disaster areas eligible for federal aid. So far, eight New York counties and four in Pennsylvania have been declared disaster areas. On the border between New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the bridges that span the Delaware River appeared to have weathered the storm. All but one of the 20 bridges were open Sunday. ''The water didn't top any of our bridges,'' said Kelley Heck, a spokeswoman for the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission. ''It came at about two or three feet of the deck of our lowest-lying bridges, so I guess we can breathe a sigh of relief.'' Meanwhile, the Roebling Bridge has been closed to traffic indefinitely until it can be inspected. But pedestrians were allowed on the towpaths that sit above the one-lane road Sunday, and they walked casually onto the bridge, a country version of the Sunday-afternoon strolls people were taking 90 miles away on Mr. Roebling's other, more famous, bridge. The Roebling Bridge, which was built as an aqueduct for the Delaware and Hudson Canal, was bought by the National Park Service in 1980. The price was $75,000, not that much more than its original cost, $41,750. The Park Service repaired the bridge, reconstructing the roadway and restoring the wrought-iron cables, each containing 2,150 wires. ''The Roebling Bridge is a grand old lady,'' said Carla Hahn, who works in the Park Service's Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River office. ''She's taken a lot of abuse from a lot of floods for a lot of years. She made it through and she's still standing.''"
"In a market spurred by speculators and bargain hunters, an extraordinarily large number of houses in the flood-ravaged metropolitan area here are being sold, according to real estate analysts, who say volume and sales prices exceed levels before Hurricane Katrina. The higher prices are largely due to an increase in value in suburban areas, many of which were not heavily flooded, or in dry areas of New Orleans. But flooded houses in the city are being bought as well, often at deep discounts of as much as $50 a square foot less than they would have sold for before the hurricane. ''We have a stronger housing market than before,'' said Wade R. Ragas, professor emeritus of finance at the University of New Orleans and the president of a local consulting firm, Real Property Associates. ''There is renovation activity in every ZIP code of Orleans Parish,'' Dr. Ragas added, ''but the strongest buying activity is, in general, closest to where it did not flood or where there was under two feet of water.'' Across the nine-parish region that includes New Orleans, 7,506 single-family homes were sold between January and the end of last month, compared with 6,449 in the same period last year, according to statistics from the New Orleans Metropolitan Association of Realtors and the Gulf South Real Estate Information Network. The average price so far this year is $221,244, compared with $193,097 in the same period last year. The interest in buying, selling and renovating has been a bright spot since the last months of 2005, and has confounded some people who thought the flooding would cripple the housing market for years. But it is just one of many counterintuitive contrasts that are defining the area and making easy predictions unreliable. Before the storm, Jennifer and Rodney Greenup lived in the Gentilly neighborhood of New Orleans, in a 1950's-era, 2,600-square-foot house with a red tile roof that they bought nine years ago for $108,000. It was appraised for nearly $240,000 before Hurricane Katrina. But after the storm, when the levees broke, Gentilly was inundated, and the house sat in deep, murky water for weeks. It sold after just two weeks on the market in February for $110,000. The house had been gutted and still lacks walls, floors, appliances and other standard fixtures. ''We didn't think we'd be able to get anything remotely normal when we decided to sell it,'' said Ms. Greenup, a pharmacist. ''We just wanted to do all right and would have been happy to get 80 grand.'' The buyer was a firefighter who said he had admired the house for years and planned to fix it up and live in it. Kim and Reginald Glass are among the local investors betting on flood-ruined areas like Gentilly, which was a solidly middle-class neighborhood north of downtown toward Lake Pontchartrain. They have bought eight damaged houses for prices from $50,000 to $112,000, which Ms. Glass says probably represents about half the houses' market value before the storm. ''We had too much invested in New Orleans to walk away,'' said Ms. Glass, a lawyer who grew up in Gentilly. ''We needed to figure out a way to stay here and make a living. So we decided to purchase properties in Gentilly. We looked to purchase any property that had potential, in hope of being able to renovate and rent. I think we're going to try the rental market, because there are so many people looking to come back.'' The home the Glass family lived in had flood damage, and a house they were building on the lakeshore suffered wind damage. Undaunted, they returned to the city as early as possible, in October, and got to work. ''The biggest problem has been getting things like cabinets and appliances in,'' Ms. Glass said. ''It's been quite an experience. But we knew that we were coming back to fight.'' For-sale signs are everywhere, even in neighborhoods that feel dead, in this city of contrasts.. Some flood-ruined areas are still foul-smelling and dirty, while other neighborhoods are vibrant and clean. Some areas still have looting and other crimes, while many neighborhoods are generally safe, and tourists roam the French Quarter with drinks in hand. Though billions of dollars in federal housing aid will begin pouring into the city this fall, there is no clear vision for renovating vast parts of the area, and some experts say speculators are taking a significant risk. In addition, there has been a 20 percent increase in the cost of construction materials, and the city continues to have a shortage of workers, experts say. ''We don't know how things will pan out,'' said Ivan J. Miestchovich Jr., director of the Real Estate Market Data Center and the Center for Economic Development, both at the University of New Orleans. ''There's a readjustment period right now. I think there's still a big question mark.'' Amy Liu, deputy director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution in Washington, which is studying the post-storm recovery, said she was stunned by the number of houses on the market, but like Dr. Miestchovich was not sure what to make of it. ''What it means to us is that people are finally making decisions,'' Ms. Liu said. ''If people are choosing to leave, that could be a bad thing. But if inventory is moving, then that's a good thing. To us, this is part of the natural churning that has to happen.'' If much of the movement is being driven by speculators, that is not necessarily bad either, Ms. Liu said. ''If there are folks who are not financially able to clean up their homes,'' she said, ''it is much better to have someone buy it than have it be abandoned and foreclosed.'' Some sectors of the economy, of course, depend on optimism to survive, particularly real estate. Dee Luscy, president of the New Orleans Metropolitan Association of Realtors, said she thought the fear about the future was beginning to lift around the region. ''I think in the beginning people were afraid,'' Ms. Luscy said. ''A lot of people thought, 'We'll never be able to give this stuff away.' Now we're seeing that things are selling. I think people are over the initial shock and are starting to feel O.K. about going on with life. What happened was like death. You go through stages of grief.'' Vicki Shreves sold her gutted, 1,600-square-foot house in the Uptown section of New Orleans without putting up a for-sale sign. A friend of the family visited the house, on a street that had eight feet of water, ''and wanted to know if we wanted to sell it,'' Ms. Shreves said. ''It just seemed like such an easy thing, we said fine.'' To Ms. Shreves, an accountant, the thought of rebuilding was depressing, and mold was a concern. But she had not decided to sell when she and her husband got the offer, which was close to $100 a square foot. Before the storm, she said, she probably could have sold the house for $330,000. ''When the storm came and obliterated it,'' she said, ''we were happy to get $150,000.'' ''We got a check right there and closed the sale,'' she added. Beth Amadon bought a flooded house in a neighborhood near Lake Pontchartrain for about 50 percent of its prestorm value of more than $600,000. Ms. Amadon knows what the houses are worth because she put in an offer on a different house in the same neighborhood just days before Hurricane Katrina. ''After the storm we couldn't get back to the city, so we agreed to walk away from that sale,'' she said. ''That's how we ended up buying a different house.'' In addition, Ms. Amadon sold several distressed properties that she and her husband, a real estate developer, had owned in the Tremé area near the French Quarter for about 20 percent more than they would have expected before the hurricane. The buyer was a resident who said he intended to rent the houses. ''People seem anxious to buy historically relevant houses close to the French Quarter,'' Ms. Amadon said. ''It's been an interesting year.'' Joan Farabaugh, a real estate agent in New Orleans, said she had earned as much income in the past six months as she did in all of last year. ''And I have as much business with nonflooded as flooded'' houses, Ms. Farabaugh said. ''Most of my sales are people who are locals, buying and fixing up.'' She said she believed that her clients had faith in the future. ''They feel that what happened was unusual, and they don't feel that this will happen again,'' she said of the levee breaches and catastrophic flooding. ''They feel they will be fine.''"
"AFTER the recent heavy rains caused significant flooding along the East Coast, many homeowners may find themselves dealing with damp, soggy homes and furnishings. ''The most important thing to consider before going into a house after a flood is safety,'' said Ed Weingartner, the chief executive of Dynamic Restoration, a disaster-recovery company in West Chester, Pa. ''If you had a significant amount of water in the basement, either call the power company and tell them to disconnect the service, or ask an electrician to check to make sure it's safe.'' He said that since furnaces and some water heaters are connected to the electrical system, stepping into standing water in the same area could be dangerous. In addition, he said, homeowners should be aware that if flood water comes from a river, it could contain sewage. ''Bacterial content isn't necessarily an issue, but it could be,'' Mr. Weingartner said. Surfaces can be disinfected with a solution of one part bleach to nine parts water. Once a flood has subsided, Mr. Weingartner said, the house must be dried out as quickly as possible. ''Mold will start to grow within 48 to 72 hours,'' he said. Carpets, pads and furniture that were submerged should be removed, and drywall that was soaked should be cut out and discarded. Jeffrey Gross, a regional manager for Maxons Restorations in Manhattan, said there are three methods for drying out a wet house. The most basic, he said, is to get air circulating through it by using fans. Another method that is faster and more effective, but more expensive, is to use dehumidifiers. ''Dehumidifiers are used to remove deep imbedded moisture,'' he said. ''If you have a wood floor, or if the framing in the walls has been saturated, a dehumidifier will pull the moisture out of the wood.'' And while it is helpful to leave windows and doors open when using fans to dry out a building, they should be kept closed when using a dehumidifier. ''If humid outdoor air is allowed to enter the home, the dehumidifier will be fighting against the relative humidity outside,'' Mr. Gross said. He added that a dehumidifier in a closed room can reduce the relative humidity to a low of 20 percent. ''When the air is that dry,'' he said, ''it will wick moisture out of the walls and floors.'' Another way to dry out a house is to use the heating system along with the central air-conditioning system or window units. ''Warm air will hold more moisture than cooler air,'' Mr. Gross said. So a homeowner can close all doors and windows and run the air-conditioning. Once the house has cooled and the air is dry, the air-conditioning should be turned off and the heat turned on. When the temperature has reached, say, 80 degrees or so, the heat should be turned off and the air-conditioning turned back on until all the warm air has been removed. The cycle should be repeated until the house is dry. Mr. Gross said that homeowners who use this strategy must monitor the process closely. ''If you leave the heat on too long, you're basically turning your home into a greenhouse,'' he said. Dr. Philip R. Morey, a spokesman for the American Industrial Hygiene Association in Fairfax, Va., said that if a house is not dried out quickly enough and mold begins to grow, the owner should take steps to eliminate it. ''You need to physically remove the mold by scrubbing it off,'' he said. ''You can use a strong detergent, and a little bleach wouldn't hurt, and make sure to wear gloves and an N95 respirator.'' Such a respirator, he said, will filter out 95 percent of the mold spores and similar-size particles. Additional information about mold is available on the association's Web site at www.aiha.org.

"No one here was interested in buying plush Jerry Garcia dolls on Friday, or the beaded saris down on Main Street, or the wasp-waisted satin corsets that glowed like jewels from deep inside the darkened, sandbagged Grownups lingerie store. Motorcycles weren't roaring down Bridge Street. Grizzled bikers weren't filling their leather-encased bellies with beer at the Havana restaurant. Visitors weren't drifting into the Majik Horse curio shop, a place that announces itself with a sign: ''Hippie Parking Only. Violators will be drafted.'' It was a perfect day, sunny and breezy with wispy clouds floating by. Weather like this, at the start of a holiday weekend to boot, would usually draw tourists by the thousands to New Hope's winding, boutique-lined streets. But the Delaware River doesn't normally leap its banks, or invade riverfront shops and homes, or fill basements with muddy water that grows increasingly fetid. On Friday, the only people allowed in downtown New Hope were those entrusted with bailing it out. Workers filled wheelbarrows with shovelfuls of mud. Firemen worked in reverse, snaking hoses into submerged basements, sucking out hundreds of gallons of muddy floodwater. Red Cross workers cruised the streets with red Radio Flyer wagons, dispensing bottled water, Famous Amos cookies and turkey sandwiches. This little waterfront borough has a population of 2,252. Charm is its commodity, tourism its lifeblood. From the moment the news hit that floodwaters were coming, shopowners along the waterfront main street raced to prevent as much damage as they could. As in many parts of the Northeast, this was New Hope's third flooding in 18 months. Most shopkeepers were prepared. Melissa Manzi's ice cream parlor, the Last Temptation, was outfitted with a generator so not one scoopful of rainbow sherbet was lost. Every melty mint and solid milk kitty in Phyllis Foster's Country Fair Chocolate store was saved by generators, too. Michael McManus, a lanky and long-haired shop owner who wears a dagger and scabbard around his neck, managed to get every piece of medieval clothing and ''Lord of the Rings'' collectible out of his boutique ahead of the flood. ''Things go in cycles,'' Mr. McManus said with a shrug. ''Mother Nature's a lot older than mankind.'' But not everyone won the race against time. Ralph Miller, owner of the Bucks County Playhouse, saw 30 years' worth of backdrops, props, costumes and sets lost to the Delaware's ruthless waters. The playhouse production of ''Miss Saigon'' was scheduled to open on June 28, the night the townspeople first learned that floodwaters were on their way. Mr. Miller enlisted his actors, stagehands and friends to save what they could. They dragged almost everything needed for this summer's performances from the playhouse's vast basement to its stage. Everything else was lost, including a hundred-thousand-dollar lighting system, Mr. Miller said. ''Can you get everything out of there in 12 hours?'' Mr. Miller asked, shouting above the roar of generator-powered water pumps. ''We didn't. But we tried.'' Downtown's misfortunes had a ripple effect around New Hope simply because of the interconnectedness of the place. The configurations of the electricity grid meant that many unscathed stores had no power. Electricity could not be turned back on until inspectors checked out every fuse box. For that to happen, waters had to fully recede. Laurence D. Keller, New Hope's mayor, said he hoped that 90 percent of the village's businesses would have power back by Sunday. As of Friday morning, he said, one-fourth of residences and one-half the shops and businesses were without electricity. Up the hill from downtown, Gregory Conocchioli chose to open his gourmet grocery for the day. The place was bone dry. It still had power. ''I want people to know businesses up here are up and running, that the community's going to survive,'' Mr. Conocchioli said. But his decision to open was largely symbolic. Access to his store was prevented by police tape and by a police officer, stationed at the hilltop in a patrol car. Yet as the day progressed, more and more streets reopened. Pumps appeared everywhere, working overtime to drain basements and return unwelcome water to the Delaware, still engorged but fast receding. Business owners turned their attention to another form of damage control. They began stalking reporters on the streets, imploring them to spread the news that the disaster-struck borough would be back on its feet in days. ''We're going to have the electric on soon, the public works on,'' said Geri Delevich, a borough councilwomen, fixing a reporter with a stern stare. ''We're hoping to salvage the remainder of the Fourth of July.''"
"It will not give people an excuse for delaying any tax payments, but the Internal Revenue Service said Friday that flooding brought on by the heavy rains here this week would force it to keep its headquarters building closed for perhaps the next month. And the National Archives, which stores the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, will keep its main building shut until Wednesday at the earliest, as will the Justice Department. The deluge lasted nearly four days and caused damage totaling tens of millions of dollars to homes and businesses in the capital, Maryland and Virginia. Several people drowned in the floodwaters, and more than 2,000 were evacuated from their homes in Montgomery County, Md., just north of Washington. A few inches of standing water still cover parts of the I.R.S.'s main building, which the agency said would stay closed for up to 30 days to allow repairs to infrastructure and computer and electrical systems. Some 2,400 employees, including Commissioner Mark W. Everson, will be relocated to about a dozen other I.R.S. offices in the Washington area or to temporary workplaces, the agency said. Still others will work from home. The headquarters does not process tax claims. It does house tax lawyers, law enforcement agents and administrative staff along with senior officials, but Terry L. Lemons, a spokesman for the agency, said the cleanup would not disrupt tax administration or any enforcement efforts. ''Our agency is a decentralized one,'' Mr. Lemons said. ''To the average taxpayer, the building being closed will be completely invisible.'' The National Archives, meanwhile, lost power in its building on Sunday night after basement levels were flooded by several feet of water. Susan Cooper, a spokeswoman for the archives, noted that the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence were all kept in protective cases and said all had escaped damage. As for the Justice Department, fewer than 2 percent of its 120,000 employees work at headquarters, on Pennsylvania Avenue, Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales said in a statement. For the time being, they will work from ''designated alternate locations,'' Mr. Gonzales said."
"The tetherball hung motionless at Camp Watonka. The waterlogged tennis nets lay crumpled on the court. Instead of the exuberant cries of young boys, the air filled with the buzzing of mosquitoes and the low rumble of a small backhoe spreading gravel over the mud, a fresh reminder of the days of torrential rain. Most of the campers were hunkered down in the recreation room of a church a few miles away, drowsily watching ''X-Men'' and playing video games. ''The first camping trip of the season,'' said Neil Corbett, the camp's genial, British-born head program director. ''That's how we sold it.'' All across the Poconos this week, camp directors were putting on their happy faces and galoshes as the rains and floods that worked their rough will along the Susquehanna and Delaware Rivers interrupted the annual camp season, which draws thousands of children from New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey to this major center of sleepaway camps. As the skies cleared and the floodwaters retreated on Friday, the reports began to trickle in. At Camp Tel Yehuda, on the Delaware in Barryville, N.Y., the campers were sent to a nearby shelter. Camp Weequahic, like many in the region, had to delay its opening. Camp Ramah, tucked in the northeast corner of Pensylvania, found itself briefly cut off from the outside world when rain washed out the dirt roads leading to its gates. ''People came up with a lot of out-of-the-box activities,'' said Rabbi Todd Zeff, the camp's director. ''Instead of swimming, we taught the American Red Cross CPR course. In woodworking, they tried to build a little ark.'' Adaptation was the order of the day. ''We brought with us our whole operation,'' said Meir Housman, 36, the director of Camp Tel Yehuda, briefly relocated at a high school in Eldred, N.Y., which was rechristened ''T-Y High'' for the occasion. ''We were going to put on a play in camp, so we put on the play in the auditorium instead.'' The campers themselves were safe and in good spirits, Mr. Housman said, although the flooding destroyed at least one building at the camp. ''We're right on the river,'' he said. ''So we get both -- the beautiful view and the floods.'' Others reported a little water logging, but nothing severe. Several posted cheerful notes and upbeat pictures on their Web sites, seemingly to forestall parental concern. ''As you can see from all the smiling faces on the Web, we are having a great time at camp, and the rainy weather has finally subsided,'' read a message from Camp Equinunk, in Equinunk, Penn. Camp Watonka, a science camp where boys 7 to 15 huddle around Bunsen burners and campfires alike, came out better than some. ''It could have been worse,'' said Don Wacker, the taciturn, weathered former science teacher who founded Watonka with his wife in 1963. The rain began falling in earnest last weekend, he said, just after the campers began arriving for the summer. By Tuesday, they decided to move the campers here in Hawley, ''just for safety.'' So it was that several dozen boys found themselves in church -- on a weekday. ''My camp is underwater!'' shouted Mason, a 10-year-old camper from Philadelphia. He and several friends were engrossed in their third game of Monopoly, collecting rents with the avidity of a young Donald Trump. Nearby, a few teenage campers were playing portable video games. Biology and chemistry would have to wait. ''This is the craziest thing that's ever happened,'' said Derek, 15, a camper from Virginia Beach, who was in his eighth year at Watonka. ''We almost got flooded two years ago. But we didn't have to evacuate.'' He pronounced the last word with something approaching glee. A pastor volunteered the church as shelter, and some residents provided freezer trucks to transport food, so the campers got to eat the same meals they would have had at Watonka. Mr. Corbett and his fellow counselors plotted to keep their charges busy, scheduling trips to a roller rink and Dorney Park, the theme park in nearby Allentown, which, he said, the campers pretty much had to themselves. ''It's an all-boys camp, so that makes it easier,'' Mr. Corbett said, surveying the remains of dinner. ''We get them tired out, show movies and put them to bed. Wake up, repeat.'' The boys appeared to appreciate the procedure. A few admitted -- in voices quiet enough so that not too many others would hear -- to being just a little afraid, at least while the rain was coming down. Joe, a 15-year-old who came to Watonka for rocketry and riflery, confessed to being mildly bored, though he perked up regarding the trip to the roller rink. Others suggested a few unexpected results. ''Sleeping late!'' one camper said. ''Getting to sleep next to someone who hasn't showered in two days,'' another said. (Showers came Thursday, at a high school.) ''Getting official refugee status from the Red Cross,'' another said. ''That was cool.'' At the end of the dirt road leading to Watonka, a ''Road Closed'' sign was propped up on a wooden barricade. A cherrypicker stood near the camp's front gate, and acres of soggy shorts and T-shirts were hung out to dry on seemingly every porch railing, bench and roof in sight. A puddle roughly the size of an Olympic swimming pool had gathered on the camp's front field. ''We're doing fine,'' one counselor said as she rushed by, her expression suggesting otherwise. But the sun was out, and the groundwater pumps were humming. Mr. Wacker patrolled the grounds with two dogs, while his counselors and a few older campers made minor repairs and checked the food supplies, getting ready for the campers' return. ''This isn't such a challenge,'' he said. ''Now finding good camp staffers -- that's hard.''"
"Not long after the roiling waters of the Delaware River and the creeks that thread this mountain town began to recede, the town's supervisor, Samuel Rowe Jr., began to tally the losses from this week's powerful flooding. The computers and paper records at the town hall were destroyed. At the Highway Department's garage nearby, the flood engulfed and destroyed two pavement rollers, two all-wheel-drive dump trucks and a single-axle truck, with a total value of $500,000. And that was just the beginning. Wedged in a network of valleys on the edge of the Catskills, the Town of Hancock has stood largely isolated since the flooding began three days ago. Many of its roads were buried in debris or simply washed away. Police kept people out by setting up roadblocks on the main access routes. Three days after the flooding began, dozens of residents remained trapped at their homes as rescue crews in all-terrain vehicles and on foot headed into the mountains for hard-to-reach riverside hamlets, carrying medicine and supplies to the stranded. ''We're talking months to get over the brunt of this flood, for sure, but we're trying to push to get some basic infrastructure in place so we can begin to take care of our people,'' Mr. Rowe said. ''Then, we'll figure out what we need to get our town back the way it was.'' It is too early to tell how much the cleanup and repairs will cost, or even how much public money will be made available to this and other riverside communities. On Friday, Governors George E. Pataki of New York, Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey and Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania asked President Bush for disaster declarations to make their states eligible for federal assistance. The flooding has been blamed for at least 16 deaths in four states, according to The Associated Press, and as many as 9,000 people had still not been allowed to return to their homes in New York and New Jersey as of Friday night. Governor Pataki, touring upstate, called the flooding ''unprecedented'' and the damage ''tremendous,'' and he announced that he would make $35 million available in 13 counties hit hard by the deluge. Those funds are unlikely to cover the tab here in Delaware County. Twenty-two of the 120 bridges inspected in the county so far were destroyed, and fixing them will cost ''an enormous amount, certainly millions of dollars,'' according to the county's planning director, Nicole Franzese. The county still has more than 100 bridges to inspect. Hancock's highway superintendent, Grayling Martin, said that clearing a three-mile stretch of Route 30, a hilly, curvy road that connects Routes 17 and 206, should cost $2 million -- about as much as the town spent in cleanup after the flood of April 2005. ''The priority right now is making the roads a little bit safer, filling up the craters, removing the rocks and the trees that are blocking our access,'' Mr. Martin said. ''We're not even thinking about repaving these roads,'' he said. ''That's something we don't foresee doing for about a year.'' The Town of Hancock calls itself ''the gateway to the Delaware River,'' and for good reason. The town sits at the confluence of the river's east and west branches and is prime fly-fishing territory. About 3,500 people live here year-round and are joined by a nearly equal number of weekend residents, most of whom are from New York City and own half of the homes in town. Jean Anyon, a professor of educational policy at CUNY's Graduate Center in Manhattan, bought a 1912 white and green Victorian 15 years ago in Cadosia, a town hamlet. She spends most weekends and summers at the house, which overlooks a creek that was barely four inches deep in April, when the area went without rain for three weeks. On Tuesday, as the creek topped its banks and water rushed toward her home, Ms. Anyon stood alone in her kitchen, crying and not sure what to do or where to go, she said. By then, 14.5 inches of rain had fallen on Hancock, according to Rolland Bojo Jr., the county's deputy fire coordinator for emergency management, and the creek had risen 15 feet. ''This used to be the most beautiful scene,'' Ms. Anyon said, pointing to a mound of rocks and uprooted trees outside, where a lawn once stood. ''It's all devastation,'' she said. ''I've never thought I'd live through anything like this.'' At the edge of the creek, a white wooden table lay upside down, about 50 feet from the porch where it had once been. A speed-limit sign had impaled an apple tree, as if thrown like a spear. Two doors from Ms. Anyon's home, the summer porch of Florence Vitale's 13-room Colonial had washed away, leaving behind 14 pictures hanging on what had been porch's back wall. Also swept away was part of the rear of the house in which she has lived for 56 years. A chunk of foundation was gone, as if bitten off. ''I'll never live here again,'' said Ms. Vitale, 82, steadying herself with a cane as she walked through the muck that covered her yard. ''I've been here through three floods'' -- 1972, 2004 and 2005, she said -- ''but none of them was like this one.'' Cadosia and three other hamlets -- Lordville, Readburn and Long Flat -- have been without phone service or electricity since Tuesday, when the floodwaters toppled telephone and electrical poles. In some cases, the wires hang dangerously low, within arm's reach. Mr. Rowe, the town supervisor, said that roads will have to be rebuilt before new poles can be affixed to the ground and the power restored. The task of road repair alone is daunting. There are 144 miles of roadway in Hancock, and about 90 percent of it was damaged, Mr. Martin, the highway superintendent, said. The town had set aside $2 million for capital improvements in its current budget and will use the money to cover the initial cost of repairs, Mr. Rowe said. He is hoping the state will pay for the rest. Meanwhile, residents are relying on one another to get by. Frank Passemato Jr., a lieutenant in the town's volunteer Fire Department, went to Ms. Anyon's house Friday morning to pump water out of her cellar, and drove away on an A.T.V. to distribute bottled water all around Cadosia. ''One of the greatest things about this town is that you can count on your neighbors and friends to help you get through the tough times,'' Mr. Passemato Jr., 50, said. ''We'll need a lot of money, a lot of faith and a lot of will power moving forward, but we'll make it. It might just be a while, but we'll make it.''"
"Thousands of refugees from the worst flooding in decades trudged back to water-ravaged homes and mud-streaked towns in the Northeast yesterday as swollen rivers continued to recede and residents and public officials assayed a devastating toll of death and destruction. While the vast latticework of rivers and tributaries from Virginia to Vermont was in retreat from flood stages, officials warned returning evacuees of other dangers -- electrical faults, broken gas lines, fuel spills, contaminated water supplies and possible floor collapses -- and hundreds of others were barred from returning. Those who did were left gawking, dazed by the magnitude of the cleanup and repairs ahead. At least 20 deaths were attributed to the week's flooding. It was still too early to assess the regional costs of the damage definitively, although rough estimates by governors and emergency officials in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and other states in recent days suggested that the losses might run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. President Bush yesterday declared a disaster in eight upstate New York counties hit hard by the flooding: Broome, Chenango, Delaware, Herkimer, Montgomery, Otsego, Sullivan and Ulster Counties. The declaration will make federal aid available to county and eligible local governments there. Gov. George E. Pataki, who had sought the declaration for a 13-county region and had pledged a $35 million state relief package for the area, called the federal response disappointing. ''While we appreciate the complexity and magnitude of the enormous task at hand, some determinations are self-evident,'' Mr. Pataki said in a statement. ''I will continue to press FEMA for a swift, complete and full disaster declaration that meets not only the needs of local government but also the needs of individual hard-pressed New Yorkers.'' Earlier, in response to an appeal from Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania for a declaration covering 34 counties, the president declared only four counties disaster areas. Requests for disaster declarations by the governors of New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia were not immediately answered. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said assessments of flood damage across the region were continuing. Meteorologists said yesterday that the rivers that caused most of the damage, the Delaware and the Susquehanna in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland, had fallen below flood stage. Some sections of the Susquehanna in or near New York's Southern Tier, however -- at Waverly, Pa., Vestal, N.Y., and Conklin, N.Y. -- will probably remain above flood levels for another day, they said. The worst of the flooding was clearly over. But at the start of the long Fourth of July weekend, with sun-drenched beaches, quiet country retreats and carefree days beckoning to millions of Americans, the victims of the deluge faced an altered reality of grief and personal loss that might not be set right for months, if ever. It was not on the scale of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, but it was bad enough: people washed away or killed in other accidents; whole towns coated with sediment; dozens of roads and bridges washed out; some utilities crippled; homes and businesses left without power; and countless possessions destroyed by water. ''Everything I've ever earned in my life is gone,'' Mark Vosbury, 41, said as he surveyed his swamped home and auto dealership next door in Conklin, where he grew up. The house, 400 yards from the Susquehanna, was ringed by a knee-high waterline, cars and motorcycles on his lot lay submerged and his backyard was an oily, hip-deep lake in the brown-black hues of camouflage fatigues. Inside his home, Mr. Vosbury found mud everywhere, on the floors, on the furniture, on his hunting rifles. In the kitchen, his refrigerator lay on its back like a white coffin. He looked dumbfounded by his losses, although outside he managed to comfort a neighbor; she was clutching two family photos and crying. Conklin, a town of about 5,800 people near Binghamton in Broome County, was a community of contrasts. On one side, where homes were untouched by the flooding, people lounged on porches as if nothing had happened. The other side was ghostly, with damage everywhere and many streets still off limits to residents. National guardsmen and state troopers at checkpoints allowed people in and out from 3 to 8 p.m., but only to retrieve possessions and survey damage. ''Everything that's being done is because of safety issues,'' Lt. James Barnes of the state police said. Similarly, about 150 miles to the south, the Island neighborhood of Trenton was still off limits to its 1,300 residents. The floodwaters had retreated from most of the neighborhood, sandwiched between the Delaware River and Route 29, but it was still coated with goopy mud, many basements were flooded and emergency crews were inspecting all 220 homes for electrical faults or damaged gas lines. Trenton's mayor, Douglas H. Palmer, said through a spokesman that he hoped Island residents would be able to return to their homes by Tuesday. Nearby, 200 residents of the Glen Ashton neighborhood found most of their homes unscathed. The exception was a pocket known as the ''Ribeye,'' hugged by Route 29, where basements were full of mud and power was still off. Trenton's water filtration plant was running again after a two-day shutdown, but pressure in some areas was low and residents near Trenton Mercer Airport were told to boil their water. To the northwest in Lambertville, graceful Victorian homes and stone townhouses with sweeping views of the Delaware once again bore the brunt of the floods, as in 2004 and last year. The water sucked out the drawers in Robert and Cathy Berg's kitchen, picked their fireplace apart and smudged their ground-floor walls with a mucky brown waterline three feet up. Outside, city workers hosed down the street and filled trash bins with broken lamps, sodden cabinets and soggy brown rugs. The Bergs' grown daughter, Susy Ventura, thanked one of the workers but could not resist letting off some steam. ''I told my parents, 'you're going to have to do this time and time again,' '' she fumed. ''You've got to sell,'' the worker, Vernon Barlow, advised. Ms. Ventura shook her head emphatically. ''Who's going to buy it, a place that gets flooded again and again?'' ''People from New York,'' Mr. Barlow snapped."
"WHEN he saw how bad it was -- 400,000 soggy cards to throw in the Dumpster, a life's worth of memories turned to waterlogged garbage -- Barry Foster thought: This is it. No more. And then he thought, what kind of an example does he set if he quits? What kind of a message is that? So he'll be back in business as soon as the store dries out, selling what he has left at Hot Corner Sports Collectibles to whoever shows up at what should have been the best weekend of the short Catskill summer. And then after the summer he'll think about it again. He's not a quitter, but he's not an idiot, either. ''Fords, Mantles, Sniders, Koufaxes, I can't tell you everything I threw out,'' said Mr. Foster, a former high school principal who opened up his dream store in time for three nightmare floods, the largest of which came last week, ruining perhaps $100,000 worth of collectibles, a life's work. ''To be honest, I can't think of too many times I've been worse.'' Across Main Street on Friday, the tapestry on the wall at Fir Brook Flies and Supplies showed a fish and the logo ''Welcome to our piece of paradise.'' Paradise had mud on the floor that had reached three feet high when the flood crested and was still caked up in a muddy goo under the fixtures. Inside was a remarkable craftsman named Richard Bradley, who makes custom-made fly reels he sells all over the world. Ninety percent of his inventory was destroyed. He'll have to see what, if anything, can be salvaged of the machinery, buried in water and muck, that he used to make the rods. He figures he'll be back too, though he's not sure how. ''I'm not going to be a Benedict Arnold and cut and run,'' he said, workers sweeping mud off the linoleum behind him. ''But I don't know when people say, ''Enough is enough' '' Offered good luck, he didn't seem to want any. ''Luck,'' he said, ''is for rabbits.'' You can tell the story of the Catskills in this little town at the intersection of three streams, where the sign on Main Street reads: ''Welcome to Livingston Manor: Small town. Big back yard.'' During the golden days of the 50's and 60's it flourished with the Catskill resorts and bungalows. During the grim years, which hit their nadir in the early 90's, it felt like a place in a death spiral, kept alive only because the Livingston Manor lifers were too stubborn to desert the corpse. And these days, it's been the image of the Catskills reborn, both rustic and fashionable, with cool shops and galleries, a bookstore and a bakery. And the population now is a mix -- not always a happy one -- of wary old-timers and hip transplants from New York City. That was before three storms of the century in 22 months. Before the businesses on Main Street dug out three times. And before a 15-year-old girl, who walked around town all day listening to music on her Walkman, was washed away in Wednesday's flood. So there's still brave talk about the town's future. Some buy it. Some don't. ''After the last storm, I said we'd have water running down Main Street, we'd lose houses and we'd lose lives,'' said John Parker. ''No one listened.'' He's standing in front of his house, across from a sign, green spray paint on plywood, reading ''R.I.P. Jaime,'' and the wreckage of the house where the girl, Jaime Bertholf, was swept away when a cascade of water cut a new channel around a bridge clogged with debris, reducing her house to rubble. Had the water stayed where it was, it would have washed away Mr. Parker's house instead. He's not planning to stay around for the next one. ''It's a nice town, but if something isn't done, eventually there isn't going to be a Main Street,'' he said. STILL, on Friday there were fevered efforts to prepare for the weekend. Andrea Brown was cleaning up her month-old gallery, the Outsider Art Studio, to prepare for a show opening today. It's not too often you get to say you'll be ready come hell or high water and mean it literally. Across the street at the terrific Hamish & Henry bookstore, Jeff Christensen said people were trying to look ahead. ''The first order of business is bucking up the spirits of downtrodden retailers,'' he said. ''We just have to see what kind of financial support we can get so retailers don't say, 'We can't do this anymore.' '' Actually if that's Item 1, then Item 1A, after years of bickering and delay, is getting critical mass from state and federal officials for a regional plan for dealing with flood control and river maintenance. It's one of those things that never seem too urgent, until a 15-year-old girl is swept away into a roaring flood, until a town and a region face three catastrophes in two years, until people realize you can face three strikes but maybe you just can't handle one more.

"Cows in Vermont, and there are a bunch, can usually count on a few things. Quaint-seeking tourists snap their pictures. Trinket shops sell their likenesses on needlepoint pillows and welcome mats. And there is plenty of prime food to eat because in spring and summer, dairy farmers literally make lots of hay while the sun shines. But the sun has not been shining this year. Not for much of May and June, anyway. And record rainfall, combined with dismally low milk prices and rising fuel prices, has Vermont's dairy farming industry in a crisis. ''It's what I call the trifecta: It's low milk prices, bad weather and the cost of staying in business,'' said Gerry Audet, 54, of Orwell, Vt. Mr. Audet, a dairy farmer for 37 years on a farm his family has run since 1936, gave up a few weeks ago and sold his cows. His is one of at least 46 dairy farms, out of 1,200 in the state, that have folded in recent months, a higher than usual number, farm economists say. ''I'm running a hundred-cow dairy here,'' Mr. Audet said, ''and it's just gotten to the point where I can't stay in business.'' Statewide, the situation for dairy farms, which make up 85 percent of Vermont's agriculture, has gotten so tough that on Monday, the federal Department of Agriculture declared the entire state a disaster zone, making cheap emergency loans available to farmers. And Gov. Jim Douglas convened an emergency ''dairy summit'' on Thursday, announcing that the state would give farmers $8.6 million in cash assistance because the situation was so dire that federal help was not enough. ''I refuse to let the agricultural industry of Vermont slip away,'' Mr. Douglas, a Republican, said at the summit. In an interview, the governor said: ''A number of farmers have lost over half their crops, and we estimate about $53 million or $54 million in reported losses. It's part of our culture, our way of life. They are the stewards of the land, and they maintain the working landscape that's so important to our natural beauty and our tourism. I believe this is a particularly critical time for them, and that's why we need to do everything we can to help them.'' Virtually every dairy farmer has been affected. ''It's just been so wet that we couldn't do anything,'' said Henry Magnan, who milks 550 Holsteins with his four sons in Fairfield, where rain has twice flooded his street (Chester Arthur Road, after the president who spent his infancy here) and made it impassable. For weeks, the fields have been so wet that the Magnans, members of a dairy cooperative that supplies the milk for Ben and Jerry's ice cream, could not plant corn to feed their cows. Some 85 acres of hay they had also counted on became so moldy, rotten-smelling and infiltrated by mushrooms that the Magnans had to chop it up and let it molder on the ground. Tractors trying to work their land are getting mired in mud. All this will mean mounting costs to buy feed they would have grown, said one son, Mark Magnan. And assuming they get a crop of hay and corn later in the summer, the quality will be poorer, which will cause cows to produce less milk to sell and require farmers to buy protein to supplement the poor feed. Add to that the price of fuel, which increases the cost of operating tractors, transporting milk to market, trucking in supplies and even using fertilizer made from natural gas. With milk prices low, the Magnans said they had been recouping only about $11.50 of the $15 it cost them to produce 100 pounds of milk. ''Most dairy farmers weren't exactly rolling in cash when these problems started,'' said Matt Harvey, who milks 140 cows in Florence. ''A lot of us are living off of our reserves or at least tapping into them.'' The number of dairy farmers has been declining in Vermont and elsewhere for years, with small family farms selling to larger ones and young people opting out of agriculture. But Robert L. Parsons, an economist at the University of Vermont, said the current situation seemed particularly difficult, with more farms folding this year than before. Although there has been no decline in the number of cows or the amount of milk produced, Professor Parsons said a decline in dairy farmers had hit the state hard. ''Vermont is the most dairy-dependent state in the country,'' he said. ''People say the top five agricultural products in Vermont are dairy, dairy, dairy, dairy and dairy. This image of the independent small farmers grazing their cows on the hillside, is that a disappearing picture? Many of the people are afraid that it is.'' Farmers trying to keep their business afloat have taken a variety of steps. Some have shifted to producing organic milk, which draws a higher price but also requires an investment of time, money and land that not every farmer can afford. A few are going the route of the Blue Spruce Farm in Bridport, which has found a way to wring greater value out of a commodity it produces in abundance: manure. The farm extracts methane gas from the manure and sends the methane through a generator, which makes electricity. The Central Vermont Public Service Company sells the electricity to customers for 4 cents per kilowatt hour more than regular electric power (which sells for 11.4 cents per kilowatt hour for residential customers), and the farm pockets the 4 cents. So far, about 3,000 customers have signed up. Marie Audet, part of the family running Blue Spruce, said there was another benefit: removing the methane also removes that classic manure smell, so ''the separated manure solids can be used as bedding for the cows instead of sawdust.'' Governor Douglas said one of his wife's brothers, Robert Foster, had augmented his dairy income by selling potting soil made from manure. ''He calls it Moo Doo,'' the governor said, ''and it's sold up and down the East Coast.'' But many farmers are struggling to make the economics work. Harvey Smith, a state representative, sold the cows on his farm in New Haven, Vt., a few months ago. Chris Fay, who milks 200 Jersey cows in Maidstone in northeastern Vermont, where fields have been swimming in rain, said he was taking austerity measures: cutting fertilizer use and giving up some power in his tractor by ''shifting up a gear so you don't burn as much fuel.'' Mr. Fay, 26, who farms with his father, said, ''We try never to talk about it too much, but at some point in time we got to figure out whether it's feasible or not'' to stay in business. Steve Kerr, Vermont's agriculture secretary, who has been lobbying Congress for more aid, said: ''We're very, very, very worried about this. Dairy farmers, they don't give up easily. But you can only take so many shots to the torso before you're done.''"
"Almost three weeks after floodwaters swept through parts of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania with a destructive force not experienced in decades, residents and officials are struggling to begin a vast recovery effort that could end up costing $1 billion or more. The geographic scale of the disaster was so immense, with most of the worst effects in rural communities, that the full scope of the destruction is still being assessed. Forty-five counties in the three states have been declared federal disaster areas. ''The amount of damage and the extent of flooding are the most seen in 30 years,'' said Larry Sommers, the deputy field coordinator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency in New York State. Officials say that dozens of communities are coping with the loss of their business districts. Possibly hundreds of roads and bridges were obliterated or remain closed. Some homes still lack power, though how many is unclear. The recent heat and humidity have caused outbreaks of mold in waterlogged houses. Boil-water orders remain in effect in some areas. And at one waste-water treatment plant, in Oneonta, N.Y., raw sewage continues to flow into the Susquehanna River. More than 15,000 people have applied for federal disaster assistance so far. Yet many of them are still waiting to receive aid checks and have been unable to begin the task of rebuilding. ''The response has just been very slow,'' said Thomas L. Quackenbush, the chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Montgomery County in New York. ''In my little village, the lumberyard, the grocery store, the restaurant, the farm-supply store -- nothing's reopened,'' he continued. ''There was a 94-year-old lady who was walking around the other day with bread bags on her feet, because the water was still in her house, and she has no power. How many of those stories are out there?'' Mr. Quackenbush and his fellow supervisors proposed a plan last week to use county money to make loans to residents. But they scrapped the plan after learning that the State Constitution would not allow it. ''We can't use our taxpayer dollars to help our own taxpayers, but we can use them to rebuild countries like Iraq and Afghanistan?'' he said. ''People just don't have the money to spend on repairs.'' State and federal officials say they are working as fast as they can to get the needed help to victims of flooding. And in some communities, the police and local emergency management officials, joined by utility crews, the National Guard and even New York City sanitation crews, have been working around the clock. As a result, many roads have been reopened, mounds of debris have been removed, much of the electrical power has been restored, and many of the newly homeless have been housed with family and friends. The most positive sign, officials say, is the dramatic increase in the number of counties that have received federal disaster declarations in the past two weeks. President Bush has now declared a disaster in 21 counties in Pennsylvania, 20 in New York and 4 in New Jersey. The declarations make federal aid available to eligible local governments and residents. Still, state officials urged patience. ''This problem is not going to go away in two weeks, and the governor and the state are committed to working with these counties throughout the course of this disaster,'' said John R. Gibb, director of New York's State Emergency Management Office. New York has taken the unusual step of creating its own $35 million assistance program for flood victims. In addition, Gov. George E. Pataki has pledged to help local governments with the expense of infrastructure repairs. The federal government covers 75 percent of approved costs in counties that received a ''public assistance'' disaster declaration, while the state and local governments typically split the remaining 25 percent. But the state says it will cover the entire 25 percent. The floods of June 27, stretching from Virginia to Vermont, were blamed for at least 20 deaths. Many areas saw waters rise up to the second stories of buildings, while in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., water nearly reached the top of a 41-foot-high levee. Days of torrential rain set records in places and forced the Delaware, Susquehanna and Mohawk Rivers -- along with countless other rivers, creeks and streams -- over their banks. Damage assessments are just getting to state officials, and are mostly rough estimates. But the numbers are big. Broome County in New York estimated that it has $175 million in total damage, state officials reported. In the three-state region, the damage to public infrastructure and personal property could easily exceed a billion dollars, officials say. For some communities, it was the third time in two years that residents had endured a devastating flood. That may explain why more residents than in the past have sought help for frayed nerves and feelings of despair. ''We have mental health counselors in these centers,'' said Dorothy Ower, the deputy coordinating officer for the federal agency in New Jersey. ''There's a higher incidence of people looking for some counseling.'' In the tourist town of New Hope, Pa., some businesses had not entirely recovered from a flood in April 2005. Gerenser's Exotic Ice Cream, for example, has yet to replace production equipment that the earlier flood knocked out. The recent deluge cost the Gerenser family their best holiday weekend, the Fourth of July. Their shop reopened last Sunday. Emergency management personnel say that in New York State, some of the worst damage was suffered in Herkimer, Montgomery, Broome and Delaware Counties. In Pennsylvania, among the hardest-hit were Susquehanna, Wyoming, Luzerne and Columbia Counties. Of the four counties in New Jersey declared disaster areas, Warren took the strongest punch, officials said. In some communities, there is worry that the flood may spell their doom. In Walton, N.Y., in Delaware County, the floodwaters swept away cars and dairy cows, along with some building foundations. Bridges remain closed, parking lots have been reduced to rubble, and slate sidewalks heave upward like pieces from a jigsaw puzzle. Towns' waterlogged records are being freeze-dried in hopes of salvaging them. Dozens of downtown businesses remain heavily damaged or closed, including the town's sole grocery store, the Big M, which had held a ribbon-cutting on a major expansion just two weeks before the flood. ''If these businesses don't reopen, we're going to lose this community,'' said Mayor Edward Snow. One of the town's major employers, the Kraft Foods plant, will not commit to staying on if it faces the threat of another costly flood, the mayor said. In rural Susquehanna County, Pa., parts of 12 state roads remain closed, along with nine state bridges, according to Mark R. Wood, director of emergency management for the county. Three county bridges were completely wiped out and 24 municipal bridges are ''questionable,'' with six of those closed. The housing picture, too, is bleak. Two dozen houses are ''either nonexistent or no longer livable,'' Mr. Wood said. An initial assessment found that 986 homes and 110 businesses had experienced some type of flood damage. Mr. Wood is advising people to take action now, even before receiving federal emergency money. ''We recommend that they go ahead and start cleaning up because you don't want problems with mold,'' he said. Meanwhile, federal officials are trying to reassure the public that money is getting out on the streets, as they put it. As of Friday, the federal agency had already approved $6.6 million in New York, with checks totaling $2.2 million already sent out, said Mr. Sommers, of the agency in Albany. In Pennsylvania, $5 million had been disbursed to help displaced homeowners and renters with short-term housing and immediate repairs, said Justin Fleming, a spokesman for the state's Emergency Management Agency. And in New Jersey, where the scope of the damage was smaller, about $140,000 has been distributed, Mrs. Ower said. Many flood victims are trying hard to stay positive. Leslie Rockefeller, 82, and his wife, Doris, 89, of Montgomery County, N.Y., went to the federal agency for help. (They are part of ''the'' Rockefeller family, but from a less wealthy branch.) Living 60 years in the same brick Victorian in the town of St. Johnsville, the couple had never been flooded before. But the water from Zimmerman Creek wrecked their property, sucking out their home's foundation, as well as the contents of their basement and kitchen. They never did see any sign of their roasting pans, coffee urns, or the pine chest that Mrs. Rockefeller had recently refinished. ''We stayed there until the walls started coming down,'' said Mr. Rockefeller, holding folders full of applications and brochures that he had just collected from a disaster assistance center. But the couple said they felt blessed to have one another, their health and the ability -- they hope -- to return home. ''You know what our daughter says?'' asked Mr. Rockefeller. ''Granddaughter,'' his wife corrected. '' 'Suck it up and get on with your life,' '' he said. ''It's a good philosophy,'' she said."
"The flooding that swallowed up communities along the Susquehanna and Delaware Rivers this week was not merely the result of what meteorologists call a striking rain event, three to five inches of rain across large areas in just a few hours. It was also caused by all the rain leading up to the deluge, saturating the ground. The storm, which set records in some areas for both rainfall totals and flood levels, was the third in as many years to cause extensive damage in the two river basins, prompting some to wonder whether the extreme weather patterns that scientists say accompany global warming have already arrived. The Susquehanna travels for 444 miles from its headwaters near Cooperstown, N.Y., south through Pennsylvania to the Chesapeake Bay, and many of the river's tributaries and streams -- there are 48,000 miles of them -- started to flood on Monday. The river itself crested late Wednesday and early yesterday, reaching 26 feet in Danville, Pa., six feet above flood stage. Along the Delaware, which flows for 330 miles from the Catskills to the Delaware Bay, the rain also caused swollen creeks and streams, which, in turn, forced up the river levels long after the downpours ended. In Riegelsville, N.J., just south of Easton, Pa., the river rose to 33 feet early yesterday afternoon, 12 feet above flood stage. The flooding along the two rivers prompted declarations of emergencies, mass evacuations, rescues and untold property damage claims. Along both rivers, there were scenes of rooftops poking out from a muddy expanse of water. The approaches to flood control are markedly different along the two rivers, though. The Susquehanna, considered one of the most flood-prone rivers in the country, has an extensive system of levees, walls and flood-control dams, said Susan Obleski, a spokeswoman for the Susquehanna River Basin Commission. The 27,510-square-mile basin -- bigger than Vermont, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Delaware combined -- is laced with shallow streams that flood easily. ''The river is very shallow as well, so it doesn't take a lot of rain before it starts to overflow its banks,'' she said. ''We're particularly vulnerable to flash flooding.'' There are a total of 35 flood-control structures maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers along the river basin. On Wednesday, officials in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., held out hope that the towering flood wall there would contain the water. It did, and the water crested 6 or 7 feet below the top of the 41-foot floodwalls. While it is too early to say what the flood-control structures up and down the river accomplished in this storm, the commission estimates that in 2004, the bulwark held back 135 billion gallons of floodwater, preventing $1.6 billion of additional damage. The Delaware, by contrast, has no concrete flood walls or protection dams, although there are five dams on the tributaries that feed it, said Clarke Rupert, a spokesman for the Delaware River Basin Commission. In the 1970's, a plan for a major dam project at Tocks Island that would have supplied hydroelectric power, drinking water and flood protection on the Delaware was shelved after a huge outcry. The land that was purchased by the federal government in anticipation of the project later became the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. Because much of the nontidal portion of the Delaware has a federal designation of ''wild and scenic,'' it is unlikely that anyone will revive attempts to create a new flood-control project any time soon. '' 'Wild and scenic' has to do with the free-flowing nature of a river,'' Mr. Rupert said. ''The Delaware is the longest undammed river east of the Mississippi. It's been our experience that the approach to dealing with flood losses has shifted away from constructing new dams and levees to local measures like property acquisition, flood proofing, flood plain regulation and storm water management.'' Environmental advocates and scientists have long cited the practice of building on flood plains as a cause of the devastation caused by rising rivers, but the recurrence of major floods in the East in recent years is also prompting new worries about global warming. Claudia Tebaldi, a project scientist for the National Center for Atmospheric Research, in Colorado, said in a telephone interview that it was impossible to link a specific storm to climate change. ''But we know that in a warm climate, the likelihood of getting intense precipitation events increases,'' she said. Mr. Rupert pointed out that this is not the first time that major floods have occurred within a brief period. Flood crest figures for the Delaware in Trenton show that the highest crest occurred in 1904 and the third-highest in 1903. ''If we were conducting this interview 100 years ago, we would be talking about two tremendous floods that took place in the span of six months,'' he said. Still, he said, the recent floods are right up there. The storm in September 2004 -- remnants of Tropical Storm Ivan -- ranked sixth, while last year's storm in April was fourth. This year's should also make the short list. The water levels had reached 24.97 feet in Trenton as of yesterday evening, which could make it the new No. 5. But it was unclear if the river had actually crested. ''The jury is still out, so to speak,'' Mr. Rupert said."
"It would seem that misery, like water, flows downstream. A day after a nexus of swollen rivers spilled their banks in some of the worst floods in the Mid-Atlantic region in decades, the waters slowly started to recede yesterday. But trouble did not go with them. From upstate New York to Philadelphia, there were flooded homes and businesses, washed-out bridges, closed roadways, inundated streets and untold millions of dollars in damage. Most of that occurred along the twin paths of the Susquehanna and the Delaware Rivers, which overflowed for much of the day. For people on the Delaware, in particular, canoes replaced cars, and homes were ruined yet again by high water for the third time in 21 months. [Page B1.] The devastation, however, was unequally divided. In Wilkes-Barre, Pa., where nearly 200,000 people were ordered to evacuate on Wednesday night, the levees on the Susquehanna held, and the evacuation order was rescinded. Even so, 6,000 people remained in shelters yesterday, and parts of town were still so wet that striped bass were seen swimming on the streets. On the other hand, almost 75 percent of Conklin, N.Y., near Binghamton, was under water as the Susquehanna there crested at almost 25 feet, 14 feet above its flood level. The waters rose above the mailboxes, and the air stank heavily of fish. A dead cow floated by. ''The peak of the flooding is moving downstream now,'' said Geoff Cornish, a meteorologist for Pennsylvania State University. Mr. Cornish said that the lower reaches of the Delaware River Valley would probably be the worst -- and last -- areas to be hit yesterday by the floods as days of rainwater worked through a circulatory system of tributaries into the river. The overspilling itself was largely expected to be over by this afternoon, but even so, the high water has already been blamed for 15 deaths in the region, and the National Weather Service said it could be days before water drains from flooded areas. That means it could take until the weekend or beyond before work crews can start repairing damaged buildings, bridges and roads. While it was too early to determine precisely the extent of the damage, Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey said that the destruction was reminiscent of flooding in April 2005 that caused $30 million in damage. Gov. George E. Pataki of New York estimated damage in his state to be closer to $100 million. ''Unparalleled devastation,'' he said. Weather experts said the flooding was a combination of what they called a ''striking rain event'' -- three to five inches of rain across entire states in just a few hours -- and a steady buildup of rain over days. The storm system, which set records in some areas both for total rainfall and for flood levels, was the third in three years to cause extensive flooding in the two sprawling river basins. There was a tone of grim inevitability on Wednesday when officials in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania announced that rivers in their states were going to crest. Evacuations were planned, sandbags laid, boats acquired, National Guard troops mobilized. If the waters were coming, people knew. But when the waters came, there was not much to do except ride them out. In Phillipsburg, N.J., the Delaware crested at nearly 38 feet, nearly 15 feet above flood stage, and in Trenton it crested at nearly 25 feet, about 5 feet above flood stage. The entire state of New Jersey remained under an emergency declaration yesterday, as more than 6,000 people were forced from their homes. The mayor of Trenton, Douglas Palmer, said that the city had only enough drinking water left for a day and a half because it had to close its filtration plant. Ten bridges over the Delaware River between Pennsylvania and New Jersey were closed. At least 3,000 people were forced from their homes in New York, where Governor Pataki extended Wednesday's state of emergency to four more counties, bringing the total to 13. Near Binghamton, the Susquehanna rose 14 feet above flood stage, to almost 26 feet. In the city itself, where water topped the floodwalls of the river Wednesday evening, the deluge had significantly receded by yesterday afternoon. The residential west side of the city was still flooded, however, and many streets were closed to traffic. In Delaware County in upstate New York, bordered by the Susquehanna and where the east and west branches of the Delaware River run, officials said damage was pervasive. Roads were closed throughout the county, communities were evacuated, nearly 8,000 people lost power and at least three towns had to truck in drinking water. More than a dozen bridges were washed away, according to a preliminary assessment. ''We got flooded in all four of the watershed basins. I don't think this has happened before,'' said Nicole Franzese, the county's planning director. In Wilkes-Barre, some 50,000 people had fled on Wednesday night, but the Susquehanna there rose only to 34 feet, well below its 41-foot floodwalls. The levees, reinforced in 2004, did not break. Because the order to evacuate Wilkes-Barre was given on Wednesday at 1 p.m., the evacuation itself was fairly calm, ''busy, not panicky,'' as one woman said. In West Pittston, 15 miles up the river from Wilkes-Barre, most of the water had receded from the streets by half-past noon, leaving behind a wake of mud and dust. Contractors went to work quickly, pumping water from basements and spraying disinfectant on soon-to-be moldy carpets. The Susquehanna looked bucolic in the sun, but residents emerged from their homes to find that overnight they had acquired pools of water in their backyards. Then there was Conklin, to the north in New York, where the water burst through windows and into living rooms, pouring out of homes and back onto the street and dragging whatever stood in its way: tables, televisions, plants, stoves. On the lot at Cycle Center, a motorcycle shop, the handlebars of a Harley-Davidson poked up from underwater, looking like a pair of antelope horns. ''There have been floods before, but nothing like this, nothing compared to this,'' the town's supervisor, Debbie Preston, said. ''Half the town is wiped out. Even my house is gone.'' ''It's total devastation,'' Ms. Preston said. ''Most of our people have no insurance, and they've lost everything. How do you get back on your feet after something like that, I just don't know.'' On the Delaware, the rising water filled a McDonald's in Easton, Pa., as well as an Exxon station, its gasoline tanks peeking out only inches above the spill. New Hope, Pa., had a ghost-town look, with empty, sodden streets, darkened shop windows and no sounds at all, save those from pumps and generators working at the overflowing riverbanks. Water lapped the underside of the Lambertville-New Hope Bridge, then flowed downstream, where it surrounded the historic Bucks County Playhouse. Farther downstream, in Yardley, Pa., just upriver from Trenton, hundreds of residents living in the blocks between the river and the Delaware Canal evacuated their homes, then stood on the banks, watching as the brown muddy water swirled past, and through, their houses. ''It's very discouraging,'' said Stella Ficiak, whose raised ranch house on Letchworth Avenue was partly submerged for the third time in the last three years. ''It took us so long to fix it up after the last flood. We were just done, and now we have to start all over again.''"
"In Phillipsburg, N.J., Patricia Potts swore that she would move out of her row house after losing all of her appliances to the Delaware River for the third time. A neighbor, Dave Yacko, who was floating down the flooded street in two inner tubes tied together, called out, ''I enjoy this.'' And at the town library, Tracy Wadhams was taking a break after spending the night in her van with her wire fox terriers because the Red Cross shelter in Phillipsburg would not have been a practical place for them. Up and down the banks of the rain-swollen Delaware River, from the New York border to Delaware Bay, yesterday was a day to take stock of the flooding that was not yet going away. And with the misery, on the day that the river crested at most points, came exasperation, fatigue and mordant humor. In Lambertville, about 15 miles north of Trenton, where the basements of riverfront houses were under water, Don Colombo offered neighbors canoe rides to check on their houses until the police reprimanded him. ''The currents along the street are too strong,'' Mr. Colombo, a retired teacher, explained sheepishly. After several relatively dry decades, scores of river towns in Pennsylvania and New Jersey were engulfed for the third time in 21 months. The losses were hard to bear, especially for those displaced again. ''It's a lot of work, it's wrenching, it's depressing and it takes a toll on you,'' Carol Sanderson, of Trenton, said after she was forced from her house once again. Trenton -- with the largest population of the riverfront cities and towns -- suffered the most disruption. About 1,500 people were told on Wednesday to evacuate their homes in the Island and Glen Afton neighborhoods -- just as they did in September 2004 and April 2005. Yesterday afternoon, ducks paddled on the quiet brown lake that covered the streets of the Island -- so called because it is cut off from the rest of the city by a four-lane highway. Except for the occasional police van or National Guard truck rolling across the shallow edge to make sure no one entered, the Island was still. Melvena Barnes, holding her week-old infant, Korentney, remained separated from her apartment building by a moat; she wanted to see the damage after taking the train from her mother's house in nearby Bensalem, Pa., where she had spent the night. Last year she and her two sons were in a basement apartment and lost everything. She now has a first-floor apartment, which she fled Wednesday morning with not much more than her children's clothes. ''I just had a C-section, too,'' she said. ''I'm not supposed to be out and doing much. ''I'm sorry, but this is every year,'' Ms. Barnes added. ''It's nobody's fault, but I'm done.'' Neville Gordon, who was on a city cleanup crew that scraped muck, debris and dead fish into a front-end loader after the last flood, stared sadly at the Island. Mr. Gordon said he had nearly bought a house there himself, but credited his father in Jamaica with thinking better of it: ''The wise man lives on the rock. The beaches look beautiful, but look at the ocean -- it's almost as high as the beach.'' Residents and merchants of some river towns were looking at losses to their livelihood. In Lambertville, a town thick with antique shops and art galleries along the narrow streets, white swans glided along Lambert Lane. Just across the river in New Hope, Pa., a town known for its bohemian past and kitschy present; and with a Main Street that ordinarily would be jammed with tourists wandering in and out of the shops and restaurants this time of year, was ghostly. Bob Gerenser, the owner of Gerenser's Exotic Ice Cream shop, had emptied his basement Wednesday, pulling out seven freezers, loading them on a flatbed truck. His Fourth of July business was doomed. ''I'd still be open if they let me,'' said Mr. Gerenser, whose shop will soon celebrate its 60th year there. ''I make my year's profit this weekend.'' Since he had no word on when gas or electricity would be restored, and since restaurants must have their water tested by the health authorities before reopening, Mr. Gerenser predicted that it would be next week before he could reopen his doors. The April 2005 flood closed the shop for 10 days. Everywhere, those on the river banks struggled with the question of how many floods are too many. ''When you live through one of these big ones, you think this should be it, that this was the hundred-year flood,'' said Rick Buxton, who had waded through chest-high waters to survey the damage to his house in Frenchtown, about 15 miles upriver from Lambertville. Only the basement was under water. ''So when it happens again, do you think, 'This ought to be the end of this now?' '' he said. ''I don't know. It's a tough call.'' Far upriver, in Phillipsburg, some had already decided. Ms. Potts, who had again lost her appliances, said: ''This is nuts. I'm out of here. This is it for me, after the last two. This is the topper.'' Ms. Wadhams, the woman with all the wire fox terriers, said her house, in Belvidere, was impossible to reach, the garage was under water and anything in her yard that was not tied down was far down the Delaware. This had happened before, she said: She was still doing paperwork on insurance claims from the previous storms. Most people said they were simply aching to get back into their own houses -- for now. Even while public officials said the evacuations were almost uniformly smooth and the shelters well prepared, few of the displaced stayed in them. The Red Cross center at Easton High School took in only nine people on Wednesday night, a volunteer there said. ''If they can get in their houses, they just aren't going to come here,'' said the volunteer, Mr. Stotek. ''That's just the way people are.'' Stephen and Wade Allegar were among the few who settled in at the shelter after leaving their house north of Easton, where the river crested at 37 feet, about 15 feet above flood stage. ''There's no way to get to it,'' Mr. Allegar said. ''We had to leave two cats behind.''"
"All across the Eastern seaboard -- from Virginia to Vermont -- the main stems of the major rivers are cresting high above flood stage, thanks to a soggy spring and an unusual series of storms that have dumped incredible amounts of rain upon the region in the past week. In many places, the floods, which have caused 15 deaths so far, have brought traffic to a standstill. Truck stops all along the major interstates -- including I-90 in New York -- are backed up with 18-wheelers waiting for the go-ahead. It is like a scene out of the dead of winter, in the midst of a blizzard, except that all this water is rushing downstream, carrying the crest of flooding with it. In some places, this is a repeat of April 2005, when the Delaware River washed over its banks. But this time around, the flooding is worse and more widespread. Washington, D.C., and Binghamton, N.Y., have both been battered by heavy rains. Perhaps the one hopeful note is the knowledge that a week of dry weather will see these floods abate as quickly as they rose. But who, in the Northeast, has seen a week of dry weather this summer? There is no minimizing the deaths or the damage, but these storms have affected most people on a more mundane level. In parts of New England there is almost a grim refusal to talk about the weather, as if it has all been said already and proven useless. Anyone who works outside for a living -- gardeners, painters, contractors -- has more or less used up a year's supply of stoicism already, with most of the summer still ahead of them. We can only hope that, with luck, the rain-date for June will turn out to be July. Editorial"
"A network of swollen rivers, heavy from days of steady rain, spilled across their banks yesterday, threatening to inundate towns and cities from Virginia to Vermont and causing thousands of evacuations along the banks of the Susquehanna and Delaware Rivers in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Two hundred thousand residents threatened by the rising Susquehanna were ordered to leave the Wilkes-Barre, Pa., area, directed by radio broadcasts to high schools, police stations and firehouses for shelter. Thousands more were evacuated from their homes in the region. At G.A.R. High School in Wilkes-Barre last night, more than 250 people, mostly elderly or infirm, were camped out on cots and on the floor. In the auditorium a platoon of the elderly nodded off in stiff fold-down seats. Earlier in the week, Washington suffered the worst two days of rain in its history. A two-punch combination of saturated earth and rising currents led to at least 10 deaths and reports of two houses, one with a 15-year-old girl trapped inside, set adrift. The day of devastation led the governors of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania to declare emergencies across wide swaths of their states. The potential for destruction was so widespread and unpredictable that the National Weather Service issued flood warnings for eight states. Even as the sun began to break out in parts of the Northeast, officials warned that the worst might be yet to come. Residents in parts of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia were cautioned that more flooding might occur today as rivers crested their banks. The damage from the floods was still being tallied late last night, and the reports were sobering. Two truck drivers died near Sidney, N.Y., 35 miles from Binghamton, when their rigs plunged into a 50-foot-deep hole in the washed-out bed of Interstate 88, and a 15-year-old Pennsylvania boy as well as someone trying to rescue him drowned in a lake in Luzerne County, officials said. Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania declared emergencies in 46 of the state's 67 counties and activated 1,000 members of the National Guard, saying the storms were ''a major hardship.'' Entire villages in Delaware County, N.Y., were left stranded. Several people were reported missing, their fates unknown. The storms were fiercest, Mr. Miner said, in a corridor that ran from Virginia through eastern Pennsylvania to central New York, where Binghamton received 4.05 inches of rain on Tuesday -- the most in one day in the city's history. The most intense flooding seemed to be occurring along the banks of three rivers: the Susquehanna, the Delaware and the Schuylkill. Officials said they expected the Susquehanna to crest its 41-foot floodwalls today. In Binghamton, 3,000 people were evacuated from hospitals and homes, even as the stranded sipped cocktails on the terrace of the Holiday Inn downtown and watched the Chenango River breach its banks. Nearby, floodwaters lapped the retaining walls of the Susquehanna. Divers and boats of the New York State Police were helping the evacuees. At the same time, the Delaware was also rising quickly, officials in New Jersey said, in part because upriver in New York and Pennsylvania, some towns and cities had opened floodgates to empty their own flooding lakes into the river. ''Believe it or not,'' said Col. Joseph R. Fuentes, superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, ''they're getting even more rain than we are.'' Don Maurer, spokesman for the New York State Emergency Management Office, confirmed that some upriver towns had opened their floodgates, saying it was standard procedure in a downpour. ''They're trying to minimize the release, however,'' he said, ''because they're well aware of the impact downstream.'' The Delaware was expected to crest this afternoon at 28 feet -- 3 feet higher than in the severe flooding in April 2005. By last night the floods had already shut down parts of Trenton, as Gov. Jon S. Corzine ordered most state buildings to be closed through today. Six thousand people in New Jersey were evacuated, mostly in Trenton, and officials there said it was the city's worst flooding since 1955. The State House was kept open, although the main highway to the building, Route 29, was closed for several miles near downtown Trenton. At a news conference several blocks from the river in a neighborhood called the Island, Mr. Corzine said, ''We're standing on a spot that in the next 24 to 36 hours we expect to be under water.'' The Schuylkill River was expected to crest in Philadelphia this morning. It flooded over its banks yesterday, closing Kelly Drive on the east side of the river, and later Martin Luther King Jr. Drive on the west. Admiral Wilson Boulevard, the main road to the Benjamin Franklin Bridge into downtown Philadelphia from New Jersey, was flooded yesterday morning as well. At the Pepacton Reservoir in Delaware County, N.Y., which supplies drinking water to New York City, the water was flowing over the dam's spillway last night at 19,721 cubic feet per second, said Nicole Franzese, Delaware County's planning director. The county was one of nine in New York placed in a state of emergency by Gov. George E. Pataki. And although much of the rain had tapered off by yesterday afternoon, the number of streams and rivers reported to be flooding continued to pile up, including the Roanoke River in Virginia and the Mohawk and Neversink Rivers in New York. Even Esopus and Rondout Creeks in New York State rose above their banks. The overflowing Cattail Brook in Livingston Manor, N.Y., suddenly swept one house from its foundation and, with the 15-year-old girl inside, dumped it in the water. John Parker, a neighbor, said that rescue workers had been trying to reach the girl, whom he identified as Jamie Bertholf, a classmate of his daughter. She is missing and presumed dead. To the east of Binghamton, about 120 National Guardsmen were deployed to help with evacuations in the town of Walton, another flood-prone area near the reservoir. Asked about damage to homes in the area, Mr. Maurer said, ''I don't think it'll look as dramatic as New Orleans, but if it's your house. '' Along the Jersey Shore, environmental officials were monitoring bacteria levels at the beaches, which often rise to unsafe levels during flooding. Elaine Makatura, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Conservation, said that increased levels of enterococci bacteria had been found at some bay beaches, but so far not along the ocean. In Washington, the federal government closed the National Archives, the Justice Department and the offices of the Internal Revenue Service. Yesterday the storms -- and the flooding -- moved beyond the capital and toward the suburbs. In Rockville, Md., for instance, more than 2,000 people were evacuated from around Lake Needwood, as waters rose to nearly 25 feet above normal levels, emergency officials said. In western Maryland, three people were rescued from a stalled car late Tuesday, only to die when the floodwaters carried them from the bed of a pickup truck, officials said. Edward J. McDonough, spokesman for the Maryland Emergency Management Agency, said that two teenagers who went to check on the rising waters of Little Pipe Creek in Carroll County were presumed dead. Officials in Pennsylvania said that a driver was killed near Gettysburg when she lost control of her car and hit a truck, and an elderly man died after his car washed off a bridge near Equinunk on the Delaware River, the state police said. A search continued for an 8-year-old girl swept away in the raging waters in southwest Virginia, and another search was taking place for two teenagers who disappeared near a swollen creek in Keymar, Md., the state police there said. Meanwhile, law enforcement agencies from the National Guard to the Coast Guard to the state police in several states came to the rescue of the soaked and stranded, using everything from sandbags to helicopters. The deluge, from the earth and sky, demolished house and highway alike. Parts of the Pennsylvania Turnpike were closed; so too was the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y. Then there was the house that was spotted drifting down the Susquehanna River in New York -- on fire for a while, it seemed. ''When the house was torn up, the gas was still on,'' said Mr. Maurer, the spokesman for the New York State emergency office. ''And it ignited.'' Correction: July 4, 2006, Tuesday An article on Thursday about flooding in the Mid-Atlantic states misstated the name of New Jersey's environmental agency, which was monitoring bacteria levels at the state's beaches. It is the Department of Environmental Protection, not Conservation."
"New Orleans still faces serious street flooding in coming storms because the Army Corps of Engineers has fallen behind in repairing the city's hurricane protection system, Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, said in a letter to be sent today to President Bush. Extensive flooding could occur even in heavy rainstorms, Mr. Vitter said, and a hurricane could have enormous consequences for the restoration of New Orleans. ''The threat is, we get significant flooding because of corps failures this hurricane season, and it kills our recovery,'' he said. Echoing concerns of New Orleans activists and officials, Mr. Vitter said the corps had not provided enough pumping capacity to get water out of the city's drainage canals in heavy storms. If the corps must close the new floodgates it built at the mouths of those canals against a storm, street flooding will probably result. Although the corps has largely completed its sweeping project to repair the city's levee system, and is getting pumps in place, it has acknowledged falling behind in the effort to install enough pumps to get large amounts of water out of the drainage canals. The corps has committed to increasing the pumping capacity over time, said Col. Richard P. Wagenaar, the commander of the New Orleans district. There have been ''a whole host of technical issues'' at the cramped, mucky construction sites, Colonel Wagenaar said, but ''the corps has got to do their best to mitigate any future damage.'' But Mr. Vitter said that after months of meetings with the corps, ''there's been no adequate improvement or resolution,'' and that he had ''sort of reached the breaking point.'' The timetable for increasing the pumping capacity keeps slipping, the senator said, and the situation ''has gone from unacceptable to much worse.'' The corps has been intensely focused on preventing a recurrence of the levee breaches that flooded New Orleans last year, which Mr. Vitter called ''the greatest stain on the history of the Corps of Engineers.'' As a result, he said, it has lost sight of the risks of flooding. While not as catastrophic as breaches, he said, ''significant flooding in thousands, or tens of thousands, of people's homes'' could be a crippling blow to the city's efforts to get back on its feet, and could drive even more residents away. Mr. Vitter suggested that the corps might be dragging its feet on the floodgates project because of a reluctance to pour money into a system that is supposed to be in place for only a few years until permanent pumping stations can be erected. Matt McBride, an engineer living in the Broadmoor neighborhood, said the corps's efforts to patch the hurricane protection system had fallen short. ''With the corps,'' Mr. McBride said, ''it's 'Look how hard we're working!' You're working hard, but you've lost sight of the objective. The objective is to keep us dry.'' Dwayne Anthony, another Broadmoor resident and a driver for UPS, said, ''I believe that mistakes were made'' by the corps, ''but I believe they learned from it,'' and have improved the system. ''I believe that in my heart,'' Mr. Anthony said. ''Otherwise, I wouldn't have come back from Houston.''"
"As the muddy, turbulent waters of the Chenango River rushed toward this city's downtown, Anton Lucas knew exactly what to do: Move the furniture and tools from the cellar to the first floor, grab some wine and a lawn chair, and sit on a patch of grass some 50 yards away, watching the water rise. Mr. Lucas, 54, left work early on Tuesday so he could prepare for the inevitable. His house, an elegant Tudor that sits just feet from where the Chenango and Susquehanna Rivers meet, had been flooded once before, he said, in April 2005, catching him by surprise. He lost $50,000 in clothes and furniture then. This time would be different. ''I've been partying all day,'' Mr. Lucas, a self-employed general contractor, said as night fell on Wednesday, still wearing the yellow T-shirt and shorts he had on the night before. ''All I can do right now is wait. Then I'll go fix the damage, just like I did before.'' Along the northern bank of the Susquehanna, from Binghamton to Johnson City and Endicott, two neighboring communities upriver, flooding spared hardly a home and thousands needed to be evacuated. In some cases, the water climbed front steps and flowed into kitchens and living rooms, looking like chocolate milk in a blender. Outside an apartment building on Riverside Drive, a blue toy car bobbed in the water while a man in galoshes carried two boxes on his shoulder up the front steps of a tidy brick house across the street. At Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital to the west, two doctors wheeled a woman into an ambulance, which then whisked her away to a hospital on dry, higher ground. Sharon Landon, 48, a nurse in the hospital's oncology hospice, said the river began to creep into the ground floor of Our Lady of Lourdes early in the morning and slowly inundated the cafeteria, pharmacy, lab and the hospital's power plant, which meant the electricity had to be shut down. For hours, she said, doctors and nurses worked to discharge the patients who were well enough to go home and prepare those in need of care for a quick move. ''I have water in my own cellar, three to four inches, I'm told,'' Ms. Landon said as she slogged out of work around 7 p.m. on Wednesday, her face glistening with sweat, and carrying a raincoat and galoshes in a ripped plastic bag. There was, however, a certain festive feel in the air, with children and adults biking and skating downhill, toward the river, just because that was the thing to do. Some people carried cameras and posed for photographs by the Memorial Street Bridge across the Susquehanna, which sat partly under water late on Wednesday. Lt. John P. Shea of the city's Police Department said that the city was no stranger to flooding, but that this was the worst he could remember. He predicted that the waters would rise until Thursday, and that more people might have to leave their homes. Then, ''just like last year, and in the years before that, the rivers will go back to their normal levels,'' Lieutenant Shea said, ''as if nothing this bad ever really happened.'' Correction: June 30, 2006, Friday Because of an editing error, an article in some copies yesterday about flooding in Binghamton, N.Y., misstated the relative position of Johnson City and Endicott, two neighboring cities that were also flooded. They are downriver, not upriver."
"Saying that the city must rely on itself, not Washington, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced a new evacuation plan yesterday that could move millions of people out of flooded areas in a severe storm. ''If you look at what happened there, the federal government just could not get resources to where they're needed quickly enough, and that's not really what they're good at,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at City Hall, referring to New Orleans. ''There are a variety of things the federal government can do. But in terms of day-to-day stuff, this city is and always will be self-reliant.'' Although New York may not seem at risk for the kind of devastation seen along the Gulf Coast, the city is especially vulnerable to flooding because of the angle created by Long Island and the New Jersey coastline. All five boroughs are at risk, Mr. Bloomberg said, and the most drastic plan calls for the evacuation of up to three million New Yorkers. Officials have divided the city into flood zones, with the areas for potential damage creeping inland with the rising intensity of a storm. A Category 1 hurricane could threaten neighborhoods along the Newtown Creek in Brooklyn and Queens, in Lower Manhattan, on the north and south Shores of Staten Island and in low-lying areas of the Bronx. In a Category 3 hurricane, the most severe to hit the New York area yet, flood waters could reach as far inland as central Brooklyn or to the northeast corner of Central Park, according to city maps. The Office of Emergency Management spent nine months reviewing the city's plan, which was last updated two years ago and had come under criticism from elected officials. The new plan, which officials said incorporates lessons from Katrina and will cost $30 million to put in place, is intended to ease the evacuation of vulnerable populations like the elderly and homebound and hospital patients and to expand shelter capacity. Officials are nearly tripling the number of evacuation centers to 65 from 23 and organizing them into a ''solar system,'' with each center acting as a coordination hub for 5 to 10 of the 509 shelters. Bloomberg officials say the two-tier system gives them flexibility in responding to an emergency, but critics say it is unnecessarily cumbersome. The system is to be operated by approximately 34,000 volunteers selected from among employees of the city's nonemergency agencies and would provide shelter for more than 600,000 people in the worst-case situation. In that event, the city would evacuate up to three million people, most of whom, officials assume, would stay with family or friends elsewhere. To ease traffic flow, the city would shut down nonemergency construction, use snow emergency traffic regulations, suspend street cleaning rules, ask the state to suspend tolls and public transportation fees and modify taxi regulations to allow for more passengers. Officials would increase subway and bus service in and out of flood zones and monitor health care facilities for their ability to evacuate. The list of evacuation centers is available on the city's Web site, www.nyc.gov/oem, or through its information line, 311. The city is also mailing a brochure to 300,000 homes in the most vulnerable areas, and is making it available at city offices. Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky of Westchester, who released a report in March that was critical of the city's old plan, said that the essential flaws remained unresolved. He said the plan still left too much of the responsibility to move people from nursing homes and hospitals with the facilities that house them, ''in spite of the fact that they told us they don't know how to do it.'' He also criticized the two-tier shelter system, saying that it could force people who live close to shelters to travel first to an intake center before being bused back to a shelter."
"Rain hammered the nation's capital on Sunday and Monday and filled the lowlands of eastern Maryland and northern Virginia, disrupting Amtrak service, flooding tunnels and a major subway station, drowning crops and knocking out power to government buildings. A total of 5.19 inches of rain was recorded at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Sunday, the National Weather Service reported. More storms were expected to pelt the saturated ground through Tuesday and into Wednesday, raising concerns that the Potomac River might have trouble containing the water later in the week. The deluge followed a long dry period, however, reducing the chances of river flooding. As the roar of the rain muffled even the sound of thunder, the storms knocked down a 100-year-old elm not far from the front door of the White House and closed the headquarters of the Internal Revenue Service, the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, forcing at least 3,000 employees to stay home. The National Archives, the National Gallery of Art, the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities and the National Zoo were also closed. In Maryland, the storms forced a celebration to evacuate from a recreation center in Chevy Chase and buried a mile-long stretch of a Silver Spring highway in mud. Part of the capital Beltway in Virginia was closed and air traffic in the region was delayed, forcing travelers aloft, on the rails and behind the wheel to wait, in some cases until early Tuesday, to get to their destinations. A spokesman for the Weather Service, Chris Vacarro, said a stationary weather front stretching from Northern Vermont to the Florida Panhandle had produced the storms and would continue to do so at least through Tuesday. Though the Washington metropolitan area was soaked, the weather there seemed like a heavy summer shower compared with the thorough lashing of the agricultural heart of the Eastern Shore in Maryland. ''The rain just came down with such intensity,'' said Wayne Robinson, director of emergency management for Dorchester County. ''We have reports of 11 inches Sunday, some as much as 15 inches over two days.'' Mr. Robinson added: ''It just kept going across the roads, and the asphalt is just washed away. The culverts, the big pipes over little streams, those were just washed completely out.'' He said that as many as 23 roads had been cut off and that at least as many had been reduced to one lane. ''There has been a lot of crop damage: cucumbers, sweet corn, wheat, soy beans,'' he said, expressing concern, too, over the area's thousands of chickens housed in rows of long, low coops. Edward J. McDonough, a spokesman for the Maryland Emergency Management Agency, said the small town of Federalsburg in Caroline County had been evacuated briefly as emergency workers checked the stability of a farm dam. In Maryland, power failures left the homes and businesses of more than 10,000 Pepco customers dark, and in Northern Virginia, 3,300 customers of Dominion Virginia Power were also without electricity. When Bill Hart, a partner and general manager at the Strosnider's hardware store in Bethesda, Md., arrived at work at 7 a.m. on Monday, he said, ''I already had five cars out there waiting for me, asking if we had sandbags.'' By 9:30 a.m., Mr. Hart said, pumping equipment was sold out. In some areas, driving was particularly perilous. In a wooded agricultural preserve in northern Montgomery County, Md., the county fire captain, Carl Mauney, joined a county police officer, Nick Augustine, to pull a woman from a small sedan that had been pinned against a guardrail by strong currents and was at danger of falling eight feet into a swollen creek. ''I put on a life jacket, a helmet and a throw-rope,'' Captain Mauney said. ''The water was pretty calm until I got close to her vehicle, then it was flowing strongly.'' With waters up to the car windows, the woman, at his urging, climbed out the driver's-side window. ''Then we walked maybe 10 or 15 feet through moving water and got on top of a little island,'' where they were safe, he said. That was one of several rescues in the northern part of the county during the next 24 hours, said Mr. Mauney, who broke off his account to leave on another emergency call."
"After a downpour flooded houses and stranded hundreds of motorists in Houston, residents and officials warily prepared for more rain, and Gov. Rick Perry sent National Guard troops and state equipment. The effects were most severe in the southeastern section of the metropolitan region, where Harris County emergency officials reported 10.7 inches of rain. Some 500 emergency calls were received, mostly from residents asking to be rescued from flooded vehicles, Mayor Bill White of Houston said. No deaths were reported. BILL DAWSON (NYT)"
"This is a village of growling stomachs and sharp cheekbones. The people here are surrounded by floodwaters that have drowned their animals, submerged their crops and swept away their homes. They are slowly starving, unable to sustain themselves on unripe fruit and filthy water. At the faintest hum of an outboard engine, some 200 villagers, essentially the entire mobile population of Yagloo, run to the banks of the swollen Shabelle River with empty baskets and expectant eyes, hoping for powdered milk, a few handfuls of grain, some malaria pills, anything. ''You! You! You!'' they yelled at a passing boat, which unfortunately on this Tuesday morning was carrying only journalists. ''Don't forget us.'' They held up mud-streaked palms and pointed to a darkening sky. More rain was on its way. The floods here are yet another installment of a nation in crisis. At a time when Somalia seems inexorably close to an all-out war with Ethiopia, with a destructive potential that could dwarf the countless deaths from the last 15 years of anarchy, a deluge has arrived, plunging Somalia's breadbasket underwater, creating the conditions for an extended famine and taking the area's woes to a whole new level. Experts say this has been the worst flood season in East Africa in 50 years, and hundreds of people have already drowned, starved, succumbed to waterborne diseases like cholera and malaria, or been eaten by crocodiles. The other day, not far from where Yagloo's children played on the riverbank, a set of unblinking yellow eyes hung just above the surface of the water. ''They are hungry, too,'' said Muhammad Ali Gnani, a local aid worker. He later pointed out a huge crocodile carcass rotting in the bush, sizzling with flies, that his guards shot after it had eaten a boy. Crocodile attacks have been a problem across East Africa, as the drenching rains have driven hundreds of thousands of people from their homes and left them exposed in rising river waters teeming with wild animals. Some people have refused to be rescued, like a group of herders in Ethiopia who were trapped on shrinking pieces of high land. They said they would rather die next to their cattle than live without them. Ethiopia alone has lost approximately 500 people to the rains. Many climatologists blame global warming for the erratic weather, which brought drought last year and left the earth as hard as concrete -- and as impervious. When the rains began to lash down, the water just pooled. In Yagloo, which is about 30 miles north of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, villagers are stranded on a thin spit of mud between the overflowing Shabelle and the lake where their homes used to be. The water, which is the creamy brown color of tea with milk, is so deep that in some places all you can see are the pointy tops of straw huts sticking out. A few flip-flops and plastic bags float by. When it starts to pour, people duck under plastic tarps, if they have them, or huddle in shivering groups beneath banana trees. Dinner is typically green bananas or boiled mangos. When it comes time to sleep, families curl up together in soggy blankets. The other day, two elders sat around talking about a way to persuade God to spare them more rain. ''If only we could sacrifice an animal,'' said Ahmed Mahmoud. Finishing the thought, Hussein Hassan said, ''But all our animals have drowned. His shoulder blades were so sharp that they nearly poked through the thin, wet shirt clinging to his back. The floods have already pushed people on the wobbly edge of survival past the point of no return. Yagloo's cornfields, part of Somalia's crucial Shabelle agricultural belt, are marinating in stinking water, which means no crops to eat, much less to sell, next year. In neighboring villages, it is the same, with piles of melons stacked alongside submerged roads, the fruit cracking open with rot and a crust of fuzzy white mold creeping out. ''No doubt about it,'' said Muhammad Fuje, an official with the World Health Organization in Somalia. ''Next year, there will be famine.'' This is not purely a natural disaster. Somalia has not had a functioning government since 1991, and one result has been a shamelessly neglected infrastructure. That includes a dam near the Shabelle that recently burst, unleashing a cascade that swept through villages and carried off several children in a swirl of brown murkiness. Few aid agencies have come to the rescue. Southern Somalia's reputation for chaos and bloodshed has scared off most foreign aid workers, leaving the bulk of relief efforts in the hands of a new Islamic administration that is increasingly distracted by the prospects of war with Ethiopia, its larger and more powerful neighbor. After the Islamists came to power in June, Ethiopia stepped up its support of a rival group of Somali leaders in Baidoa, a city farther inland. Recently, the two sides have been building up their armies. ''We're doing our best to help the flood people,'' said Abdulrahim Ali Modei, the Islamic courts information minister. ''But we need some help from God.'' So far it does not appear to have come. The rains started in September. They were supposed to stop by November, the end of a normal rainy season. But this year they are predicted to drum on through January. All this water has fed a wild beauty along the river. Huge mango trees lean over the water. Herons skim to a landing in the swamps. The light changes dramatically by the minute, shifting between intense sunshine and sudden, stormy darkness, as if a fickle someone controlled the whole sky with a dimmer switch. At the close of another long, wet day, a little boy with a hard round belly and no pants stood on Yagloo's riverbank fishing with a bare hook. ''The fish nibble,'' said one woman watching him. ''But they don't bite.''"
"A fierce storm that raked across the Pacific Northwest on Thursday night and Friday morning knocked out power to more than a million households and businesses, including half of the city of Seattle. At least four people were dead, and there were no promises that power would be fully restored soon. The storm, which brought heavy rain to Seattle and its suburbs and blizzard conditions in the mountains, shot wind gusts of up to 113 miles per hour through the Cascade Range and 69 m.p.h., a record, at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. It rumbled rooftops like a hurricane in many elevated areas. Trees fell on houses, schools closed, a major bridge across Lake Washington was temporarily shut down and acontinuing search for three climbers lost for nearly a week on Mount Hood in Oregon was delayed. The storm, generated by air rushing in behind a big low-pressure system that formed in the Pacific Ocean, followed a November that saw severe flooding from record rainfall, then record cold and then unexpected snow and ice. It seemed an exasperating highlight reel of extreme weather for many who lived through it. ''It's been nuts,'' said Alan Johnson, store director for the Quality Food Center in Seattle's Wallingford neighborhood, where customers shopped in silhouette under the limited light provided by a generator. With power minimal and coolers not cooling, Mr. Johnson directed workers to take boxes of boneless chicken breasts and other perishables ''to a store where they can keep it cold.'' Flights were delayed all day Friday at the Seattle-Tacoma airport, where a power disruption in the south terminal shut down the baggage system much of the morning. The Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, a main commuter route between Seattle and its suburbs east of Lake Washington, was closed for several hours after waves damaged the drawbridge. The Seattle Times said it published only about 13,000 print copies of the newspaper because power was lost overnight at its plant in Bothell, north of Seattle. The newspaper reported that four people died in the storm, including one woman who became trapped in her flooded basement on Thursday night. The wind and debris knocked out 64 major electrical feeder lines overnight in Seattle, compared with just one or two that were damaged in storms last month, said Peter Clarke, a spokesman for Seattle City Light, the main electrical utility. Two hospitals operated under generator power on Friday. Downtown Seattle, which has an underground grid, did not lose power. Puget Sound Energy, which supplies power to many of Seattle's suburbs, said about 700,000 of the utility's one million customers lost power. ''Our system was really hit, probably harder than it ever has been,'' said Martha Monfried, a spokeswoman for the utility. She said it could be ''days'' before power was restored to some areas. In Oregon, Sergeant Gerry Tiffany, a spokesman for the Hood River County Sheriff's Office, said high winds and heavy snow had slowed the search for three men missing on Mount Hood since Sunday. With skies clearing, he said mountain rescue teams planned a major push to the 11,249-foot summit on Saturday. At the Wallingford Station post office in Seattle, power was short, transactions were limited to cash and lines were long. Customers nonetheless waited in relatively good humor to mail holiday gifts and conduct other business. One of them, Dean Custis, 62, a jovial man of substantial circumference, said he was awake until at least 3:30 a.m. on Friday watching the winds rip through his neighborhood in North Seattle, Licton Springs. ''The top of my hot tub blew off,'' he said. ''So I just went out and sat in it.''"
"THE Federal Emergency Management Agency says that only 30 percent of the properties in high-risk areas of the Northeast are covered by flood insurance. Here is why owners of the other 70 percent, as well as owners of homes that may not be in high-risk areas, should think seriously about buying flood insurance. ''You need flood insurance simply because the standard homeowner's insurance policy does not cover flooding,'' said Butch Kinerney, a FEMA spokesman. For an owner to buy government-backed flood insurance, the community in which the property is situated must be one of about 20,100 that participate in the National Flood Insurance Program, created by Congress in 1968. Participating communities agree to prohibit construction in high-risk areas, or if construction is permitted, it must be done in a way that minimizes the potential for flood damage. (Requiring buildings to be constructed on elevated piers is one way to reduce the risk.) Mr. Kinerney explained that a property is considered to be in a flood hazard area if the risk of flooding in any given year is 1 percent or more. Flood hazard areas are designated on flood maps prepared by the federal government. And while federally backed lenders require borrowers in such areas to buy flood insurance when getting a mortgage, it is possible -- and sometimes prudent -- for owners in areas not at high risk to buy coverage. Jeanne Salvatore, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute in Manhattan, said that even though flood-plain maps are redrawn periodically, they don't always reflect changes in runoff patterns caused by development -- which can cause flooding in areas not previously considered high-risk. In fact, she said, about a quarter of all claims are for damage in areas not designated high-risk. And while people tend to think that the risk of flooding is minimal, particularly if they do not live in a flood hazard area, insurance industry statistics show that in many parts of the country a property owner is more likely to experience damage from flooding than from a fire. Ms. Salvatore said flood insurance covers direct physical losses caused by storms, flash floods, abnormal tidal surges, waves and the like. A flood policy provides two types of coverage: one for the building and another for its contents. The part of the policy that covers the building provides ''replacement cost'' coverage, she said; in other words, the policy will pay for replacing or repairing the structure at current prices. But contents coverage is ''actual cash value,'' which takes depreciation into account. The maximum amount of structure coverage available for one- to four-family homes is $250,000. The maximum amount of contents coverage is $100,000. It is not necessary to buy both forms of coverage. Aaron Stein, the owner of Norton & Siegel, an insurance agency in Babylon, N.Y., said that flood coverage was available through any licensed broker or agent. The cost of a policy for a home in a flood-hazard area starts at about $500 a year but can run as high as $1,000 to $1,500, depending on construction costs in the area. The cost of a policy in low- to moderate-risk areas can be as little as $112 a year. There is a 30-day waiting period before a policy takes effect; renters can buy contents coverage. ''If you're in a flood hazard area,'' Mr. Stein said, ''you have to be crazy not to have coverage. And if you're not in a flood zone, you can buy peace of mind for just a couple of hundred dollars a year.'' Owners and renters can find out more about flood insurance, including the risk of flooding and an estimate of the premiums, on a FEMA Web site: floodsmart.gov. YOUR HOME"
"Marilyn Haverty, whose house in Waveland, Miss., was buffeted by wind and surging water in Hurricane Katrina, thought her homeowner's insurance would cover at least the wind damage. But it never paid her a penny. As it turns out, Ms. Haverty's insurance policy, like nearly every one around the country, said, essentially, that if the house was damaged by a flood or earthquake or something else not covered, it did not matter that she had coverage for wind damage. There was no coverage at all. Since at least the mid-1980's, insurers have been putting into their home insurance policies ''anti-concurrent causation'' clauses that effectively eliminate coverage that insurers promise to provide when selling their policies. But most people skip over the legalistic language -- if they read their policies at all. And until Katrina, there had never been such an outpouring of challenges. ''There's no question that the anti-concurrent clause is bad for policyholders,'' said Adam F. Scales, an associate professor who teaches insurance law at the Washington and Lee University School of Law, in Lexington, Va. ''It's not fair because it defeats policyholders' reasonable expectations.'' Insurers counter that they need the clause to protect themselves from being drawn into paying for floods, earthquakes or mudslides and other widespread calamities that are beyond their scope and that they specifically refuse to cover. The insurance companies say they expect to pay out $17.6 billion for homes damaged in Katrina and $20.8 billion to businesses -- the most insurers have ever paid out in a catastrophe. But lawyers for homeowners say the insurers would have had to pay out perhaps billions more had it not been for the anti-concurrent clause. Industry officials said they had no comprehensive data, but acknowledged that a substantial amount of money was at stake. The provision has become one of the central issues in the thousands of lawsuits that have been filed against insurance companies since Hurricane Katrina hit last August. In the first trial, which began in July and is now awaiting a federal court judge's verdict, the homeowner's lawyer, Richard F. Scruggs, argued that the storm surge in Katrina was not a flood -- as defined by the insurance companies -- but an inseparable part of the hurricane. Mr. Scruggs also argued that his client, Paul Leonard, a police lieutenant, was told by his agent that he did not need to buy flood insurance. Mr. Scruggs contended that the anti-causation clause should be voided. The insurance companies say they paid for damage to homes in areas where there was no flooding. Where there was flooding, they say, they paid for damage that could have come only from wind, like the loss of a roof and broken upper-story windows -- above the highest marks left by flood waters. But they have generally refused to pay for damage to houses, or parts of houses, that were hit by both wind and flood water. ''They are sitting on this idea that the water washed everything away and whether there was any wind damage or not, they don't feel they have to provide any coverage,'' said Zach Butterworth, a lawyer in Bay St. Louis, Miss., who, with Mr. Scruggs, is representing Ms. Haverty and dozens of other storm victims. Courts around the country have been divided on whether the provision may be used to deny coverage. Many have backed the insurers. But other courts have sided with policyholders, concluding that the clause was ambiguous or ran counter to reasonable expectations of what was covered. ''It is not a settled issue,'' said E. Farish Percy, a law professor and insurance expert at the University of Mississippi. ''Courts that have decided in favor of plaintiffs are saying, 'It may be perfectly clear to an insurance lawyer, but it's not that clear to a policyholder.' '' Insurers and other insurance experts say the only way policyholders can protect themselves is to take on the additional expense of buying special government policies that cover floods and earthquakes. But that is only a partial remedy for more expensive homes that are flooded, because the federal government limits coverage for floods to $250,000. Earthquake insurance sold by California carries a high deductible. Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York, said the insurers priced their policies in the expectation that they would not be paying for damage in combination with flooding. Otherwise, Mr. Hartwig said, premiums would be much higher and some insurers might decide not to offer coverage on homes at all in certain areas. Without the provision, he said, ''if a home is destroyed by an excluded peril like flood, but the damage occurred in connection with another peril like wind, you'd effectively be saying that, in effect, flood coverage is provided.'' In papers filed in the first trial in Mississippi, the Nationwide Insurance Company said the anti-causation clause ''relieves insurers of the untenable task of proving a negative,'' that is, ''eliminating wind as a potential partial cause of the loss.'' Even homeowners who say they fully understood that flood coverage was provided only by the government and had to be bought separately say they expected to receive at least some compensation for wind damage since both wind and water harmed their homes. ''I thought I would get something,'' said Ms. Haverty, who retired in January as the assistant branch manager of a bank. During the storm, Ms. Haverty said, pine trees near her house were snapped off high above the ground by strong winds. But, she said, State Farm told her: ''No, we're not paying you anything on the wind. It was water.'' State Farm declined to discuss the case. Ms. Haverty was one of the relative few in Mississippi who had federal flood insurance, and she received $93,900 on that policy. Like many others whose insurers did not pay, she has applied for a federal grant. Congress has committed $15 billion to help with rebuilding for people who had no flood insurance or not enough and who received partial or no payment from their insurers. The insurers say they spell out their terms of coverage in their policies. But even lawyers representing insurance companies say customers do not always understand the limits of their coverage. ''When you look at anti-causation language, it just doesn't look that important,'' said Randy J. Maniloff, a lawyer at White & Williams in Philadelphia who represents commercial insurance companies but is following insurance developments along the Gulf Coast. ''They don't appear to be words of substance. But they're actually enormously important.'' In the Nationwide Insurance Company's home insurance policy, which is being debated in the Mississippi trial, the anti-concurrent language precedes a list of things not covered. ''We do not cover loss to any property resulting directly or indirectly from any of the following,'' the passage begins. ''Such a loss is excluded even if another peril or event contributed concurrently or in any sequence to cause the loss.'' The insurers point out that in most states, insurance regulators approve the language in their policies. But insurance experts said that was not necessarily a test for fairness or consumer protection. ''The regulators look a lot more carefully at rates than they do at policy terms,'' said Gary S. Thompson, a lawyer at Reed Smith in Washington who represents commercial policyholders but also follows home insurance issues. ''It's really the courts that cause insurance companies to go back and re-examine their coverage terms.'' In questions about the anti-concurrent clause at the Mississippi trial, John Griffin Jones, a colleague of Mr. Scruggs, raised the prospect of a tree theoretically crashing through the roof of a house and rain water pouring in. If nothing else happened, all the damage would be covered. But, Mr. Jones asked, if a storm surge came two hours later and flooded the house, would everything below the water line be excluded from coverage? ''Yes, sir,'' Jeffrey Kline Gilbert, an executive in charge of Katrina claims at Nationwide, replied. ''Under the anti-concurrent clause provision, right?'' Mr. Jones asked. ''Yes, sir.'' Then, Mr. Jones asked: ''How is a guy like Paul Leonard going to know that when he is buying one of these policies? How is he going to know it is going to get that technical that you have an anti-concurrent clause provision that if any water touches the property, he is on his own?'' ''First,'' Mr. Gilbert said, ''by reading the policy.''"
"As soon as the West Branch of the swollen Delaware River began to recede in early July, townspeople lugging rakes, shovels and wheelbarrows showed up at the county fairgrounds and went to work. Much like the rest of this town of 5,500 on the edge of the Catskill Mountains, the fair's 65-acre site had been underwater for four days and was covered with rocks, logs, branches and broken chairs that the flood had strewn. The Delaware County Fair is the area's largest and most lucrative event. Even with the inundation and destruction that came with 15 inches of rainfall over two days in late June, people here were not about to surrender their fair to the flood. ''This year, more than ever, we knew we had to have the fair,'' said John W. Meredith, the town supervisor. ''We had to do it for the mental health of our people, to give them hope for the future.'' The flood destroyed 35 percent of the county's crops, washed away a quarter of the active cropland and damaged 283 of its 600 farms, according to the most recent official tally. It is a staggering toll for Delaware County, which draws much of its economic sustenance from agriculture. Still, the fair opened here on Sunday, its 120th consecutive year here, and thousands have come this week to show their animals, brave the rides, savor funnel cake and apple dumplings, and trade stories that more often than not revolve around the flood and its aftermath. Last year, 80,000 people attended the fair, and this year's attendance is on track to match that number, officials said. Young men in cowboy hats, babies in strollers, sunburned farmers, the elderly and the frail ambled along the fair's labyrinthian dirt paths, past the tattoo tent, the London broil sandwich stand and the trailer that sells T-shirts emblazoned with the phrase ''We Survived the Flood of 2006.'' The fair's director, Gary Tweedie, a jolly 64-year-old who works as a used-car auctioneer, said that there were 150 commercial tents, and that 1,200 heads of cattle were vying for ribbons at the fair, which ends Saturday. There are four tigers in a cage and a sculptor who carves animals out of butter inside a refrigerated room. A pig and its litter lay on a pile of hay at the end of a long barn, delighting the children who pass by. A demolition derby drew a boisterous crowd on Monday, and was expected to do the same again on Friday night. Walking around the grounds, the smell of fried dough permeated the air. ''There's a lot of money spent here, and there's a lot of fun to be had,'' Mr. Tweedie said as he strolled past a pancake griddle stand teeming with patrons at lunchtime. ''Everybody who was born or brought up in Delaware County and who moved away come back every year to visit the fair. It's like a big family reunion.'' The fair employs dozens of local teenagers, who sell tickets, serve food and direct traffic in the parking lot. Many of them worked along with 200 volunteers to pick up the debris that the floodwater scattered around the barns and grandstand. Inmates from the Summit Shock Incarceration Correctional Facility, a state prison about 45 miles west of Albany, spent a week here filling in craters around the fairgrounds. Ten juvenile offenders living at a residential treatment center nearby toiled for three weeks to rebuild the fences around the demolition derby track. Beneath the smiles that greet visitors in the barn stalls, food stands and craft shops, there is a whiff of sadness and a shadow of uncertainty. Theron Howland, 61, a beef farmer who was tending to his bull, Sammy, at his stall, calculated that he would need at least $10,000 just to start the repairs on his damaged barns. Like many farmers in this area, he did not have flood insurance. He acknowledged that he has been short-tempered since the flood and finds himself crying for no reason. ''I'm so depressed, I feel like giving up sometimes,'' Mr. Howland said. ''If it wasn't for my children, I would have just sold the farm.'' At the dairy barn, Donald M. Smith sat beside his wife, Janice, on the wood bleachers and watched the farmers, many of whom he knows, lead their prized cows into the show ring. Mr. Smith, 69, had displayed his own cattle at the fair since 1947, save for a 7-year hiatus after the birth of his first two daughters. But not this time. The flood ravaged his dairy farm, which his grandfather bought in 1898. ''We had too many losses,'' Mr. Smith said hesitantly as a teardrop emerged from behind his bifocal glasses and rolled down his cheek. He said he had to dump 2,200 pounds of milk that spoiled before it could be taken to market. Four of his young cows drowned as they tried to escape the surging waters of a creek, and he lost 50 acres of crops, mostly corn that was to be used to feed the cattle in the winter. ''I just couldn't afford to bring the animals to the fair,'' Mr. Smith said. David and Elaine Holley, who own a dairy farm just outside this town, said their cows had water up to their bellies in the barns, which were left with about a foot of mud after the waters receded. Their pasture is buried under three feet of gravel, so the Holleys said they took 17 heifers and calves to a neighbor's pasture to stay until the end of the summer. It will take two years for them to fully repair their land, Mr. Holley said. Moments later, his 17-year-old son, Kyle, led a heifer named Trinity to victory at a showmanship competition in the dairy barn ring. ''It's little things like this that put a smile on your face,'' Mr. Holley said after the win."
"A federal judge in Mississippi sided with home insurance companies yesterday and ruled that they did not have to pay for the flooding that destroyed tens of thousands of homes in Hurricane Katrina. Insurers have already paid $17.6 billion for damage to homes from Katrina that was attributed to wind only. But this was a victory for the companies, because they could have been forced to pay out untold billions more if they had been required to cover damage from flooding caused by the storm. Several hundred thousand homes were damaged or destroyed by Katrina. It was not a total victory, however. The judge rejected attempts by the insurers to cancel coverage for wind damage when it occurred in combination with the flooding. That aspect of his decision, in the first trial over disputed claims of damage from the hurricane, favored storm victims and could cost the insurers hundreds of millions of dollars. Now homeowners whose claims have been denied may have the opportunity to present proof in court that at least some of the damage resulted from wind -- which is the main protection provided by home insurance policies in hurricanes. For the couple who brought the lawsuit, Paul and Julie Leonard of Pascagoula, Miss., the ruling means that they will receive about $3,000 to cover damage to their home, rather than the more than $130,000 they had sought. But their lawyer, Richard F. Scruggs, said the ruling was ''going to open the door for recovery for thousands of Mississippi homeowners.'' Lawyers for both the insurers and the plaintiffs saw good news in the decision. ''We're gratified that the major provisions of the standard homeowners insurance policy were upheld,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York. Mr. Hartwig said the issue of paying for combined wind and water damage ''will probably be the subject of further judicial review.'' Mr. Scruggs said he disagreed with the decision that exempted insurers from flood coverage in general. But he said the ruling against the insurers had ''so much upside for the homeowners on the Gulf'' of Mexico. Homeowners and the insurance industry had watched the case closely as the first test of whether insurers are responsible for paying for damages caused by both wind and water. The insurers had claimed their policies ruled out coverage for flooding. Lawyers representing homeowners argued that in selling home insurance with many references to windstorms and hurricanes, the insurance companies led customers to believe that any hurricane damage -- from wind or water -- would be covered. The ruling therefore upholds a longstanding practice of insurers of not covering flood damage, which is typically insured through the federal government. The ruling, by Judge L. T. Senter Jr. of Federal District Court in Gulfport, applied directly to Nationwide Mutual Insurance, which had been sued by the Leonards. Judge Senter presided over the trial as judge and jury. He is also presiding over nearly all of the hundreds of lawsuits that are pending in federal court in Gulfport over insurance claims from Hurricane Katrina. His ruling in the Nationwide case is expected to guide his handling of the other disputes. Hundreds of other cases are pending in state court. ''For other judges hearing these cases, this is obviously going to be the most important decision they look to,'' said Adam F. Scales, who teaches insurance law at the Washington and Lee University School of Law. Randy J. Maniloff, a lawyer who represents insurance companies, said that while many would see the verdict as a victory for insurers, ''Judge Senter has also laid the groundwork for homeowners to do very well in these cases.'' Judge Senter said Nationwide's home insurance policy was clear in its refusal to cover flood damage. But he said the section that asserted that Nationwide had no liability for either wind or water damage when they occurred in combination or within a few hours of each other was ambiguous. In earlier, less definitive rulings, Judge Senter found that similar language in the policies of State Farm and Allstate, which are fighting hundreds of their own lawsuits, was also ambiguous. ''The judge rejected the most extreme position offered by both sides,'' Mr. Scales said. ''The position that storm surge or hurricane flooding is covered was never very plausible. But it was just as implausible that if there is any water involved, the insurers don't have to pay anything.'' In his ruling yesterday, Judge Senter said that the wind damage was covered ''even if the wind damage occurred concurrently or in sequence with the excluded water damage.'' Judge Senter said most of the damage to the Leonards' home in Pascagoula was the result of flooding, and thus Nationwide was not required to pay the full amount the Leonards were demanding. Nationwide had paid the Leonards $1,661.17 for wind damage. Judge Senter said that, because of what he determined to be additional wind damage, they were entitled to another $1,228.16. ''We didn't bring home the full measure of damages for the Leonard family,'' Mr. Scruggs said. ''But they cleared a big path for all the other homeowners on the Gulf Coast.'' In the Nationwide lawsuit, Mr. Scruggs, representing the Leonards, asserted that his clients had been misled by their insurance agent. Mr. Leonard testified that the agent had told him that he did not need to buy flood insurance from the federal government. Mr. Scruggs argued that Mr. Leonard, a police lieutenant, had reasonably concluded that his home insurance policy provided everything he needed to protect him in a hurricane. But Judge Senter said that while he believed that the agent had advised against buying flood insurance, he did not agree that the agent had, in effect, verbally expanded the coverage of the home insurance policy to include flood damage. Nationwide said that it was ''very pleased'' by the decision. It did not comment on Judge's Senter's ruling that some of the language in its policies was ambiguous and that claims for wind damage could not be rejected merely because the damage had occurred in combination with flooding. The company said it would ''continue to adjust claims on a case-by-case basis.'' The ruling, it added, ''underscores just how important it is for all policyholders to carefully read and understand the terms of the coverage they purchase.'' The insurance industry had argued that a ruling requiring insurers to pay all flood damage would have meant that their policies or contracts could be rewritten by the courts, and might have led some of them to withdraw from the home insurance business."
"A flash flood in Ethiopia swept away houses, factories and dozens of people over the weekend, killing at least 191, with 300 more still missing, officials said Monday. The flood hit early Sunday morning in Dire Dawa, in eastern Ethiopia, when many people were still sleeping. Dozens living in riverside shacks were instantly washed away when the Dechatu River, which bisects the town, burst its banks, authorities said. As the riverbanks collapsed, dozens more were buried alive in an avalanche of sand. On Monday, rescue workers dug with bulldozers, military trucks, shovels and their bare hands, trying to locate survivors. Ethiopian authorities said 191 bodies had been found. Many of the casualties were children. ''Whole families were lost, factories were lost, so many people died while they were sleeping,'' said Jemal Ali, a member of the Dire Dawa local government. ''We've had floods before, but nothing like this.'' Dire Dawa lies on a dry, crumbly desert shelf about 300 miles east of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital. Each summer, during the rainy season, the Dechatu and Dire Dawa Rivers swell with runoff from Ethiopia's highlands. Last year, the waters topped their banks and more than 20 people drowned. On Sunday, the rainfall was so heavy that the water surged over the riverbanks, knocking down houses and telephone poles. ''I opened the door, the water burst in, forcing me to escape to the rooftop,'' a survivor, Abaye Baheru, told Agence France-Presse. ''I saw men, women and children being washed away while crying for help.'' Mr. Ali said that huge coffee factories had simply vanished and that the amount of property destroyed was staggering. ''This is a catastrophe,'' he said. More than 300,000 people live in the Dire Dawa area. Mr. Ali said the government was trying to find survivors, bury the dead and relocate thousands of people, all at the same time."
"The quest for water can drive a woman mad. Ask Ritu Prasher. Every day, Mrs. Prasher, a homemaker in a middle-class neighborhood of this capital, rises at 6:30 a.m. and begins fretting about water. It is a rare morning when water trickles through the pipes. More often, not a drop will come. So Mrs. Prasher will have to call a private water tanker, wait for it to show up, call again, wait some more and worry about whether enough buckets are filled in the bathroom in case no water arrives. ''Your whole day goes just planning how you'll get water,'' a weary Mrs. Prasher, 45, recounted one morning this summer, cellphone in hand and ready to press redial for the water tanker. ''You become so edgy all the time.'' In the richest city in India, with the nation's economy marching ahead at an enviable clip, middle-class people like Mrs. Prasher are reduced to foraging for water. Their predicament testifies to the government's astonishing inability to deliver the most basic services to its citizens at a time when India asserts itself as a global power. The crisis, decades in the making, has grown as fast as India in recent years. A soaring population, the warp-speed sprawl of cities, and a vast and thirsty farm belt have all put new strains on a feeble, ill-kept public water and sanitation network. The combination has left water all too scarce in some places, contaminated in others and in cursed surfeit for millions who are flooded each year. Today the problems threaten India's ability to fortify its sagging farms, sustain its economic growth and make its cities healthy and habitable. At stake is not only India's economic ambition but its very image as the world's largest democracy. ''If we become rich or poor as a nation, it's because of water,'' said Sunita Narain, director of the Center for Science and Environment in New Delhi. Conflicts over water mirror the most vexing changes facing India: the competing demands of urban and rural areas, the stubborn divide between rich and poor, and the balance between the needs of a thriving economy and a fragile environment. New Delhi's water woes are typical of those of many Indian cities. Nationwide, the urban water distribution network is in such disrepair that no city can provide water from the public tap for more than a few hours a day. An even bigger problem than demand is disposal. New Delhi can neither quench its thirst, nor adequately get rid of the ever bigger heaps of sewage that it produces. Some 45 percent of the population is not connected to the public sewerage system. Those issues are amplified nationwide. More than 700 million Indians, or roughly two-thirds of the population, do not have adequate sanitation. Largely for lack of clean water, 2.1 million children under the age of 5 die each year, according to the United Nations. The government says that 9 out of 10 Indians have access to the public water supply, but that may include sources that are going dry or are contaminated. The World Bank, in rare agreement with Ms. Narain, warned in a report published last October that India stood on the edge of ''an era of severe water scarcity.'' ''Unless dramatic changes are made -- and made soon -- in the way in which government manages water,'' the World Bank report concluded, ''India will have neither the cash to maintain and build new infrastructure, nor the water required for the economy and for people.'' The window to address the crisis is closing. Climate change is expected only to exacerbate the problems by causing extreme bouts of weather -- heat, deluge or drought. A River of Waste The fabled Yamuna River, on whose banks this city was born more than 2,000 years ago, is a case study in the water management crisis confronting India. In Hindu mythology, the Yamuna is considered to be a river that fell from heaven to earth. Today, it is a foul portrait of crippled infrastructure -- and yet, still worshiped. From the bridges that soar across the river, the faithful toss coins and sweets, lovingly wrapped in plastic. They scatter the ashes of their dead. In New Delhi the Yamuna itself is clinically dead. As the Yamuna enters the capital, still relatively clean from its 246-mile descent from atop the Himalayas, the city's public water agency, the New Delhi Jal Board, extracts 229 million gallons every day from the river, its largest single source of drinking water. As the Yamuna leaves the city, it becomes the principal drain for New Delhi's waste. Residents pour 950 million gallons of sewage into the river each day. Coursing through the capital, the river becomes a noxious black thread. Clumps of raw sewage float on top. Methane gas gurgles on the surface. It is hardly safe for fish, let alone bathing or drinking. A government audit found last year that the level of fecal coliform, one measure of filth, in the Yamuna was 100,000 times the safe limit for bathing. In 1992, a retired Indian Navy officer who once sailed regattas on the Yamuna took his government to the Supreme Court. The retired officer, Sureshwar D. Sinha, charged that the state had killed the Yamuna and violated his constitutional right, as a practicing Hindu, to perform ritual baths in the river. Since then, the Supreme Court ordered the city's water authority to treat all sewage flowing into the river and improve water quality. In 14 years, that command is still unmet. New Delhi's population, now 16 million, has expanded by roughly 41 percent in the last 15 years, officials estimate. As the number of people living -- and defecating -- in the city soars, on average more than half of the sewage they pour into the river goes untreated. A government audit last year indicted the Jal Board for having spent $200 million and yielding ''very little value.'' The construction of more sewage treatment plants has done little to stanch the flow, in part because sewage lines are badly clogged and because power failures leave them inoperable for hours at a time. ''It has not improved at all because the quantity of sewage is constantly increasing,'' said R. C. Trivedi, a director of the Central Pollution Control Board, which monitors the quality of the Yamuna River. ''The gap is continually widening.'' Making matters worse, many New Delhi neighborhoods, like Janata Colony -- Hindi for People's Colony -- are not even connected to sewage pipes. Open sewers hem the narrow lanes of the slum. Every alley carries their stench. Some canals are so clogged with trash and sludge that they are no more than green-black ribbons of muck. It is a mosquitoes' paradise. Malaria and dengue fever are regular visitors. Not long ago, a 2-year-old boy named Arman Mustakeem fell into one such canal and drowned. His parents said they found him floating in the open sewer in front of their home. These canals empty into a wide storm drain. It, in turn, runs through the eastern edges of the city, raking in more sewage and cascades of trash, before it merges with effluent from two sewage treatment plants, and finally, enters the Yamuna. Carrying the capital's waste on its back, the Yamuna meanders south to cities like Mathura and Agra, home to the Taj Mahal. It is their principal source of drinking water, too. New Delhi's downstream neighbors are forced to treat the water heavily, hiking up the cost. With New Delhi slated to host the Commonwealth Games in 2010, the government proposes to remake this riverfront with a sports and recreation complex. In the meantime, the Yamuna, vital and befouled as it is, bears the weight of New Delhi's ambitions. At dawn each morning, men sink into the still, black waters to retrieve whatever can be bartered or sold: rings from a dead man's finger, coins dropped by the faithful, the remnants of rubber sandals, plastic water bottles. The dhobis, who launder clothes, line up on one stretch of riverbank, pounding saris and bedsheets on stone tablets. A man shovels sand from the river bottom: every bullock cart he fills for a cement maker will fetch him a coveted $5.50. Men and boys bathe. ''This river is worshiped,'' said a bewildered Sunny Verma, 24. ''Is this the right way of worshiping it?'' So shaken was Mr. Verma on his first visit to the Yamuna this year that he now works full time to shake up others. He joined an environmental group called We for Yamuna. ''If you want to worship the river, you should give it more respect,'' he said. ''You should treat it the right way. You should question the government. You should ask the state to actually do something for the river.'' Deluge and Drought Mrs. Prasher has the misfortune of living in a neighborhood on New Delhi's poorly served southern fringe. As the city's water supply runs through a 5,600-mile network of battered public pipes, 25 to 40 percent leaks out. By the time it reaches her, there is hardly enough. On average, she gets no more than 13 gallons a month from the tap and a water bill from the water board that fluctuates from $6 to $20, at its whimsy, she complains, since there is never a meter reading anyway. That means she has to look for other sources, scrimp and scavenge to meet her family's water needs. She buys an additional 265 gallons from private tankers, for roughly $20 a month. On top of that she pays $2.50 toward the worker who pipes water from a private tube-well she and other residents of her apartment block have installed in the courtyard. Nearly a fourth of New Delhi households, according to the government commissioned Delhi Human Development Report, rely at least in some part on such wells. It is one of the principal reasons groundwater in New Delhi is drying up faster than virtually anywhere in the country: 78 percent of it is considered overexploited. Still, the new posh apartment buildings sprouting across New Delhi and its suburbs sell themselves by ensuring a 24-hour water supply -- usually by drilling wells deep underground. ''Imagine never being thirsty for water,'' boasts a newspaper advertisement for one new development. Warning of ''an unparalleled water crisis,'' the study released in August found that 25 percent of New Delhi households had no access to piped water, and that 27 percent got water for less than three hours a day. Nearly two million households, the report also found, had no toilet. The daily New Delhi hustle for water only adds to the strains on the public system. A few years ago, for instance, to compensate for the low water pressure in the public pipeline, Mrs. Prasher and her neighbors began tapping directly into the public water main with so-called booster pumps, each one sucking out as much water as possible. It was a me-first approach to a limited and unreliable public resource, and it proliferated across this me-first city, each booster pump further draining the water supply. The situation for New Delhi, and all of India, is only expected to worsen. India now uses an estimated 829 billion cubic yards of water every year -- that is more than guzzling an entire Lake Erie. But its water needs are growing by leaps. By 2050, official projections indicate, demand will more than double, and exceed the 1.4 trillion cubic yards that India has at its disposal. Yet the most telling paradox of the city's water crisis is that New Delhi is not entirely lacking in water. The problem is distribution, hampered by a feeble infrastructure and a lack of resources, concedes Arun Mathur, chief executive of the Jal Board. The Jal Board estimates that consumers pay no more than 40 percent of the actual cost of water. Raising the rates is unrealistic for now, as Mr. Mathur well knows. ''It would be easier to ask people to pay up more if we can make water abundantly available,'' he said. A proposal to privatize water supply in some neighborhoods met with stiff opposition last year and was dropped. So the city's pipe network remains a punctured mess. That means, like most everything else in this country, some people have more than enough, and others too little. The slums built higgledy-piggledy behind Mrs. Prasher's neighborhood have no public pipes at all. The Jal Board sends tankers instead. The women here waste their days waiting for water, and its arrival sets off desperate wrestling in the streets. Kamal Krishnan quit her job for the sake of securing her share. Five days a week, she would clean offices in the next neighborhood. Five nights a week, she would go home to find no water at home. The buckets would stand empty. Finally, her husband ordered her to quit. And wait. ''I want to work, but I can't,'' she said glumly. ''I go mad waiting for water.'' Elsewhere, in the central city, where the nation's top politicians have their official homes, the average daily water supply is three times what finally arrives even in Mrs. Prasher's neighborhood. Mrs. Prasher rations her water day to day as if New Delhi were a desert. She uses the leftover water from the dog bowl to water the plants. She recycles soapy water from the laundry to mop the balcony. And even when she gets it, the quality is another question altogether. Her well water has turned salty as it has receded over the years. The water from the private tanker is mucky-brown. Still, Mrs. Prasher says, she can hardly afford to reject it. ''Beggars can't be choosers,'' she said. ''It's water.''

"High winds knocked down trees, created powerful waves and blew down utility lines yesterday, interrupting electricity to more than 200,000 homes and businesses as the remnants of Tropical Storm Ernesto swept through the region. Wind gusts of up to 35 miles an hour delayed some arriving flights at Kennedy International Airport for up to five and a half hours last night and for three hours at Newark Liberty International Airport on the busy Labor Day weekend, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airports. La Guardia Airport had no weather-related delays last night. On the last holiday weekend of summer, some beaches were virtually deserted except for a handful of intrepid surfers wearing wet suits enjoying 12-foot-high swells during a brisk, overcast day. Swimming was banned at several beaches on Long Island because of rip currents, according to The Associated Press. Ernesto was reduced to an area of rain over western New York State and the lower Great Lakes yesterday, after drenching Virginia and North Carolina with up to a foot on its run up the East Coast. The Associated Press reported that the storm caused flooding that forced hundreds of people out of their homes and at least four deaths were blamed on the storm in Virginia, and one in North Carolina. Flooding was still a problem yesterday in North Carolina, where the Northeast Cape Fear River was more than five feet above flood stage and not expected to crest until today, the National Weather Service said. The storm forced most play at the U.S. Open in Queens to be postponed until today, including matches involving Andy Roddick, Maria Sharapova and Andre Agassi. Some areas of Westchester County suffered flooding, but there were no reported storm-related deaths in the region. Several areas prone to flooding, including Broome and Delaware Counties avoided significant damage, law enforcement officials said. While only about one-quarter inch of rain fell on the city, according to the National Weather Service, the wind wreaked havoc. Umbrellas were turned inside out, cars on bridges swayed and at times, rain fell sideways and trees fell on cars. More than 60,000 customers lost power in New York City and Westchester County, with half of those outages in Westchester, said Martha Liipfert, spokeswoman for Consolidated Edison. By yesterday evening, about 40,000 homes and businesses remained without electricity, Ms. Liipfert said. In New Jersey, about 80,000 customers lost power at some point in the day, with most of those in the northern portion of the state. By last night, 27,800 homes and businesses remained without electricity -- all but 3,000 in the northeastern part of the state. The hardest hit areas were Teaneck, Bergenfield and New Millford, said Terry Moran, spokesman for a New Jersey utility company. In Connecticut, about 50,000 customers lost power, and on Long Island, about 34,000 customers, utility officials said."
"LAST Sunday, as I walked through my woods in Maryland, I took note of the Japanese barberry beginning to show up beneath the oaks and sycamores. Japanese honeysuckle and multiflora rose are rampant there, too, of course. But now there are newcomers, like the shrubs linden viburnum (Viburnum dilatatum), so popular for its bright red berries, and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia), whose silvery gray leaves and fragrant blossoms used to enchant me -- until I saw it fruiting, along with the linden, at the edge of the woods and in roadside ravines. I have nothing against exotic plants, but I would prefer that they not jump the garden fence. When a plant expands too forcefully, taking light, water and nutrients from less aggressive natives, I don't plant it in my garden. Yet what do I see when I go to my local nursery? Japanese barberry, half price, for fall planting. Winged euonymous, or burning bush, is another widely available, and often invasive, plant. There are reasons these plants are popular: they tend to be tough and easy to grow, and they thrive in degraded, compacted soil. Some, like barberry, are full of berries or seeds easily spread by birds and animals. Prolific seed production is one attribute of an invasive plant. But so is the ability to grow quickly, to leaf out early or to stay in leaf longer, any of which allows the plant to shade out others and gives it a competitive edge. A few native plants, like black locust, can be invasive. But native plants are usually kept in check by other native species, which have been their partners in evolution. Exotics, on the other hand, often have no predators or diseases to slow their spread. A new guide from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, ''Native Alternatives to Invasive Plants,'' by C. Colston Burrell, published this month, clarifies why plants can be invasive in one area but not in another. (It is $8.95 at the botanic garden shop or by mail; bbg.org or 718-623-7286). Mr. Burrell, a landscape designer who also teaches about plants and ecology at the University of Virginia, champions native substitutes for barberry like New Jersey tea (Ceanothus americanus), a mounding shrub with clusters of white flowers in spring and golden foliage in fall, or Virginia sweetspire (Itea virginica), with fragrant white spires that bloom in midsummer and fall leaves that turn crimson, burgundy and purple. That doesn't mean he has no feeling for exotics. His garden, 16 miles northwest of Charlottesville, Va., is stuffed with hellebores, daphnes, viburnums and buddleia (butterfly bush), none of them native. But he keeps a close eye on anything that spreads. ''We've known for years that buddleia is invasive in the Northwest, but it's also escaping quite a bit here,'' Mr. Burrell said. Its seed moves easily on wind and water, he said, and flourishes in very rocky soil, ''often out of cracks, railroad lines, industrial sites.'' For East Coast gardeners, he suggests cephalanthus, or buttonbush, which has fragrant little fuzzy flowers; for those on the West Coast, Ceanothus thyrsiflorus, wild lilac, which has showy blue flowers. Both, like buddleia, are great butterfly attractors. Mr. Burrell pointed out, to my surprise, that privet is also invasive, particularly in flood plains, from small streams to major rivers. ''I've seen it spreading from the suburbs of Washington, D.C., on down to east-central Texas, where nothing else grows in the bottomlands for miles,'' he said. Linden viburnum, on the other hand, has found a very different niche, in mature beech forests. In place of linden viburnum, Mr. Burrell suggests red chokeberry (Aronia arbutifolia), which has white flowers in spring and red berries that persist through winter. If it is planted in the sun, its leaves turn a spectacular fiery orange-red in the fall. Or he recommends scarlet elder, Sambucus racemosa var. racemosa (pubens), which bears creamy yellow flowers in spring and scarlet berries in fall. Despite its reasonable tone, ''Native Alternatives to Invasive Plants'' raises a red flag for Peter Del Tredici, a botanist and senior scientist at the Arnold Arboretum in Jamaica Plain, Mass., who argues that tough exotic plants are the perfect denizens of the urban environment, which has been so disturbed that it has no natural ecosystem. Euonymus and berberis (Japanese barberry) ''are the parking lot plants par excellence,'' said Mr. Del Tredici, who teaches about plants and ecology at Harvard. ''If you compact the soil,'' he said, ''all you can really grow is euonymus.'' So-called natural woodlands, he added, have had centuries of disturbance from logging. And native plants have been hurt by pests, acid rain and the warming of temperatures. The invasives, he said, have moved into the void and flourished. ''They are symptoms of environmental degradation,'' he said. ''But I call it blaming the victim.'' Mr. Del Tredici is not against removing invasive species that are threatening a rare species in some natural area and replacing them with natives. But pulling invasives out of parks, he argues, is going against evolution. ''Trying to hold onto something that no longer exists -- 'The way God created it in 1492 is the way it should stay' -- well, that isn't possible,'' he said. ''So why even make it a goal?'' But Mr. Burrell argues that even places that are not truly wild have a plant history that means something and should be preserved. ''I remember the forest before these invasives,'' he said. ''So as long as there's a collective memory of what used to be, most people aren't willing to go watch a flood plain of Virginia bluebells and spring beauties turn into a monoculture of privet.'' Many states now list plants that are invasive to their areas, and some are moving to ban the propagation and sale of specific plants. Purple loosestrife, for example, will be banned in Minnesota by 2009. Winged euonymus (Euonymus alatus), Mr. Burrell noted, is spreading from New Hampshire to Michigan, south to the Carolinas and Tennessee, west to Iowa and Montana. ''It's time for nurseries to stop selling these plants,'' he said. CUTTINGS"
"Heavy rains destroyed homes, killed livestock and washed out roads through the middle of Baja California, officials said Sunday, as Tropical Storm John continued its advance up the peninsula. Nobody had died from the storm, but many were left homeless in the northern part of the state of Baja California Sur, which covers the southern portion of the peninsula. ''It has rained more than ever before in our history,'' said José Gajón de la Toba, the state's civil protection director. Mr. Gajón said it was still too early to estimate how many people had lost their homes in the storm. Many homes made of plywood and tar paper were flooded or destroyed. Crops were destroyed and cows, goats and sheep died in the storm, he said. President Vicente Fox was expected to visit the region and tour La Paz, a city of 150,000 where the storm did serious damage. Navy helicopters were to fly food and water to the most isolated regions. The state's highways were spared but local roads were ''in pieces,'' cutting off small communities, Mr. Gajón said. The hardest-hit regions of the state were the counties of Loreto, Comondú, and Mulegé. The storm approached the peninsula from the southwest on Thursday as the strongest hurricane to threaten the region in recent memory. It spared the coastal resort of Los Cabos on Friday as it shifted to the east and its winds weakened as it traveled up the peninsula. Much of the state's telephone communication was cut off Sunday because the storm had damaged lines to the rest of the country. Electricity service and cellular phone service were out in much of the state. By Sunday night, the storm was still dumping rain on the arid peninsula and threatening flash floods. The United States' national hurricane center in Miami said that up to 6 inches of rain was expected, with as much as 18 inches in some places. The storm was downgraded to a tropical depression on Sunday evening. By 8 p.m., centered 80 miles northwest of Santa Rosalía, its strongest winds had dissipated to 35 miles an hour. Forecasters said it would continue to move north along the east coast of Baja, bringing heavy rains to northern Baja and Southern California. The airport serving Los Cabos reopened Saturday and was jammed with tourists on Sunday trying to catch flights out of the beach towns, which remained shuttered. While the storm spoiled some vacations, it destroyed the homes of many employees at large hotels. The mayor of Los Cabos, Luis Armando Díaz, told The Associated Press that the hurricane had damaged homes and cut off the highway between his town and La Paz. The authorities reported flood waters had swept one man away in a car on Saturday in La Paz, but he was found alive hours later, clinging to a branch in the middle of a stream."
"Strings of bright laundry hang among the gravestones and people who are brave enough sleep among the dead, taking refuge on the high ground of the Karet cemetery from the worst flooding in Jakarta in decades. The skies were clear Tuesday but stagnant water filled nearly half the city's streets and more than 220,000 people remained homeless after several days of torrential rains and overflowing rivers. The water level dropped in some areas and officials said that more than 100,000 people had returned from government shelters to their homes. But electricity and water supplies had not been restored to much of this city of 12 million people. As of late Tuesday, the death toll for greater Jakarta had risen to 44, said the city's police spokesman, Col. I Ketut Untung Yoga Ana. Tens of thousands of people who chose not to evacuate remained stranded on upper floors, receiving government food deliveries by boat. For several hundred evacuees, the cemetery offered a refuge with public toilets and water pumps for laundry. An informal community has emerged, with women cooking donated food at a communal fire under a big blue tarpaulin. Siti Amina, 23, who fled chest-high floodwaters on Thursday night with her 4-year-old daughter in her arms, has settled into what could be a lengthy stay. The tiny home she shares with 10 other people remained almost entirely under water. She and her husband, Saefullah, 25, who sells fried bananas and fish cakes, do not know when they will be able to return. ''We are afraid to sleep in the cemetery,'' Ms. Siti said, ''but we have no other place to go. We are sleeping among the dead.'' In the daytime, the cemetery is a lively place as displaced people from surrounding neighborhoods come to use its conveniences. Children run and shout as clusters of mourners gather to bury their dead. On Tuesday, at least two of the burials were of people who had died of illnesses on the upper stories of flooded houses. Iim, 48, said she had found shelter, like many people, in a mosque and had come to the cemetery to wash her clothes and visit friends. ''I wouldn't spend the night here if you paid me,'' she said. There were no reports of the outbreaks of serious disease that had been feared, but officials said there were shortages of clean water, medicine and baby food. In the Tanah Abang neighborhood across town from the cemetery, the military operations officer, Capt. Toar Johanes Pioh, said 8,700 people were living in five shelters. They sleep on floors and tables at schools, a mosque and a government building, receiving handouts of food three times a day. At one school, Latif, 32, a laborer, made a temporary home on a piece of cardboard with his wife and three children. Knee-high water floods their shack almost every rainy season, said his wife, Pardiem, 25. But this year they barely escaped through water that rose as high as their necks. Much of the flooding was concentrated in low-lying parts of the city populated mostly by the poor. But well-to-do residents were also affected, and the city's major hotels were overbooked with five-star refugees. The government meteorological agency said that light rains were forecast over the next few days but that the worst might have passed. The changeable weather of the last two days has multiplied the relief work of Captain Toar. ''We evacuate them and then the water goes down,'' he said, ''and they go home and then it rains again and we have to evacuate them again.'' A big gray army dinghy barely navigated a narrow street on Tuesday morning, where people leaned from second-floor balconies to smile and wave. In smaller lanes, Captain Toar said, soldiers must wade. He said his men had evacuated a 2-week-old baby by floating it along in a washtub in eight-foot-high water. Earlier on Tuesday, he said, it took 20 soldiers to carry a man who had died on the upper floor of a home through the deep water. Dragonflies hovered over the water and songbirds, evacuated in their cages to upstairs balconies, could be heard in the unaccustomed quiet of a street without traffic. Scavengers with huge cloth baskets pushed their way through yellowish chin-high water, plucking it clean with metal hooks. Some of their bounty finds its way to the Karet cemetery. The slum just downhill from the cemetery is home to an industry of scavengers, and they sat among the headstones sorting plastic bottles, washtubs, soggy cardboard and other produce of the flood. This is good news for Samsuri, 56, a middleman who buys the sorted material from the scavengers. ''It's like harvest time for garbage,'' he said."
"Mozambique's worst Zambezi River flooding since a catastrophic 2001 flood has forced more than 68,000 people from their homes and threatens scores of thousands more, relief officials said Tuesday, but the government said it did not yet need large-scale international aid. Forecasters predicted heavy rains in Mozambique for much of this week, however, and experts were watching the massive Cahora Bassa hydroelectric dam, the largest in southern Africa, for signs that it was being stretched to capacity. Engineers were releasing water from the 1,000-square-mile lake behind the dam at rates of 300,000 cubic feet a minute, at or above the levels that were released at the height of the 2001 flood. Those releases were coordinated with managers of a second large Zambezi dam upstream on the Zambia-Zimbabwe border, which also is nearing capacity. Mozambican officials said that at least 29 people had died in flood-related accidents, from drownings to electrocutions, but reports from rural areas, some cut off by flood waters, were spotty. Others placed the toll at 100 or more. Many acres of cropland have been inundated by the Zambezi, which was three and a half feet above flood stage in some places. The United Nations resident coordinator for Mozambique, Ndolamb Ngokwey, said in a telephone interview from Maputo, the capital, that almost 27,000 flood refugees had been placed in 53 camps and that nearly 42,000 more had fled rising waters and sought refuge elsewhere. The United Nations says that as many as 142,000 people may eventually need assistance; some Mozambican officials say the figure may be as low at 105,000. Mozambican officials declared a red alert, one level short of a national emergency. The United Nations is providing some food, water and sanitation supplies, but the government has declined for now more extensive offers of aid. ''We suppose that if the situation worsens, depending on the rains and on the dam, we probably will have more people seeking help,'' Mr. Ngokwey said. Paulo Zucula, who leads the National Disasters Management Institute, the government relief agency, was quoted by Reuters as saying that refugees were short of food, shelter and medical care, but that the situation remained under control. Amid reports that farmers were refusing to leave their livestock in threatened areas, Mozambique's prime minister, Luisa Diogo, ordered forced evacuations of citizens in low-lying areas of the Zambezi valley. The government says that 46,000 homes have been swept away by flood waters, but the figure was impossible to verify. Heavy rains in Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Angola and Mozambique have filled to overflowing some of the major streams that feed the Zambezi, one of Africa's mightiest rivers. The region has been plagued in recent years by drought, and blame for the latest torrents is being placed on on El Niño, the warming of Pacific Ocean regions that periodically causes significant changes in weather."
"WHEN Sue Linton was a single mother looking for a place with good schools and decent neighborhoods in the early 1980s, Wayne seemed the right bet. She had grown up in nearby Lincoln Park, and there were a few affordable houses available in an old riverfront area of Wayne called Hoffman Grove. ''Then came the 1984 flood. Oh, my God,'' Ms. Linton said. Not only did the Pompton River in front of her house flood, she said: ''It became a raging river. Swans were floating by, that kind of thing.'' Ms. Linton's house and those of many of her neighbors flooded, but she stayed, and it would not be the last time they flooded. The Hoffman Grove houses were built about 100 years ago as small vacation homes, but starting in the 1920s, people started living in them full time, putting up with the periodic flooding for a place by the river in a pleasant township like Wayne. Now, however, homeowners are willing to abandon their places, sending much of the Hoffman Grove area of the Pompton and Passaic Rivers back to nature. After some complicated litigation, about 40 of the 125 Hoffman Grove properties will be bought through the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. While the agency is interested in acquiring all the properties, which the town proposed for buying out because they are in a flood-prone area, FEMA has only enough money to help pay for about 40 of them. With a combination of money from FEMA, the State Department of Environmental Protection and a small amount from local taxes, Wayne has $5.9 million to spend to buy out property owners like Ms. Linton. FEMA would put up about two-thirds of the money. Specific properties have not been singled out, and homeowners cannot be forced to sell. Scott T. Rumana, the mayor of Wayne, said that after he took office in January 2002, he, like many of his predecessors, tried to figure out a solution to the chronic flooding. In recent years, for example, substantial flooding occurred in October 2005, April 2005 and December 2003. ''My godfather, Bob Roe, had tried to propose legislation about 20 years ago,'' Mr. Rumana said, referring to the former longtime United States representative. ''Flooding homes in a crowded state like New Jersey has been a problem for a long time.'' Mr. Rumana found out about the FEMA program and enlisted Bradley M. Campbell, then the commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, to let him form a Passaic River Basin task force, which basically identified the most flood-prone homes. Gary Seidenfeld, a New York/New Jersey project manager for FEMA, said that one reason towns with flood problems do not apply for the FEMA grants is that they pay only 50 to 75 percent of the value of the homes to be cleared, with towns having to find the rest. That, Mr. Seidenfeld said, is shortsighted. ''The towns forget that they will get cost savings in cleanup and other damage each time a flood occurs,'' he said. ''Plus they will get green space back again that is valuable in populated places like New Jersey.'' That is what happened in Collingswood in Camden County. A patch of mostly rental housing and one business near the traffic circle at the intersection of Routes 130 and 30 would flood seemingly every time it rained hard. Finally, said Kevin Hastings, Collingswood's director of revenue, the 2003 flooding caused by Hurricane Floyd motivated the borough's government to action. A FEMA grant led to a buyout of 30 properties in Collingswood, which are now all demolished. Mr. Hastings said most of the residents found other rental housing in Collingswood or nearby. About three-fourths of the money for the buyouts came from FEMA. ''We're making the land into a park, which may sound like we are losing tax revenue,'' Mr. Hastings said. ''But we will have more play areas for our kids and we won't have all the police and fire presence and the cleanup. In the end, it will save us money, too, I am sure.'' Hurricane Floyd was also the last straw for the residents of a chronically flooded section of Mulberry Street in Trenton. ''It was a sad situation,'' the Trenton mayor, Douglas H. Palmer, said. ''You don't want to disrupt a neighborhood, but people were just getting flooded it seemed like every year.'' Mr. Palmer said the flooding of Assunpink Creek had increased in recent years, possibly because there has been more development in northern, formerly rural, neighborhoods along its way to Trenton. The issue, though, was not to find out the cause, but to relieve the suffering of the residents, primarily renters, who were having to evacuate more frequently, Mr. Palmer said. Trenton won a FEMA grant, and now the three-block area is open space, designated unbuildable forever. One downside in the Wayne buyout is that while residents agree that the appraisals of the Hoffman Grove homes are fair -- in the $150,000 to $200,000 range -- the payout is not enough to allow them to buy homes elsewhere in town; the average home there, Mr. Rumana said, costs about twice that. Mr. Rumana has applied to the state Council on Affordable Housing in hopes of getting those being bought out in Hoffman Grove moved up on the council's priority list so they can stay in town. ''It seems like a natural: longtime residents who have contributed to the community getting priority for a state program,'' said Mr. Rumana, who said council officials had balked at the plan so far. Chris Donnelly, a spokesman for the council, said in an e-mail message it requires random selection because ''the Supreme Court has ruled that towns cannot give preference for affordable housing based on residency in the community.'' Mr. Rumana said ''everything else is so good'' about the plan. ''We'll have more natural land along the river for recreation, for instance,'' he said. ''We're hoping that it all works out and that stories about flooding homes in Wayne will be a thing of the past.'' FLOOD MANAGEMENT"
"Much of this capital city was underwater on Tuesday, and the authorities warned of the possible spread of disease after torrential rains, overflowing rivers and clogged sewers brought widespread flooding over the weekend. At least 29 people were reported to have died from drowning, electrocution or disease. An estimated 340,000 people were driven from their homes, and hundreds of thousands remained without electricity or clean water in the worst flooding in Jakarta in years. The skies cleared Monday, but meteorologists said more rain was possible in the days ahead, along with renewed flooding if rivers burst over their banks again. Across lower-lying parts of Jakarta that are populated mostly by the poor, water that had risen as high as 12 feet still engulfed entire houses. Officials estimated that 40 percent to 70 percent of this city of 12 million people had been submerged. From the air, it appeared in places that red tile roofs were floating on the brown water. Some people remained crowded in the upper floors of their homes without sanitation, utilities or telephone service. Some of them said they were remaining in their inundated houses to guard against looters. Others took shelter in schools and mosques, where they slept crammed together like refugees in their own city. Five-star hotels were overbooked with well-to-do residents who had fled the flooding. Telecommunications and Internet connections were disrupted at several foreign embassies. Evacuations were carried out with rafts and dinghies as well as on high-wheeled, horse-drawn carts and, in at least one deeply submerged area, by helicopter. Schools, markets and businesses closed as much of the city came to a standstill. Entire neighborhoods were accessible only by boat. For a time, the city's airport was accessible only by high-wheeled vehicles. In wealthier areas, some residents were paying for delivery of clean water. Didiet Haryadi, the director of Jakarta's water company, said it would take two to three weeks after the flooding recedes to restore the city's supply of clean water. There was panic buying of supplies in some supermarkets that remained open. Medical workers on rubber rafts patrolled the flooded areas treating people for diarrhea, skin diseases and respiratory problems. Officials warned of the possible spread of more serious ailments like dysentery, cholera, typhoid, malaria and dengue fever. ''We have to be alert for diseases like typhoid, those transmitted by rats and respiratory infections,'' said Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari. Officials also issued warnings about the bird flu virus, which has flared again in Indonesia this winter, causing the government to consider imposing a state of emergency. Sixty-three people have died of the virus in Indonesia, more than in any other country. Traffic in Jakarta is paralyzed by flooding every year during the rainy season, but this year's flood was among the worst in memory. Residents say the heaviest flooding comes in five-year cycles. In January 2002, flooding killed 21 people and forced 380,000 from their homes. Environmentalists said the annual floods had been growing worse and blamed clogged drains, trash-filled rivers and deforestation of hillsides south of the city for development. Critics also blame delays in extending a flood-control canal that carried excess water from overflowing rivers in this city where some neighborhoods lie below sea level. Responding to sharp criticism in the press for lack or preparation, Jakarta's governor, Sutiyoso, said that the flooding was part of a natural cycle and that there was nothing he could have done. ''There is no point in throwing abuse around,'' Mr. Sutiyoso told a local radio station. ''I was up till 3 a.m. trying to handle the refugees.''"
"More than 120 levees around the country could fail in a major flood and need to be better maintained, the Army Corps of Engineers said yesterday. The problems that led to what the corps called ''unacceptable maintenance ratings'' included erosion, tree growth on or too near levees, animal burrows and shifting soil. California has the largest number of problems, 37, and Washington State has 19. Louisiana has no levees on the list, said Maj. Gen. Don T. Riley, director of civil works for the corps, because those on the Mississippi River are well maintained and those around New Orleans are being rebuilt and strengthened after Hurricane Katrina. The list and more information are at www.hq.usace.army.mil/cepa/releases/leveesafety.htm. In most cases, the corps built the levees and handed them over to local communities to maintain them. The new assessment inevitably misses many local levees whose owners have not tried to meet federal standards and would not have been counted, General Riley said. There is more work to be done, he said, adding, ''It is a concern.'' General Riley said the corps would send the information to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which runs the National Flood Insurance Program. If the program determines that the levees are not adequate, flood insurance rates for people living near them could increase. The corps is looking at 2,000 levees."
"Too many shopping malls in the city. Too many squatters on the riverbanks. Too many villas on the southern hillsides. Or a curse hovering over the president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. Filthy water still fills much of the city a week after the start of the worst flood in decades, draining slowly away during dry spells, then topped up again by new rain storms. Officials say 80 people have now died, mostly by drowning and electrocution. And along with the misery of homelessness, power failures and traffic jams, the city is troubled by a babble of theories, recriminations and superstitious whispers about why Indonesia is plagued by natural disasters. Over the past two years, Indonesia has suffered an encyclopedia of troubles, from the devastating tsunami of December 2004 to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, droughts, bird flu outbreaks, landslides, airline crashes and a vast, bizarre geyser of mud -- a constant pounding of catastrophes that has worn down the national psyche and convinced many that something supernatural is going on. ''Since the day he took office there have been unending disasters,'' said Permadi, a member of Parliament and a mystic, of the president. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name. Mr. Yudhoyono was born under a bad sign, he said, and nature is demonstrating its anger at him and the nation. But the flood that at one point inundated up to 70 percent of the city is traceable to more tangible problems, many here say. It exposes the limitations and dangers of Indonesia's aging infrastructure. And it demonstrates the growing pains of a democratic transformation that could produce more responsive governments. To begin with, this port city of 43 lakes and 13 rivers that lies partly below sea level still relies on flood canals and sluice gates that were built by the Dutch 160 years ago. The clearing of trees on nearby hillsides has removed a natural check on flooding, while the housing developments that have replaced them have put a further strain on public works. This uneven development is an example of the central problem of Indonesian infrastructure, said Ramesh Subramaniam, principal economist at the Asian Development Bank in Indonesia. ''It is essentially a conflict between private consumption, which is going up, and public investment in infrastructure, which is almost stagnant,'' he said. As the economy grows about 6 percent a year, with a proliferation of homes, offices and shopping centers, almost no new roads, bridges, airports, power lines or water systems have been built since the Asian economic crisis a decade ago. More malls, more squatter communities, more hillside villas: all contribute to breakdowns in urban services and to disasters like the flood. ''There is no question that the economy is growing now at a healthy clip,'' said Douglas E. Ramage, the country representative of the Asia Foundation. ''But the growth is going to bump smack up against infrastructure limitations.'' Because of complex regulations and legal uncertainties, there has been very little foreign investment in infrastructure in recent years. Two conferences in the past two years that offered nearly 100 projects to foreign investors produced no contracts. ''China has built more roads in the last year than Indonesia in the last 20 years,'' said Jim Castle, chief executive of CastleAsia, a consultancy and research firm. ''I think they have installed more telephones in six months than Indonesia has installed in 10 years.'' Attempts to overcome this problem, and to become more responsive to disasters like the flood, have been complicated as Indonesia reconfigures its democratic system. It is dispersing power from the center to local governments and instituting direct elections of government officials. With weaker central control, different levels of government and different jurisdictions can now find themselves at odds. Trees are cut down and housing developments are built without coordination on Jakarta's outskirts. And when a disaster strikes, the response is often uncoordinated and, as a result, chaotic. Eventually, though, political analysts say local accountability and direct elections will push officials to be more responsive to the needs of their constituents. This, too, is expected to be part of the story of the Jakarta flood. This summer, for the first time in its 450-year history, Jakarta will directly elect a governor, and the flood is expected to be a major issue. ''This is as much a governance issue as a natural disaster,'' Mr. Ramage said. ''All over Indonesia, as cities get to elect their mayors and provinces directly elect their heads, we are beginning to see more responsible government.'' Responding to the emergency much as they have in the past, incumbent officials were busy this week pointing fingers at one another. The city's governor, Sutiyoso, blamed deforestation and overbuilding in neighboring areas and a lack of financing from above. Environment Minister Racmat Witoelar blamed officials for issuing improper building permits. The Public Works Ministry blamed people whose land blocks the route of a new flood canal. The coordinating minister for the people's welfare, Aburizal Bakrie, took himself off the hook, saying news coverage of the flood had been exaggerated. ''We see that victims are still laughing,'' he told a television reporter. Mr. Sutiyoso has served for a decade as governor without having to worry about votes and has paid little political price for his inaction after a similar major flood in 2002. It is even possible to imagine that Mr. Permadi, the mystical member of Parliament, is engaging a little more with what is sometimes called the reality-based world. ''From a spiritual perspective,'' he said, ''there are two ways of looking at the flood.'' One is the bad karma of both national and local leaders. ''The other is that it is now rainy season.''"
"The big loud trucks rumble upstream, past where the Sunshine Point campground stood before the flood, beyond the historic park buildings that came so close to being swept away when the Nisqually River blew out its banks in November. Then, at a bend where there used to be a wall of evergreens and now there is an unbroken view of the Nisqually, the trucks unload their cargo. Boulders that weigh 15,000 pounds or more tumble out and over the precipice that was once the shoulder of the road and is now the new riverbank. The goal is to replace the earth beneath the road that the river washed away after a record 18 inches of rain fell in two days. But for all the push to reopen parts of Mount Rainer National Park in time for spring, there is also a sense that the repairs, whether here on a main road or on a log bridge deep in the backcountry, is about more than recovering from one brutal historic storm. It is about guarding against the mystery of what might come next. ''Seven or eight tons,'' Jim Gilmore, an owner of the Columbia Granite Quarry, said of the stones that his company has hauled to the park this week from 60 miles away in Vail, Wash. ''With the velocity of the waters and the climate change, that's the only thing that holds up anymore.'' There has always been flooding here driven by big rains and glacial runoff, and diagnosing the causes of natural disasters is particularly complicated when questions about climate change add tension to so many debates. But officials here say the damage to popular routes through the park is unprecedented. Parts of roads are washed out. The 93-mile Wonderland Trail in the backcountry lost at least 10 footbridges to flooding, though the winter snow probably hides much more damage. Kautz Creek in the southwestern corner of the park changed course, flowing a few hundred feet to the east of where it had been. ''Do we just move the sign up the road?'' Lee Taylor, who runs two visitors' centers, asked as she watched the creek churn out of the woods and into a culvert installed in a hasty effort to keep the water from rushing over a road. ''We don't really know where this creek is going to stay yet.'' Kautz Creek has altered its course before, including decades ago, when sediment from glaciers rushed downstream. But other nearby streams, close to the Van Trump and Pyramid Glaciers, have no record of releasing debris until the last few years, said Paul M. Kennard, the geomorphologist at the park. Near the historic park headquarters at Longmire, sediment released from retreating glaciers has in recent years been piling up on the Nisqually bed at about a foot a year. After the November flood, heavy machinery was brought in to build new riverbanks to protect the old log buildings. ''All the glaciers are by far at their historic minimum,'' Mr. Kennard said. ''The rivers are going to have less capacity to hold floods, and the storms seem to be getting stronger. ''Long term, the prognosis isn't that good. What I'm most interested in is trying to figure out what the rivers are going to throw at us in the near future, particularly these debris flows. I think it's something that's really kind of snuck up on us.'' The 14,410-foot summit of Mount Rainier and its shoulders loom across the Puget Sound region, where it is known simply as the Mountain. The park, established in 1899, is the nation's fifth oldest. The summit is the fifth highest in the lower 48 states. The mountain makes its own weather, bottling Pacific moisture into an annual average of 680 inches of snowfall at Paradise, the most popular visitors' center. The mountain is also an active volcano, where geologists plan to expand seismic monitoring. Nearly two million people a year visit. The repairs focus on access and safety, park officials say, not on scrubbing away all evidence of the storm. The cost for all the repairs is $36 million, so far. Some national parks have been feeling the effects of climate change for years, including Glacier National Park in Montana and parks in Alaska. A comprehensive plan for climate change in the parks that would include how to respond when public areas are damaged is in the formative stage, said Julie Thomas McNamee, a spokeswoman for the parks agency in Washington, D.C. Parks in the West have been leading efforts to deal with climate change. To do so, officials say, they have to balance access and preservation. At Mount Rainier, that means protecting spotted owls, marbled murrelets and bull trout. The superintendent, Dave Uberuaga, recalled meeting recently with engineers at Longmire to discuss dealing with buildup of sediment. ''The engineering folks came in and said, 'Oh, well, you just dredge that out,' '' Mr. Uberuaga said. ''Well, we don't do that. This is a national park.'' Still, he said, the park will probably have to alter small parts of its landscape where people near the front lines of a changing climate. ''The natural process is going to continue to happen,'' Mr. Uberuaga said. ''But at a few pinch points, we're going to have be more deliberate about how we prepare for that.'' MOUNT RAINIER NATIONAL PARK JOURNAL"
"WHEN the 40-foot-high Kaloko dam collapsed on the Hawaiian island of Kauai last March, its reservoir released a 70-foot-high, 200-foot-wide, 1.6-million-ton wave that carried away 16 cars, hundreds of trees and a cluster of houses, drowning all seven occupants. At least two bodies were swept three-quarters of a mile to the ocean; four were never recovered. It is tempting to dismiss Kaloko's collapse as an isolated event, but given the perilous state of the nation's dams, it is more likely a harbinger. In 2005, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave United States dams a D, a grade that is still justified two years later. For starters, the nation's dam stock is rapidly aging. Most dams need major repairs 25 to 50 years after they're built, and most United States dams are at least 25 years old; some, like the 116-year-old Kaloko, were built more than a century ago. As dams age, their danger increases. This is a matter of not just advancing decrepitude, but ''hazard creep'' -- the tendency of developers to build directly downstream from dams, in the path of floods that would follow dam failures. The result is that even though Americans now build few dams, more and more dams threaten people's lives. Chiefly for this reason, the number of dams identified in one estimate as capable of causing death and in need of rehabilitation more than doubled from 1999 to 2006, from around 500 to nearly 1,400. The civil engineers' 2005 report placed the number of unsafe dams much higher, at more than 3,500. On top of that, dam safety officials are so overworked that in most states, they don't come close to carrying out all the inspections required by law. According to the engineers' society, the average state dam inspector is responsible for 268 dams; in four states the number exceeds 1,200. It is no coincidence that even though Hawaiian law requires dam inspections every five years, Kaloko was never inspected. We don't even know how many dams the country possesses. Using one set of criteria, the National Inventory of Dams, maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers, places the number at 79,777, while the sum of dams inventoried by the states is more than 99,000. Even that number is questionable, since it includes suspiciously low counts from several states. In addition, state officials are constantly discovering previously uncounted dams during routine inspection trips. And if the definition of dams is broadened to include the smallest ones, the estimates are as high as several million. Unlike, say, waterways and sanitation plants, a majority of dams -- 56 percent of those inventoried -- are privately owned, which is one reason dams are among the country's most dangerous structures. Many private owners can't afford to repair aging dams; some owners go so far as to resist paying by tying up official repair demands in court or campaigning to weaken state dam safety laws. When the Kauai public works department ordered Kaloko's owner to stop grading a hilltop next to the reservoir in 1997, the local mayor interceded, instructing the responsible county engineer not to interfere; an investigation by a Hawaiian deputy attorney general published on Jan. 8 found that the owner then covered the earthen dam's emergency spillway with dirt, in the process weakening the dam's defenses. Thousands of dams have been abandoned by their owners, and over time, title to them has become obscure -- 12 percent of the dams in the Army Corps of Engineers' inventory have no known owner. As these dams become dilapidated, the states are left with the expensive task of repairing or dismantling them. Privatization advocates, take heed: this is a cautionary tale. Climate change will also make dams more dangerous by increasing precipitation in many parts of the country, thus undermining the flood assumptions that underlie dam designs. Consider that in October 2005 and last May, two strong but hardly cataclysmic New England rain storms caused the overtopping or breaching of more than 400 dams in three states; a much fiercer storm would compromise far more dams, worsening flooding and potentially endangering thousands of people. Dams are ranked according to the danger they pose -- ''high hazard'' dams threaten human life if they fail; ''significant hazard'' dams threaten property; and ''low hazard'' dams threaten neither. But many dams are inaccurately ranked -- the Kaloko dam, for instance, was rated low hazard. In addition, in most states the rankings do not take into account the potential impact of toxic chemicals from factories, agricultural runoff and mines that gather in sediment behind dams, even though their sudden release can poison humans, wildlife and vegetation far downstream. When a coal tailings dam near Inez, Ky., failed in October 2000, 250 million gallons of coal sludge were sent into the Big Sandy River and its tributaries, killing aquatic life in the streams. More sobering still, about half the dams in the Corps' inventory, including many high-hazard ones, do not have emergency plans in case of failure. When these plans are properly executed -- by identifying structures likely to be inundated and keeping up-to-date records of residents' phone numbers -- they save lives. But the plans that do exist are often inaccurate, and many of the people they're intended to protect have no idea of the potential peril they face. California is the only state that even requires property buyers to be informed of potential jeopardy from an upstream dam. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimated in 2005 that repairing dams threatening human life would cost $10.1 billion, while a 2003 study by the Association of Dam Safety Officials placed the cost of repairing all non-federally owned dams in the national inventory at $36.2 billion. In the last session Congress considered legislation to repair dams at a rate of $25 million a year for five years, but even that feeble gesture didn't make it out of committee. Americans are easily persuaded to spend hundred of billions of dollars combating debatable terrorist threats from outside the United States, while failing to notice that inside the country, the infrastructure is crumbling. True, outside forces from time to time topple established regimes, but usually not before their insides have started to rot.

"IN one 24-hour period last week in New Orleans, now a small city of 200,000, six people were murdered. Last year's total of 161 murders probably made New Orleans the deadliest city in the United States by a significant margin. I suppose it was only a matter of time before the violence touched my life directly. Last Thursday morning I received a call from my friend Kittee. ''I have awful news,'' she said, and then, very quickly: ''Someone broke into Paul and Helen's house. Helen was shot and killed. Paul was holding Baby Francis and was shot three times. He's still alive. Francis is O.K.'' Paul Gailiunas -- Dr. Paul, I call him -- had been my physician for several years at the Little Doctors Clinic, a health center for poor people that he founded in Treme, one of America's oldest black neighborhoods. I had started to see Paul after my previous doctor mocked one of my colleagues about our work representing people on Louisiana's death row. When I met Paul through a friend, I asked him directly, ''Are you in favor of the death penalty?'' He responded, with a smile, ''Eh, I'm Canadian,'' clearly feeling that was answer enough. And it was, coming from the founder of our local chapter of Food Not Bombs and the front man for the Troublemakers (a band whose songs celebrate Emma Goldman and the idea of universal health care) in such a lighthearted tone that it would scarcely have alienated the most ardent conservative. Helen Hill was Paul's perfect match -- a kind and generous woman who made award-winning animated films and taught art and filmmaking to children, adults, anyone who was interested. She'd spent much of the last year restoring reels of 16-millimeter film on which she had drawn by hand, and which had been damaged when their house took four feet of water during Hurricane Katrina. She had a new film under way, inspired by discarded hand-sewn dresses, made by an elderly New Orleanian, which Helen had found in the trash after the woman's death. The film interwove the story of the old woman and her dresses with Helen's own flood-torn life, which took her, Paul and Francis to Columbia, S.C. -- Helen's hometown, where she will be buried today -- for almost a year. Helen had longed to return to New Orleans, despite Paul's concern that crime and potential hurricanes made it too dangerous for their family. So Helen campaigned, sending Paul's friends in New Orleans blank postcards, addressed to Paul, for us to write and mail to him. In mine, I pleaded with Paul -- ''We need you'' -- the way I do with anyone who is thinking about leaving, coming to, or even just visiting New Orleans. After what I am sure was a flood of similar cards, Paul relented. I saw Paul and the baby a day after their return to the city, at a parade on the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Francis had on a little railroad conductor's hat, a T-shirt depicting a cartoon love affair between red beans and rice (the New Orleans Monday lunch classic), and a little sign pinned to his back, in Helen's hand: ''New Orleans Native. I Got Back Yesterday!'' The day of the anniversary was solemn but optimistic. Everyone still had a can-do attitude. Paul, for one, could help make the city's people well and improve health care for the poor. Helen could make art depicting the city's life. Others could rebuild schools, demand better levees, reconstruct their homes. It still felt as if our grassroots efforts, along with some real help from a government finally forced to make good on its obligations, could create a more just, fair and safe city. It might have been naïve, but it really seemed possible. After wandering this beautiful, falling-over city the afternoon after Helen's murder, forcing myself to remember why I love it here so much, I came back to my garden and picked flowers, those hardy few that had weathered the recent cold. I put them in a vase, wrote out the verses to Edna St. Vincent Millay's ''Dirge Without Music'' -- ''I am not resigned to the shutting away of loving hearts in the hard ground / So it is, and so it will be, for so it has been, time out of mind'' -- and drove to the couple's house, which my wife and I had recently visited for Helen's open studio. On the steps leading up to their old shotgun house I set down the poem and the vase, just feet from where Paul had been found by the police, shot, bleeding, holding his baby. On the way home, I stopped at my neighborhood bar to try to eat something. A picture of Paul and Helen, followed by one of the baby, appeared on the television in the corner. Oh, my God. The bartender was kind. She asked me whether I knew them, and talked to me about her fears living with her new baby in a city with no functional schools, no real plan for redevelopment, and spotty or nonexistent basic services. The TV news switched to a weather report: torrential downpours were expected to dump half a foot of rain overnight. I drove home in the twilight and arrived uneasy and restless. Remembering the coming rain, I resolved to make myself useful to my block by digging out a sewer so backed up that the street -- on high ground by New Orleans standards -- floods at even the hint of rain. I had done this many times before, having realized that my innumerable calls to the city were in vain. I pried up the 100-pound cast iron cover with a shovel and then shimmied it from side to side until I had the two-by-four sewer open. It was full to the top with debris. I shoveled out the leaves, dirt, Popeye's cups and other garbage until the small brick rectangle was as clean as it was a century ago, when New Orleans first created this drainage system. Then I set to work on clearing the cylindrical drain -- about as wide as a hubcap, at the bottom corner of the cleaned-out basin -- so that the rain could find its way into the city's sewers, away from our houses, cars and belongings. I got down with a small shovel and burrowed through the muck until it seemed to open at the other side. Reaching in, though, I could feel that beyond the drain lay more dirt and leaves, packed hard. Indeed, it became clear to me that the whole sewer line running beneath the street was solid with waste, impenetrable to arms and shovels -- that my street would flood again that night. The problem, I realized, is bigger than me. I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.

"WESTERN Europe often experiences extremes of weather in a uniform way, as when a catastrophic summer heat wave in 2003 in a half-dozen countries caused the deaths of thousands of people. In the United States, which spans a continent, there is almost never a shared sense of meteorological misery -- as was made vividly clear when epic snows buried Denver as if two winters hit back to back while the Northeast basked in warmth that seemed to render the whole idea of seasons meaningless. Some climate experts muse that the innately variegated climate across the country might help explain why it has taken longer for human-caused global warming to rise to the level of a national priority here than in Europe. This is not a testable hypothesis, and the experts note that many other factors contribute to varied attitudes on the issue, ranging from contrasting cultural and political biases to different levels of dependence on oil and coal or the industries that profit from them. But they do see the climate issue compounded here by how normal it is to have abnormal -- and very different -- conditions around the country. ''What happened in Europe was everybody experienced the same things,'' said Michael MacCracken, who spent 32 years studying climate change for the Energy Department and now works at the Climate Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington. ''Often mainland Europe gets a common flooding event,'' he said. ''Their rivers connect everything so they feel it all the way down the Rhine or the Danube.'' In the lower 48 states, he said, conditions are shaped by variable patterns of warming and cooling in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the atmospheric blockade created by the Rockies and other factors. This essentially guarantees that the country is almost always experiencing more than one so-called weather anomaly at a time, Dr. MacCracken said. ''People live the weather,'' he said. ''Climate is a mental construct.'' Michael Mann, a climatologist at Pennsylvania State University, said the varied influences on the North American climate not only inhibited a common appreciation for current climate extremes but also made it harder to project how conditions in a particular region would change should heat-trapping smokestack and tailpipe gases continue to build in the atmosphere. He has another theory about why Washington, particularly, has lagged even as some states and cities have moved ahead to limit such emissions. ''The East Coast of the United States, and particularly the mid-Atlantic region, did not warm nearly as much as rest of globe over the 20th century,'' Dr. Mann said. ''And that's where the decision-making is going on.'' IDEAS & TRENDS"
"CALLING the flooding from last Sunday's storm among the worst in the state's history, Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey said the northeaster that deluged the region with more than nine inches of rain caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage and killed at least three people. Mr. Codey declared a state of emergency on Monday as many of the state's major rivers began to flood their banks, in some cases causing devastating damage, particularly in Passaic and Bergen Counties and parts of Somerset County. ''New Jersey clearly has received the brunt of this storm. We were in the middle of the bull's-eye,'' Mr. Codey said after an aerial tour of flooded areas on Wednesday afternoon. ''It wasn't localized. It was all over the state. Whether you were up north or south or central, you got hit, and you got hit hard, and it just wouldn't let up.'' Mr. Codey has sent a letter to President Bush requesting federal aid, and representatives of the Federal Emergency Management Agency started to tour the state on Thursday afternoon to assess the damage, a process that was expected to take several days. At least three people died as a result of the storm. Niranjankumar Soni, 52, of Edison, was trapped in his car in a flooded underpass in Woodbridge. The police found Nicholas Pennucci, 79, of Bloomfield, drowned near his flooded-out car on Main Street in Belleville. And on Wednesday, the Mahwah police retrieved the body of Mary Pat Wagner, 44; she had been missing since Sunday and was believed to have accidentally driven into the Ramapo River. The New Jersey State Police said that 3,300 people had been evacuated from their homes, mainly in Passaic and Somerset Counties; most had not been permitted to return as of Thursday afternoon, with the exception of those living in Manville, in Somerset County. The state police also set up a special hot line -- 211 -- to provide safety tips and information for flood victims about insurance and financial assistance. In Manville, which is surrounded by the Raritan and Millstone Rivers, both rivers crested above the flood stage, submerging the downtown under nearly 10 feet of water. More than 600 houses were affected, making the town accessible only by boat for three days, said Mayor Angelo Corradino. By Thursday the water had receded and the cleanup had begun. Mr. Corradino said the town had suffered about $13 million in damage. The Passaic River began to rise above flood stage on Monday night, state officials said, and by Tuesday had flooded significant portions of Little Falls, Paterson and West Paterson, affecting hundreds of homes. The storm caused major delays on New Jersey Transit bus and train lines and at the local airports, including Teterboro, which was closed for two days after its runways flooded. Willowbrook Mall in Wayne was closed because of flooding, and remained closed as of Thursday. The Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus and the Paramus Park shopping center were closed on Monday. Kris Kolluri, the state transportation commissioner, said that at the height of the storm more than 70 roads were closed but that only one, Route 56 in Pittsgrove, was seriously damaged, with 300 feet of the highway completely washed out. He estimated damage to the state's roads at about $15 million and said that crews have been examining more than 200 bridges statewide for problems, a process that is to continue for the next three weeks."
"The storm destined for the books as the northeaster of '07 continued its assault on the New York region and the Northeast yesterday, forcing the evacuation of thousands from flooded homes, disrupting travel, closing schools and trailing a wake of rising rivers, gouged beaches, power failures and widespread damage. The awesome storm, which swamped New York City and other locales on Sunday with record rains, punishing winds and heavy snows that recast northern landscapes, stalled over the Northeast yesterday. But forecasters said it had lost its punch and would churn to oblivion over the Atlantic today. At least nine deaths in five states were attributed to the storm. There were no immediate estimates of its damage, which seemed likely to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. And it was not over. While coastal flooding was receding in most areas, rivers were still rising, swollen by the runoff of record rains. Public officials warned of continuing and widespread power problems and commuting headaches. ''The storm may be over, but it will take time to recover,'' the Westchester County executive, Andrew J. Spano, said last night. He urged drivers to use mass transit, asked residents and business owners to document damage with photographs and receipts to support claims for federal assistance, and warned of unscrupulous contractors, fraudulent charities, fake inspectors and other scam artists. As the rain continued falling, 223 more flights were canceled at the area's three major airports, on top of Sunday's 600. Scores of roads were closed, many commuter trains ran late or not at all, evacuees spent the night in shelters, and thousands of low-lying homes along rivers in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut were flooded or in danger of flooding today or tomorrow. The acting governor of New Jersey declared a state of emergency. The Boston Marathon was run in a drizzle. But power was still out at 328,000 homes and businesses in nine states from Maryland to Maine. New York officials told of major erosion at Jones Beach, Robert Moses State Park and beaches in Montauk on Long Island. Westchester County schools were closed for the day. Airlines and commuter lines struggled to resume their schedules, but are expected to do better today. And meteorologists profiled an astounding storm: 7.57 inches of rain in Central Park on Sunday made it the city's second-wettest day since recordkeeping began in 1869; other rain records were set in Philadelphia, Newark, Trenton, Baltimore, Washington and Bridgeport, Conn.; 26 inches of snow hit Tupper Lake, N.Y., and winds were clocked at 72 miles an hour in Milton, Mass., 81 m.p.h. in Cape Elizabeth, Me., and 156 m.p.h. at Mount Washington in New Hampshire. For millions, it was a tough day of coping -- of watching floodwater pour into homes on the Raritan River in New Jersey from New Brunswick to Bound Brook and in the Westchester suburbs of Mamaroneck and New Rochelle, of sleeping in a shelter or an airport, of towing a car and watching a refrigerator float by, of getting to work despite flooded roads and erratic trains, of waiting for power or a water pump or just something to hope for. ''We lost everything,'' Gloria Martinez, 75, one of 300 Mamaroneck, N.Y., residents who were driven from their homes and spent the night in a shelter at a high school, sobbed in Spanish to Gov. Eliot Spitzer as she sat amid a few plastic bags that held her possessions. It had been only hours since the water had risen to her shoulders and forced her from her apartment. The governor took her hand, but there was little he could say to her. Later, speaking to reporters on a tour of the damaged area, Mr. Spitzer said Mamaroneck had been one of the hardest-hit places in the state. National Guard troops had been called in overnight to assist in the evacuations of 60 to 70 flooded homes. ''Just the magnitude of the devastation is always shocking and hard to absorb,'' the governor said. ''When you see the folks, you see the devastation in their eyes.'' Roads along rivers in Westchester County were severely disrupted by flooding. Portions of the Saw Mill, Bronx River and Hutchinson River Parkways were closed, and traffic slowed to a crawl on roads that were open. In Croton-on-Hudson, the Croton River spilled over its banks, and half of the parking lot at the commuter train station was under water. In New Jersey, acting Gov. Richard J. Codey said in Trenton that 1,400 residents were evacuated from homes along the Raritan River, mainly in Bound Brook and Manville. David A. Robinson, the state climatologist, said the river crested at 38.5 feet at midafternoon, 10.5 feet above flood stage. While most of New Jersey's rivers -- the Ramapo, the Passaic, the Delaware and others -- had not overflowed, the Raritan was expected to continue rising today and tomorrow, said Capt. Jerome Hatfield of the state police emergency management office. Mr. Codey said that sections of 54 roads in New Jersey had been closed because of flooding, but that the interstate highways were all open. He called the storm the second-worst in state history, after Tropical Storm Floyd in 1999, and said it had dropped more rain than any storm since 1882. Hoboken became an island as roads surrounding the city flooded, in some cases up to three feet, submerging cars, basements and parking lots.Classes were canceled in dozens of school districts in New Jersey, as well as at Bergen Community College, and the New Brunswick and Piscataway campuses of Rutgers University. In Connecticut, where up to eight inches of rain fell, rivers overflowed in sections of Westport, Fairfield and Trumbull. In Bridgeport, the Pequonnock River sent water gushing into basements, parks and roadways. Besides 43,000 customers without power in Connecticut, utilities reported power failures all over the Northeast: 10,000 households and businesses in the New York area, 55,000 in upstate New York, 40,000 in New Jersey, 30,000 in Maryland, 50,000 in Pennsylvania, 46,000 in New Hampshire, 17,000 in Maine, 25,000 in Vermont and 12,000 in Massachusetts. For many, there were no firm predictions on when power would be restored. On Long Island, roads and schools were open. Flooding occurred along canals in Seaford and Freeport, and several homes were heavily damaged in the Davis Park community on Fire Island. Travel was a frustration for thousands. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reported two-hour flight delays at La Guardia Airport and three hours at Newark Liberty International Airport, but none during the day at Kennedy Airport. Amtrak said downed trees and flooding had delayed service between Washington and Boston, and some long-distance trains were canceled. Across the New York region, commuters ran into problems. Metro-North reported delays of up to 60 minutes on its Harlem Line, with shorter and scattered delays on its New Haven and Hudson Lines. The Long Island Rail Road reported 30- to 45-minute delays across the board, affecting 90 percent of its city-bound riders. In the evening, 17 trains were canceled. New Jersey Transit reported delays of up to 30 minutes on trains in and out of Pennsylvania Station, and up to 60 minutes on bus lines. In one of the few bright reports of a gloomy day, ferries on 17 New York Waterway routes operated normally. ''Flooding may disrupt roads and tracks,'' said Patrick Smith, a spokesman, ''but a little water never stopped a boat.'' Editors' Note: April 19, 2007, Thursday A picture on the front page of The Metro Section on Tuesday with an article about flooding caused by the recent northeaster showed an antiques shop in Ridgefield, Conn., being washed away. The wood siding at the far left of the pink building was out of alignment because the picture was retouched by a Times staff member who took the picture, but who is not a staff photographer. He altered it because a flash created a white spot on the picture when he shot it through the window of a train. Also, the retouching tool left a round circle on the building's window at right. Times policy forbids the manipulation of any photograph. Had editors been aware of the manipulation and seen the original picture, they would have either published the picture with the blemish or not used it."
"While much of the region on Wednesday was cleaning up from the weekend's record-breaking storm, thousands of residents in towns along the Passaic River were forced from their homes by surging floodwaters. From Paterson, where 1,500 residents fled, to Little Falls, where more than 400 homes were damaged, the end of the rainfall brought no respite. The 80-mile river, which is considered one of the most flood-prone systems in the country, drains about 835 square miles of northern New Jersey and southern New York, according to the Passaic River Coalition, a preservation group. Because the Passaic drains so much water from such a large area, it takes longer for the river to crest downstream. By Wednesday morning, six of seven bridges spanning the Passaic River were closed, because either the bridges or the roads leading to them were impassable. In addition, several roads remained closed in Lodi, New Milford and Oradell. ''Traffic was at bumper-to-bumper levels from 7 in the morning until noon,'' said José Torres, the mayor of Paterson. While residents fought the swollen river, Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey toured the saturated state by helicopter. About 5,000 people in 11 counties were forced to leave their homes in recent days, and at least three people were killed. Search teams retrieved the body of a woman yesterday who was believed to have accidentally driven into the Ramapo River on Sunday night, the police said. The woman, Mary Wagner, of Mahwah, had been reported missing since the night of the storm. Mr. Codey said the damage statewide would easily reach ''tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars.'' ''New Jersey clearly has received the brunt of this storm,'' he said. ''We were in the middle of the bull's-eye. It wasn't localized. It was all over the state. Whether you were up north or south or central, you got hit, and you got hit hard, and it just wouldn't let up.'' In Bergen County alone, preliminary reports indicated that there was at least $300 million in damage, said Brian Hague, a spokesman for the county executive, Dennis McNerney. In his assessment, Mr. Codey was not telling merchants anything they did not already know. Many were pumping out basements and complaining about lost business and mounting expenses. Mr. Torres visited an emergency shelter at Passaic County Community College, where about 100 people had sought refuge overnight. A large gym was lined with cots, and donated clothing was distributed. Mr. Torres said that Mr. Codey and state police officials were sending additional rescuers to help those who had to flee their homes. The Passaic River crested at 11.88 feet near Paterson and Little Falls around midnight, said David A. Robinson, the state climatologist, and by 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday it had not dropped significantly. Dr. Robinson said the river was not expected to drop below flood stage until Saturday afternoon, making this the third-worst flood on record in Little Falls. The worst occurred in 1903, when the water reached 17.5 feet. Kirk R. Barrett, the director of the Passaic River Institute at Montclair State University, said a recent study of 18 flood gauges along the river showed an increase in 100-year storms at 8 gauges, and no decreases in the frequency of flooding. He said that overdevelopment, the loss of wetlands and climate change could well account for the phenomenon. At the community college shelter in Paterson, Jalissa Covington, 19, said she decided to flee her home on Governor Street around 6 p.m. on Tuesday, when the water was four feet deep. ''All our stuff is damaged,'' she said, as she looked through donated clothes with her cousin, Sabrina Covington, 17. They had left home with just a few changes of clothes. In Little Falls, Joe Assaly said he had planned to stay home and ride out the storm. But early Wednesday, as water began rising in his driveway, he decided it was time to go. About 1 a.m., Mr. Assaly said, he waded through the knee-deep water that had accumulated on Parkway Avenue and spent the night in his car on a higher plot of land. ''It takes a lot to scare me,'' Mr. Assaly said. ''But that rising water sure did.'' By Wednesday afternoon, with more than four feet of water in his house and thousands of dollars in damage, he had made up his mind to move. ''I love my house,'' Mr. Assaly said, ''but I don't ever want to deal with this again. Time to go someplace higher.'' The situation was much the same in nearby West Paterson, where Michael Ibrahim stood in a parking lot looking at his submerged restaurant, the King of Shish Kabob on McBride Avenue. ''Everything is gone, ruined,'' Mr. Ibrahim said. ''But, I am safe, my wife and daughter are safe, and we can replace what is lost. Money is money. It comes and goes.'' He said he hoped to reopen, although he needed to assess the damage. ''With the power off, the food has certainly gone bad,'' he said. In Paterson, Morningstar Santana, who moved to New Jersey five months ago, stepped outside the community college shelter for a cigarette in the mid-afternoon, dressed in a robe and slippers. She had fled her rented home on Watson Street on Tuesday with few of her possessions. She said the Dunkin' Donuts where she works was also flooded. ''It's not good,'' she said."
"A rare spring northeaster masquerading as a classic winter storm roared up the coast and across the New York region and the Northeast yesterday with bullying winds and torrential rains that flooded shorelines and rivers, disrupted travel, brought down power lines and washed out Sunday plans for millions of people. The storm -- a globular nebula 800 miles across that reached from the Carolinas to New England -- inundated many low-lying roads, set rainfall records, canceled flights, closed businesses and ballparks and prompted evacuations, National Guard patrols and warnings to ships at sea. By midnight, 7.46 inches had fallen in Central Park, making yesterday the second wettest day there since recordkeeping began in 1869. Invading the New York area before dawn with pounding wind and rain, the storm sent tides surging against coastal beaches and riverfront communities, forced the cancellation of more than 500 flights at the three major airports, closed 20 roads in New Jersey and others in New York, cut off power to 18,500 customers in three states and tore off a roof at an apartment complex on Long Island. By late afternoon, rainfall records were toppling all over the region. The Central Park total was second only to the 8.28 inches that fell there on Sept. 23, 1882. The previous record for the date -- 1.82 inches -- was erased early in the day. At La Guardia Airport, 6.5 inches fell, surpassing the 1.64 inches of 1990, and at Kennedy International Airport, 2.2 inches was recorded, topping the previous record of 1.84. Other records that fell by 5 p.m. were in Philadelphia, with 3.36 inches (1 inch in 1906); Trenton, with 3.08 (1.3 in 1906); and Reagan National Airport in Washington, with 2.53 (1.94 in 1983). Wind gusts of up to 48 miles an hour were clocked at Kennedy. The highest wind hit 71 miles an hour at Charleston, S.C., the National Weather Service said. Before tapering off today, the storm was expected to have dropped more than 4 inches of rain across the region, as well as a foot or more of snow in parts of upstate New York and northern New England. Coming on a weekend, the storm had a relatively light impact on most residents. Many shops and restaurants that normally would have been open yesterday were shuttered, but without jobs or schools to attend, many people spent the day indoors with the Sunday papers, relaxing with music to go with the silken lash of rain hissing at the windows, dripping on a lazy afternoon. The day was, in a way, like great theater: the drama of the approaching storm, the searching wind at the panes and rain dancing on the pavement, the smudged sky, the iron-gray day like a movie in black and white. The overcast was solid, great plates of corrugated iron fused from horizon to horizon, and the streets glistened in the rain: a metallic futureworld. Today was expected to be normal for most commuters, though the Long Island Rail Road said last night that it was expecting some delays and diversions. Forecasters said showers would linger, but the storm's worst had gone and temperatures were expected to hover in the 40s. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg urged commuters to take mass transit today. It was a different story yesterday. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reported flight delays of up to seven hours at Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Liberty International Airports, and said that airlines had canceled more than 500 flights, including some scheduled for today. Railroads ran with delays but, aside from a brief shutdown on two Metro-North lines, no major disruptions. But many roads and streets ran like millraces. In Westchester County, flooding forced the closing of sections of the Cross County, Saw Mill River, Bronx River, Taconic and Hutchinson River Parkways, and officials in Mamaroneck ordered 20 families to evacuate two gated waterfront communities on Long Island Sound. Other families in the Washingtonville neighborhood were voluntarily evacuated to a shelter in a high school. In Nassau County, the Wantagh and Ocean Parkways were partly closed yesterday as a result of flooding, along with secondary roads in Glenhead and Syosset. Jim Callahan, the county commissioner of emergency management, voiced concern about high tides in Freeport, Long Beach, Bayville Centre Island and Glen Cove. Bayville had asked residents to evacuate voluntarily, but few people showed up at a shelter. In Patchogue, in Suffolk County, high winds ripped the roof off a building in the Fairfield Apartments, and eight families were moved to another building in the complex, said Joe Williams, commissioner of the county's office of emergency management. On Fire Island, where winds up to 50 miles an hour howled in from the ocean, more than 1,000 people voluntarily evacuated Saturday night and yesterday morning, about 50 taking the last ferry to Bay Shore at 9:20 a.m. before the ferry was shut down for the day. The Islip town supervisor, Phil Nolan, toured the island in the morning and said that fewer than 200 residents had chosen to remain. In the Rockaways, traffic lights and lamp stanchions swung wildly along Shore Front Parkway, and an occasional garbage can rolled along the Boardwalk, which was deserted except for a flock of ducks that sipped from puddles in a playground. Street signs trembled and waves lapped at the top of a retaining wall separating Beach Channel Drive from Jamaica Bay. Gov. Eliot Spitzer put 3,200 National Guard members on alert for deployment into areas of New York that were affected by the storm. State crews west of Albany were getting snowplows out of storage. In New Jersey, Richard J. Codey, the acting governor, urged residents to stay indoors, and at a late afternoon news conference said major highways had been partly or fully closed. Col. Joseph R. Fuentes, the state police commander, said, ''Every major river in the state is going to achieve flood stage or just over.'' Hundreds of car accidents were reported across the region. The rain by late yesterday had created a pond several feet deep on a service road along Route 495 East, the New Jersey approach to the Lincoln Tunnel. A red Subaru was half-submerged, a woman still at the wheel. Nearby, two men talked after their cars collided; one took a picture of the other's license plate. It might have been worse, one meteorologist noted. ''Thankfully, it's not in the winter,'' said Jim DeCarufel, a National Weather Service spokesman in Sterling, Va., who said more than 3 inches of rain fell in the Baltimore area between midnight and 1 p.m. ''If this was snow, we'd be in trouble. It would be a blizzard.'' All along the East Coast, boats were secured against pounding tidal surges, and the Coast Guard warned mariners at sea to head for port because wind-driven waves were soaring to 18 to 26 feet -- as tall as a two-story house. New York Harbor was a vast field of whitecaps, and on the coasts of New Jersey, Long Island and Connecticut, the waves thundered on the beaches. In Point Pleasant Beach, N.J., Marie Doherty, who has lived on the beach since 1977, said she was not worried about the storm. Her home, separated from the ocean by a big dune, had been flooded only once, in 1992. Storms make things exciting, she said. ''It's really the fun of living here,'' she said, standing on her porch as she watched two giant black waves crash on the beach. ''I would hate to be cooped up in an apartment in the city.'' The storm rained out Major League Baseball in the Northeast on a day when teams were to mark the 60th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's breaking the color line. In Massachusetts, where the storm was expected to diminish today, Boston and Lexington canceled events including re-enactments of Paul Revere's ride and parades to mark today's Patriot's Day holiday, which commemorates the Revolutionary War battles of Lexington and Concord. But there were no plans to cancel the 111th Boston Marathon. Power failures affected 3,400 Con Edison customers in Westchester County and New York City, 4,500 Long Island Power Authority customers, 4,000 Public Service Electric and Gas customers in New Jersey and 6,600 customers of the Connecticut Light and Power Company, the utilities reported. At least two people were killed in car accidents attributed to the weather in Connecticut and northern New York. Elsewhere, one person was reported killed in South Carolina yesterday as dozens of mobile homes were hit by high winds, and two people were missing in flash floods in West Virginia. Earlier, the storm had been blamed for five deaths in Kansas and Texas, and had spawned tornadoes in Florida and Alabama. Tracked by forecasters who compared it to a 1992 storm that killed six people in the New York region and gouged beaches, damaged homes and disrupted life for days, yesterday's blow was a genuine northeaster, churning counterclockwise up the coast, gathering strength from the Atlantic and hurling it at the land. But experts said it was the kind of storm more typical of winter. ''This storm has the traditional path and makeup of a winter northeaster,'' said Jeff Warner, a meteorologist with Pennsylvania State University. ''But it doesn't have the cold air traditional with a winter storm. This is going to be a rainstorm, although there will be some snow inland and some pretty good snow in the Adirondacks and other places in upstate New York.''"
"As residents and business owners pulled soggy wallboard and ruined furniture out into the sun on Monday, state and federal officials in New Jersey and New York toured towns hardest hit by last week's northeaster to try to determine whether federal aid would be available to them. Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey said that New Jersey had suffered $180 million in damage to private and public property in what he called the second-worst rainstorm in the state's history. To underscore the extent of the damage, he came here to the train station, which has been closed since heavy rains swelled the Raritan River last week and put many streets under water. R. David Paulison, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, who accompanied Mr. Codey, said that he had wanted to see the destruction for himself to make a comprehensive case to President Bush about the damage. And he assured officials that the request would be considered in ''days, not weeks.'' Last week Mr. Codey asked President Bush to declare several regions of New Jersey -- including parts of Bergen, Burlington, Essex, Hudson, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties -- disaster areas to qualify for federal aid . Accompanied by the state's two United States senators, Frank R. Lautenberg and Robert Menendez, and Representative Mike Ferguson, Mr. Codey recounted the flood's toll: 40,000 people without power, 3,000 evacuated from their homes, and 1,400 residents forced to flee to shelters. In addition, three deaths were attributed to the heavy rains. He warned that ''the biggest challenge lies ahead of us,'' and urged people affected by the flooding to call 211 or to sign on to 222.nj211.org. Mr. Lautenberg said he planned to speak to the Senate Appropriations Committee about the need for $30 million to speed on a flood prevention program, but he said the president's budget included only $10 million.. In response to appeals from merchants, who unlike homeowners do not receive federal emergency funds, Mr. Codey raised the possibility of a bond issue to buy out businesses that have been damaged by multiple floods. In New York, Mr. Paulison began his tour of the flood-ravaged areas on Monday in Mamaroneck, in Westchester County, where he met with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, homeowners and the minister of the First Baptist Church, which was heavily damaged by floodwaters. The county executive, Andrew J. Spano, Representative Nita M. Lowey and Senator Clinton said they planned to start a charity for flood victims while they awaited word on whether 12 counties in New York State -- including Westchester, Nassau, Suffolk and all of New York City -- would be declared a disaster area. Preliminary assessments indicated that New York State sustained about $36 million in storm damage. In Connecticut, Philip Mikan, of the state Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, said additional days were needed before an official estimate of damages could be made."
"Residents who endured this spring's flooding in Westchester are about to witness the follow-up phenomenon: the outbreak of ''summit meetings,'' op-ed articles and, inevitably, flood-control studies that gather dust because their remedies are too costly and too wrenching to enact. All this bustling inaction threatens to add another layer of disappointment to what is already a federally-certified disaster. And not just any disaster -- a recurrent one that people brace for whenever the skies open up above the county's dense encrustation of highways, driveways, rooftops and parking lots, sending down torrents that cannot go where they should, and thus improvise, making lakes in basements or a rolling river between the shoulders of the Bronx River Parkway. Nearly 20 years ago, an essay in this section by William G. Lawyer, then director of the Greenburgh Nature Center, took note of the drastic changes made to the Mamaroneck River watershed (also known as New Rochelle, Purchase, Scarsdale, Rye, etc.) An area once bound tightly to its river with mills and waterworks treated the ecosystem as an afterthought. Riverbeds shrank as highways widened. Ponds were drained for houses. Where the river was buried or walled in, it was forgotten. But some places, like Mamaroneck Village, remained where they had always been -- on low-lying ground. A month ago it would have been a stretch to mention Mamaroneck and New Orleans in the same breath. But both communities are victims of foolish planning and development. Once Mamaroneck's paperwork starts flowing, it, too, will get visitors from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. And both areas would benefit greatly from ecologically sensitive planning, including a wholesale restoration of flood-absorbing wetlands. It may be impossible to dismantle suburbia, but we should be able to improve on it, even in an area with independent, noncooperating governments. Restoring wetlands, improving drainage, banning ill-placed development, curbing sprawl -- none of this is profoundly complicated, but it does require action by leaders more used to short-term fixes and penny-wise spending. April's floods are a regional problem requiring regional solutions, and it shouldn't take any more deadly northeasters to get officials across Westchester and in Albany to tackle it together. Westchester"
"SUBURBAN basements are repositories of ambivalence. There's that frayed armchair you were about to throw out, but no, maybe your daughter will need it after she moves out. And those file boxes of term papers -- remnants of that hopeful being you were decades ago. Maybe someday you'll need them to seem knowledgeable at the book club. Those drums that filled the house with a clattering and pounding that drove the family crazy? In your empty nest, what you wouldn't give to have your children bang them to their hearts' content. Store them, too, in the basement. But all that hemming and hawing comes to the surface -- quite literally -- when there's a once-in-a-decade event like the northeaster two weeks ago that turned basements in the working-class Washingtonville neighborhood of Mamaroneck into sewage tanks and gave residents a small taste of what New Orleans must have been like circa Katrina. Arrayed on sidewalks over the following days for all to see were the ratty armchair, the file boxes, the drums, and so much mucky more, waiting for the garbage guys to decisively dispose of them forever. Two days after the storm, Bob Comblo, a 50-year-old contractor, was pumping out the basement of the small apartment house on Hillside Avenue where he lives and does the superintending and where three feet of water had collected. As his pump roared, Mr. Comblo talked about the motorized Jeeps that his son, Bobbie, 13, had relished driving until he was 5 and that Mr. Comblo was saving for his grandchild, Tatiana. ''They cost me $550 apiece -- they were brand new,'' he said. ''Now I have to throw them out.'' Floods can be a great leveler, inundating basements in million-dollar homes in the Orienta section as well as Washingtonville, but the repairs put more of a dent in the bank accounts of the 10 tenants in Mr. Comblo's building. ''Elderly people, middle class, working class -- we're not rich,'' he said. Basements are also repositories of memories -- underground museums of a sort. Mary Lou Greco, who lives on Center Avenue, held on to the mirror in which her three daughters successively gazed at themselves as they blossomed into women. There it was on the sidewalk, its glass coated with a film of mud, huddled near the now-grimy Christmas lights and Halloween masks that brought the block so many seasons of cheer. Mrs. Greco did salvage a muddied photograph of a grandson, Anthony, when he was 2 -- he is now 15 -- the frame adorned with the words ''I love my Grandma.'' George Belsito, 55, a water department worker, was standing in rubber boots and hosing down what looked like a lake of white paint outside his Hillside Avenue home. He rescued what he could, but the overflow from the usually bashful Mamaroneck River was too swift. ''The water surrounded the house like a peninsula,'' Mr. Belsito said. ''I was a peninsula.'' Four feet of water ruined his washing machine, tools, old fishing rods and treadmill. ''I'm chubby, but I still work out,'' he said, chuckling. Bunched along with those throwaways on the sidewalk were his 33-r.p.m. vinyl discs (once known as records), which brought to mind Mr. Belsito as a young man in the 1970s dancing the night away to Gladys Knight and the Pips. Those objects can all be replaced. ''The hard part was losing all the stuff from my children -- the tapes of the communion, the children playing in the park,'' he said. ''Everything is gone.'' Christine is now 28, and Stephanie is 24, but the delightful evidence that they had once been capering girls was on those tapes. Of course, some basements are museums in waiting -- the children are still playing with all those Barbie dolls and plastic stoves that will inevitably wind up in cartons. That's why seeing Estella Mendoza standing outside the tall gray clapboard on Madison Street that she bought in November, surrounded by black plastic bags of toys, was so disheartening. Mrs. Mendoza emigrated from Mexico 15 years ago and works as a housekeeper at a Rye country club (where her husband, Luis, does maintenance). The house had been an immigrant's dream, and she and Luis had just refinished the basement into a playroom for Evelyn 7, and Luis Alexis, 5. Now she was throwing out new Barbies, a toy laptop and miniature kitchen appliances. They were soaked with mud and worse, as were the playroom's leather couch, dresser and VCR. Her neighbor Luis Torres, a truck driver, also lost his basement, which he had adapted for his mother-in-law. Her double bed, television and microwave were deluged. Searching the dank, darkened basement with a flashlight, Mr. Torres cheerfully said he could replace the furnishings. What he can't replace is the videotaped chronicle of his daughter, Maggie, soon after she was born. Maggie is now 13. ''That is something you never have back again,'' he said.

"THE Aristocrat Dry Cleaners in Hartsdale has been closed since the basement flooded to the ceiling in the April 15 northeaster, damaging or destroying much of the equipment. But that doesn't mean it isn't doing business. Phil Benincasa Jr. continued to serve customers last week by expanding pick-up and drop-off service as much as possible and benefiting from the kindness of another dry cleaner, who let him use his site to clean and press clothes. ''We must have one of the best clienteles ever,'' said Mr. Benincasa, who runs the business with his father. ''Every single one of them has been so understanding and so supportive through this horrible ordeal.'' But he was not nearly as enthusiastic about the low-interest loans offered to businesses -- up to $1.5 million at a rate of as low as 4 percent -- as part of the federal disaster declaration that was made on Tuesday. ''We need aid, not low-interest loans,'' said Mr. Benincasa, who said he had not bought flood insurance because his business was not in an area that typically floods. Other business owners in the county had a similar reaction after being notified of the disaster declaration at a meeting in Mamaroneck on Tuesday. ''I'm not looking for low-interest loans,'' said Frank Picone, owner of Picone Meat Specialties in Mamaroneck. ''FEMA is missing the point. This was an act of God, and when it's an act of God, they should help cover the losses.'' Under the disaster declaration, individuals and households are eligible for up to $28,200 in financial aid related to loss of housing and property. Individuals may also be eligible for low-interest loans of up to $200,000 for structure damage and $40,000 on contents. The rate for those loans is as low as 2.875 percent, said Ed Conley, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Mr. Picone estimated that he sustained about $750,000 in damages -- including a piece of machinery that cost $150,000 and had been used for only three days -- but his flood insurance would cover only about $250,000. ''If I didn't have good credit, I would be out of business,'' he said. Mr. Conley noted that individuals who receive assistance from the federal government are asked to get flood insurance. Business and home owners who receive loans of more than $10,000, or are located in a 100-year flood plain, are required to obtain flood insurance. The emergency management agency has been encouraging residents and businesses to get flood insurance, particularly with hurricane season starting June 1 and another active season predicted. Mr. Conley said that every community in Westchester participates in the National Flood Insurance Program, which assures that such coverage is available. In addition, property owners who are not in flood-prone areas are encouraged to look for so-called preferred risk policies, which provide such coverage at reduced rates. But business owners in Mamaroneck say that flood insurance can be costly and that caps on the amount of coverage -- in some cases $10,000 to $15,000 -- can make it nearly worthless. Many business and property owners in Mamaroneck and other parts of the county called on local, state and federal officials to begin addressing drainage problems that were exposed in the storm this month and one on March 2. Several merchants at the meeting Tuesday in Mamaroneck also complained of sewage backups that occurred before the most recent flooding. Those seeking federal assistance can call 1-800-621-FEMA (1-800-621-3362) or go to fema.gov. In addition, village officials said, the United Way is serving as a clearinghouse for information and donations; residents can call 211 or (800) 899-1479, the number that cable phone customers must use. David Currie, the local director for the United Way in Westchester, said those in need could also go to St. Thomas Episcopal Church at 168 West Boston Post Road from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. tomorrow and Tuesday to meet with case workers. STORM RECOVERY"
"DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER was president and global warming was unheard of in 1960 when Congress authorized a massive storm-protection project for an 83-mile stretch of Long Island's South Shore, from Fire Island Inlet to Montauk Point. Now, after decades of false starts and shelved plans, the United States Army Corps of Engineers has completed a study for the project and is discussing alternatives for proceeding with a long list of government agencies. What may emerge would be the largest shoreline resculpturing project undertaken in this country, costing hundreds of millions of dollars yet still incapable of protecting barrier islands and the South Shore mainland from devastation should a monster hurricane strike, officials involved with the project say. The project would be designed to last for 50 years, and the Army Corps and others are grappling with how much they should factor in the rise in sea level projected by many experts because of global warming. Work would probably not begin until 2010, 50 years after it was first authorized. The study now looks only at water levels over the past century. But that may change, the corps said, and the study could be expanded to consider the environmental and economic impacts of a storm in the class of Hurricane Katrina and what is now seen as the higher probability of such a storm's striking Long Island. While building a towering seawall the entire 83-mile length would be all that could help in severe storms, no shoreline armoring is on the table. At its most aggressive limits, the project would move mountains of sand, build dune lines, broaden beaches, jigger with inlets and set policy for what to do when breaches open in the barrier islands. The plan will also most likely call for reinforcing houses and other structures in flood-prone areas, removing them or moving them to safer ground. All the efforts will be to reduce storm, erosion and flooding damage to tens of thousands of homes and businesses in a 71-square-mile area reaching as far inland as Montauk Highway and Sunrise Highway. Clifford S. Jones of the corps' New York district office, who is the reformulation project manager, said a yearlong process of reaching consensus on the best way forward had begun. He said the public would get its first inkling of what may be in store at meetings toward the end of this year or soon after. ''We are winnowing down the alternatives to come up with something the corps, the state, the federal agencies, Suffolk County and the towns and villages can all agree on,'' Mr. Jones said. ''And that's going to be a huge effort.'' The corps was accused of failing to build levees properly in New Orleans, where flooding and ruin after Katrina in 2005 have changed how the corps will proceed with future projects. Corps officials will seek broad public support and scrutiny of a final plan for Long Island's South Shore. They will also submit that plan and the studies supporting it to an outside agency, which has yet to be selected, for an independent technical review. The study -- formally the Fire Island to Montauk Point Reformulation Study (the ''reformulation'' is from a plan rejected in 1978) -- calculates impacts from postulated storms and hurricanes and the protection that a variety of projects could provide. The project area, entirely in Suffolk County, encompasses ocean and bay shores and some 70 percent of Long Island's ocean beaches. It includes the 26-mile Fire Island National Seashore and its summer communities; parts of the Towns of Babylon, Islip, Brookhaven, Southampton and East Hampton; and incorporated villages. On Fire Island, no plan can be approved without the consent of the Department of the Interior, the parent agency of the National Park Service and its Fire Island National Seashore. In the past, the corps, the Fire Island summer communities and the seashore have had very different views on what is best for the beaches. A ''vision statement'' that the seashore regards as a road map for any project calls for natural processes like shifting sand to be unimpeded as much as possible and for dune and long-term beach replenishment to be minimized. The seashore is also determined that no project be tailored to benefit property owners who want their houses protected. Michael T. Reynolds, the seashore superintendent, said ''there will be a variety of trade-offs that will need to be made, with winners and losers both.'' The Fire Island Association, a property owners' group, will want assurances that the project will protect the beaches fronting summer communities. Doing that, it argues, will be cheaper than paying to remove houses. Traditionally the federal government pays about 65 percent of the cost of shoreline projects. The state, Suffolk County and local governments would split the rest. If agreement can be reached on what to do along the entire 83 miles of shore, another challenge will be financing, said Representative Timothy H. Bishop, a Democrat from Southampton. ''That fight will be difficult,'' he said, ''and it's difficult to know what other fiscal realities we may be facing.'' Mr. Bishop said he did not expect an appropriation before 2010. ''If we're still in Iraq then, that may well have an impact,'' he said. Representative Steve Israel, a Democrat of Dix Hills, said he had assurances that the corps would release a preliminary draft by the end of 2007 and a proposed final action plan by the end of 2008. ''We are beginning to see the light at the end of a 40-year tunnel,'' he said, ''but like all dark tunnels, you don't know what you have got until you come out.'' SHIFTING SAND"
"President Bush declared parts of New Jersey a federal disaster area yesterday as a result of heavy rain and flooding almost two weeks ago. The designation will enable flood victims to apply for grants for temporary housing and home repairs as well as for low-cost loans to cover uninsured losses. Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey had requested that the entire state be declared a federal disaster area, but for now the aid will be available only in six counties -- Bergen, Burlington, Essex, Passaic, Somerset and Union. Mr. Codey estimated that New Jersey sustained $180 million in damage from the rain on April 15 and 16, which left 40,000 people without power and forced 3,000 people from their homes. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, more counties may become eligible for federal disaster relief after damage surveys are completed, and aid may become available for government facilities damaged by the storm. ''In the near future, we expect that as we complete the remaining assessments, there will be additional counties designated,'' Mr. Codey said. ''We intend to continue working with FEMA to push for a statewide disaster declaration so that we can ensure that all New Jerseyans who are in need receive assistance as quickly as possible,'' he added. On Tuesday, the president designated as disaster areas three counties in New York that were affected by the same storm -- Orange, Rockland and Westchester. Mayor Angelo Corradino of Manville, in Somerset County, called yesterday's declaration ''a godsend.'' ''We wouldn't have survived if we didn't have it,'' Mayor Corradino said, noting that 600 of the 10,400 homes in the borough were damaged. ''Spirits are good, but with the president declaring a disaster area, that will lift their spirits even more.'' Residents and business owners in the six designated counties who sustained flood damage can register for assistance at www.fema.gov or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA (1-800-621-3362)."
"EARL GRUBBS of Cranberry Township, Pa., hadn't even arrived home from the dealership with his new car before the air bag warning light came on. It was last October, and he had just bought a used 2005 Buick LaCrosse CSX with only 45 miles on the odometer for $20,000. Mr. Grubbs, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, thought he had gotten a great deal on a car that cost about $30,000 new. It was a certified General Motors used car, and a Carfax vehicle history report showed that the Buick had never been damaged. But like the telltale heart of the Edgar Allan Poe story, the air bag light linked the car to its troubled past. Mr. Grubbs had bought the car far from, and about a year after, the hurricanes that devastated the Gulf Coast. Still, when he took the car to be repaired at a Buick dealership near his suburban Pittsburgh home, he said the service staff traced the car to a Buick dealer in Florida, where the staff told him several vehicles had been damaged by Hurricane Wilma. Mr. Grubbs's car had been one of them. According to an e-mail message from G.M. that Mr. Grubbs received after he complained to the company, his Buick had been damaged by flying debris during the storm, and body work had been done on the front fenders, the front doors, the hood, the roof panel and the trunk. Also, the windshield had been replaced. ''I negotiated on a vehicle without knowing what had happened to it,'' Mr. Grubbs said. George Bowling, owner of Waynesburg Carriage, where Mr. Grubbs bought the car, said in an interview that his dealership had bought the Buick at a G.M.-sponsored auction and was not told it had been damaged. Carfax estimates that about 500,000 vehicles were damaged in Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005. Consumer groups, political leaders and car dealers said they were concerned that some of the cars would be repaired and resold through a practice known as title-washing, by which a vehicle with a flood or salvage title in one state is issued a new, clean title in another. An analysis of motor vehicle records from September 2005 to August 2006 by Experian Automotive, which also provides vehicle histories, showed that 15,000 vehicles damaged by the hurricanes were retitled in other states, with 45 percent, or 7,000, getting clean titles. ''A number of these cars are unsafe and shouldn't be on the roads,'' Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, said in a news release in February when he introduced a bill that would make it harder to sell such vehicles. ''And folks are overpaying for vehicles they believe are mechanically sound. To the untrained eye, they appear to be in good shape.'' The problem for consumers is that it is hard to determine a vehicle's history, even with the best efforts. Many consumers confine their sleuthing to buying vehicle-history reports from companies like Carfax, but those reports depend on data provided by state motor vehicle departments and other sources. Dealers and lawyers said this information was often incomplete or out of date. Mr. Grubbs's car, for example, still earned a clean report from Carfax and Experian's AutoCheck service in February. In January, Carfax settled a class-action lawsuit regarding its advertising by agreeing, among other things, to provide a clear warning on its Web site that its vehicle histories may be incomplete. ''We've always been very clear that the Carfax report is only one tool that consumers should use,'' said Larry Gamache, the company's communications director. Mr. Grubbs's experience seems to be rare. While consumer groups and government watchdogs are on the lookout for cases like it, more than a year and a half after the hurricanes there have been few complaints about hurricane-damaged cars. William L. Brauch, director for consumer protection for the Iowa attorney general's office who works on automobile issues for the National Association of Attorneys General, said the association had not heard one hurricane-related car complaint. If there had been some, he said, ''It's likely we would have heard about it.'' Rosemary Shahan, president of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety in Sacramento, said consumers could have bought hurricane-damaged cars without knowing it in what she called salvage fraud, where cars that insurers have declared total losses are repaired and resold without the seller disclosing the damage. A. Jayson Adair, the president of Copart, an auto salvage company based in Fairfield, Calif., said he doubted that any of the Katrina cars his company auctioned ended up back on the road. He said most were older models and had been badly flooded, not candidates for rebuilding or resale. He said the cars were sold to recyclers for scrap or to dismantlers for parts. ''They were junk,'' he said. ''I get a kick out of reading that people are driving around in Katrina cars. Dismantlers and recyclers bought them.'' Soon after Katrina hit on Aug. 29, 2005, Copart converted 180 acres of a cow pasture near Gulfport, Miss., into a salvage yard, storing 30,000 vehicles collected after the hurricane. In a 2006 report, subtitled ''The Katrina Story,'' the company recounted its efforts to process and sell the vehicles from a hurriedly assembled trailer city in the pasture, housing hundreds of employees brought in from around the country. Copart, which auctions cars for insurance companies seeking to recoup their losses on vehicles that have been declared a total loss, said it sold about 65,000 vehicles damaged by Katrina from this lot and others, and crushed another 10,000. In an effort to ensure that flood-ruined cars are indeed destroyed, Louisiana passed a law in late 2005 requiring that a certificate of destruction, not a title, is issued on a vehicle that has been declared a total loss by its insurer after being flooded in a state-declared disaster. Vehicles issued these certificates can only be crushed or sold for parts. (Of course, even a certificate of destruction is no guarantee a car won't reappear. As of last week, someone on eBay was selling details on how to upgrade a certificate of destruction so a car could be put back on the road.) The law was sponsored by State Representative M. J. Smiley Jr., who said he wanted to stop title-washing. ''I knew that if I didn't do this bill, dealers would be getting so many complaints because of electrical malfunctions and air bags and antilock brakes,'' said Mr. Smiley, who is also a used car dealer. The law took effect on Dec. 6, 2005, but Mr. Smiley said, ''A lot of cars got taken out of Louisiana in anticipation of the bill.'' Some consumer and trade groups said they thought that the only reliable safeguard would be federal legislation compelling insurance companies to disclose information about vehicles declared total losses, including the date and odometer reading, the primary reason for the declaration and whether the air bag had deployed. Senator Lott reintroduced such a bill last month after Congress failed to act on it last year. David W. Regan, vice president for legislative affairs of the National Automobile Dealers Association, said his group supported the Lott bill because ''we think there are instances every year in which vehicles declared a total loss are not retitled as salvage or flooded, and dealers want to know what they're buying at auctions. ''There is concern because there are reports that Katrina vehicles are circulating at the wholesale level,'' he added, where reconditioned cars are auctioned to dealers. And sometimes the cars keep circulating at the consumer level. Mr. Grubbs got a refund in February from Waynesburg Carriage. G.M. also paid his legal fees. But after the Buick was returned to the dealer, it was put on the market again. A salesman at Waynesburg said Thursday that the car was sold more than a week ago, with full disclosure about the hurricane damage. MOTORING"
"The worst moment in the past five days for William Borger came at the end of the boat ride that took him from dry land to his house on North Road in the Hoffman Grove section. He needed his blood pressure medicine from the house, where the basement was entirely flooded and the first floor had 13 inches of water. But he needed Gunner and Magnum, his German shepherds, more. ''When we pulled the boat up to the house, I didn't hear them,'' he said, his eyes filling up recalling how he missed their usual baying and barking. The last time he had seen Magnum, on Monday morning, he had been bleeding around his eyes after rubbing them raw against the sofa, possibly from irritation from the flood water. Then he heard Magnum, and he stopped worrying, he said, knowing Gunner was ''too bullheaded'' to get sick. ''This is my family, and you know what? I can't lose them,'' he said, as he led the two toward his parked car on Meadow Road on Thursday afternoon. With this waterlogged township of 54,000 in Passaic County trying to recover from a punishing northeaster over the weekend and flood waters from the Passaic and Pompton Rivers, residents gave accounts of loss, resigned to waiting several more days before they could set foot in their basements again without waders. Around New Jersey, there were still more than 1,000 residents living in shelters while Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey as well as Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York awaited word on whether the two states would be declared federal disaster areas. That would enable them to receive aid to clean up and to help residents driven from their homes. Inspectors from the Federal Emergency Management Agency roamed New York, New Jersey and Connecticut on Thursday assessing the damage, though it was not always easy because sections of highway remained flooded. For Mr. Borger, the aid will not come soon enough. He said the boat that dropped him off at his house on Monday night did not pick him up again as promised, so he slept on his soggy couch with the dogs and no heat. ''It was tight, but we made it,'' he said. He called town officials three times by cellphone, he said -- his electricity was dead -- but they explained to him that they had to rescue humans before animals, so he waited. On Tuesday morning he tried to get a pair of dry pants, then remembered he had rearranged his bureau and the pants were now in the bottom drawer, under water. That day, Mr. Borger said, a neighbor in a small plastic boat rescued him but could not take the dogs. And so he spent Wednesday trying to find a ride out for Gunner and Magnum. Late Thursday morning, two young people in a boat helped him rescue the pair. He bent over Magnum, who sniffed him. ''You wouldn't leave me, would you?'' he said. ''You're my good boy.'' In the flood-prone Hoffman Grove section, more than 30 neighbors have recently taken buyouts from the township rather than endure another flood. But he said that for him, the nearly $200,000 that was offered to a neighbor would not be enough for him. So he plans to clean up and stay. ''We got a nightmare,'' he said, ticking off washer, dryer, refrigerator, electrical outlets, carpets and floors -- all ruined. ''This one was definitely devastating.'' On Sunday afternoon, David Chapman, 43, who owns Stanley Taylor Stationers, off Route 23 here, moved mailing labels, printer cartridges, toner and other office supplies he sells about three and a half feet off the floor of his basement storage room. When he came to work Monday morning, the water was only 10 inches high, and he felt lucky. On Tuesday morning, the water reached the doorknob, and although he figured he had lost some inventory, he said he was relieved because at least the rain had stopped. But by Wednesday, the water was lapping at the landing of the stairs to the basement, and he realized too late that he should have emptied the 1,500-square-foot room. He estimates he lost as much as $50,000 in stock. ''We won't know until we start to pull everything out,'' Mr. Chapman said. And although he said he lost a lot of merchandise in 2005, he lamented on Thursday that ''this is the worst ever,'' as he headed toward the basement, where cardboard boxes had been submerged under about six feet of water. A pump was slowly belching water out of the basement and into the parking lot. He batted at a mosquito hovering over the water. ''It's horrific,'' Mr. Chapman said. ''If I'd have known Sunday afternoon, I would have brought everything up here. I moved the business from New York City after 9/11, and came here thinking I'd get a new start. It's unbelievable.'' Next door to Mr. Chapman's office, on Mountain View Boulevard, the Miller family was wondering what to do with the waterlogged water bed in their basement. John Miller, who does not work because of a bad back, surveyed his flooded backyard, the discarded yellow insulation, the ruined silver Honda that had worked last week, the old swing set that barely cleared the water. ''Downstairs is a total loss,'' he said. One of his sons, Tom, 17, wore plastic bags over his feet to keep them dry in their boots. His pajama pants were wet almost to the knees. His 16-year-old daughter, Ashley, wore slippers and pajamas. Mr. Miller, 48, wore camouflage hip boots, but they had not been tall enough to keep him dry in his basement, where five feet of water covered the family's new boiler, installed after the flood in 2005. The water heater was also ruined, as were a stereo and rugs. Mr. Miller said he had asked local officials to clean out the clogged storm drain in his backyard before the flood, but it was never done. ''Today we're just cleaning up, hoping for the best that we won't get any more rain,'' he said. ''I've had enough. With this one, I'm done. I'm going to move up north.''"
"From Mamaroneck and New Rochelle in Westchester County to Bound Brook and Lodi in New Jersey, the New York City region took stock and mopped up on Tuesday from one of the rainiest April storms on record. More than 900 Bound Brook residents were still in shelters, and about 3,000 people statewide were without electricity on Tuesday afternoon, said acting Gov. Richard J. Codey, who has asked President Bush to declare flood-stricken New Jersey as a national disaster area. Two people died from the flooding, and a third was reported missing. In Lodi, a suburb in Bergen County that was among the hardest-hit towns in the region, Evelyn Mitchell, 61, was collecting important papers from her mud-soaked basement apartment on North Main Street after the Saddle River had flooded its banks. ''Everything's gone,'' said Ms. Mitchell, pointing toward her overturned refrigerator, soaked mattress and damaged computer printer, a recent birthday present. The floodwater in her apartment toppled furniture and created a four-foot-high water line that left the cream-colored walls lighter below it than above. But the figurines and pictures of her grandchildren remained carefully arranged on higher shelves. ''Thank God for family,'' she said as she headed for her son's home in Rahway, N.J. Lester Williams, 50, another resident in Ms. Mitchell's 27-unit building, was even worse off. ''We lost everything,'' said Mr. Williams, a single parent. His children, Sandrell, 7, and Swalik, 5, who sat patiently outside in the family's silver Grand Prix, would normally have been in class at Washington School, across Main Street. But the elementary school was one of many across the state that remained closed for a second day, and fire hoses snaked from inside the building's front doors, disgorging floodwater. ''I don't know what move to make from here,'' Mr. Williams said. ''I'm so lost I don't know what to do right now.'' In his apartment, a picture of his niece, two Matchbox cars and a puzzle piece sat on a bureau near the kitchen, a soggy still life. The storm killed Niranjankumar Soni, 52, of Edison, who was trapped in a car in a flooded underpass in Woodbridge, and Nicholas Pennucci, 79, of Bloomfield, who apparently drowned next to his car on a flooded street in Belleville. In Mahwah, the police were searching the Ramapo River on Tuesday for Mary Pat Wagner, 43, who was last seen driving home from a party on Saturday night. Along a river bank near Route 202, the police had found a side-view mirror that may have come from her car, Capt. Stephen Jaffe of the Mahwah police told The Associated Press. Mr. Codey, who declared a state of emergency on Monday, said that most of the major rivers in New Jersey, including the Delaware and the Raritan, had crested and were receding on Tuesday afternoon. On Wednesday, his office said, Mr. Codey planned to take an aerial tour to assess the damage. In Mamaroneck, where more than seven inches of rain fell Sunday and Monday, merchants on Tuesday were clearing out the soggy remnants of their stores. A. J. Martello, the owner of a pump and drain company in nearby Port Chester, was charging $600 an hour for a pump that can drain 1,600 gallons an hour. He said business was booming. ''This is the worst I've ever seen, and I thought the last was the worst,'' Mr. Martello said. ''Look at the devastation. It's like our little Hurricane Katrina.'' Officials in Westchester County urged flood victims to document damage and contact their town or the county about losses so that officials could provide a detailed picture as they apply for federal aid. In Mamaroneck, National Guard troops were stationed at stoplights along Mamaroneck Avenue, which was lined with trucks from utility companies and various fire departments that were assisting homeowners and businesses that had been flooded. Mayor Philip Trifiletti estimated that damage in his village alone would run in the tens of millions of dollars. Mr. Trifiletti said that as of Tuesday morning, about 100 Mamaroneck residents remained in shelters, though he said he hoped to have 99 percent of them back in their homes by the weekend. ''For everything to return to normal, I think will take two to three weeks at least,'' he said. Several major roads in New York and New Jersey also were still flooded Tuesday. A five-mile stretch of the Bronx River Parkway -- from the Sprain Brook Parkway to Scarsdale Road in Yonkers -- was closed. In New Jersey, 14 stretches of highway were partly shut down or closed, though the number was down from 70 such sections on Monday. The receding water revealed swaths of devastation from Fire Island, where houses teetered on their stilts on a washed-away beach, to Staten Island, where a retaining wall was washed away and left five multifamily homes deserted and in danger of collapsing. Through the rain and the flood and the muck, there was one silver lining. In New Jersey, residents affected by the storm were assured of an additional two days to file their federal and state tax returns, which must be postmarked by midnight Thursday and marked ''April 16 storm.'' School board elections also were postponed in Bound Brook, Manville and Fairfield Township; no makeup dates had been set. Mike Yaple, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association, said the last time elections were postponed was in 1982, when a blizzard crippled the northern part of the state. For the second day, classes were canceled at the Piscataway and New Brunswick campuses of Rutgers University. In Lodi, Ms. Mitchell -- who had been doing her spring cleaning before the floodwater came -- said she would be looking for a new apartment. ''Two floods is enough,'' she said. ''I'm not waiting for another.''"
"Stand atop any levee in the New Orleans area, and one question will offer itself, unbidden, to the mind: Is this pile of dirt tall enough to stand up to the next storm? The answer is complex, and a wary city has been waiting to hear it. After the New Orleans hurricane protection system failed under the onslaught of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Army Corps of Engineers rethought the way it assesses hurricane risk. It devised new, flexible computer models and ran countless simulations on Defense Department supercomputers to help it understand what kind of storms the region can expect, how the current protection system might perform against them, and what defenses will be needed in the future. Skeptics say the corps has bitten off more than its supercomputers can chew. And in fact, the effort to produce what the corps calls its risk and reliability report has long passed its original deadline of June 1, 2006. Last week, its publication was delayed yet again, into mid-June. If all goes as planned, the color-coded maps and tables in the report will also help residents know whether their living rooms are likely to be wet or dry in the storms to come -- and even whether they want to commit to staying in their city or pull up stakes. Ed Link, director of the official corps investigation into the levee failures and a professor of engineering at the University of Maryland, said that while ''everyone's frustrated with how long it's taken, especially us,'' the agency would deliver the report only ''when we have confidence that it's the right information.'' ''Misinformation is a whole lot worse than no information,'' Dr. Link said. The new methods employed by the corps have already been adopted by the other government agencies most interested in hurricanes and flooding: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which runs the National Flood Insurance Program and will use the data in its flood maps. It is the first time all three agencies have agreed on a common method of assessing such risks for the Gulf Coast. Eventually, Dr. Link suggested, it may be used by all of them nationwide. The corps has all but completed the initial work of patching the damage done to the network of levees, floodwalls, gates and pumps. But as some work continues, there has been a lull in moving on to the next major step: raising the level of protection to meet the challenge of a 100-year storm, the kind of hurricane that might have a 1-in-100 chance of occurring in any given year. The new report will provide the estimates of the kind of storms that could be expected at intervals of up to 500 years, and the damage and flooding they can be expected to produce. And it will help to develop proposals for protection systems against the strongest storms. The report is an important prelude to the design process. Walter O. Baumy Jr., the chief of the engineering division for the New Orleans district of the corps, said the agency had not been sitting around waiting for the report, but had been designing structures for the next round of building based on the best estimates available. If necessary, he went on, the designs will be altered ''when those numbers get finalized.'' Col. Jeffrey A. Bedey, commander of the corps' Hurricane Protection Office in New Orleans, said the extra time had allowed the corps to learn from the mistakes of the past. ''There's a tremendous opportunity,'' he said, ''to show this isn't the same old corps.'' No one disputes that the old way of doing business did not work. The New Orleans levees and floodwalls were built to withstand a hypothetical storm called the standard project hurricane, a model developed with the Weather Bureau beginning in 1959 and based largely on data drawn from previous storms. The standard project hurricane was a hypothetical construct that may have been the state of the art at the time, but is ''very simplistic'' by today's standards, Dr. Link said. The old model was limited by the shortage of data on older storms and is essentially a static set of values, Dr. Link said, adding, ''You pull a hurricane out of a box and you stick it down at landfall.'' That did not show the complex behavior of a real storm, which produces surge and waves that have profound effects on coastal areas in the days before it actually hits land. After Hurricane Katrina, an outside panel from the American Society of Civil Engineers pushed the corps to come up with a new system based less on history than on the broader range of statistical probabilities -- the kind of tools commonly used today to determine, for example, how a building will fare in an earthquake. ''Without a statistically valid approach'' to evaluating risk that goes beyond the old methods, the panel wrote to the corps in March 2006, ''no rational hurricane protection system can result.'' The chairman, David E. Daniel, president of the University of Texas at Dallas, said the effort ''may well represent the most complex risk analysis ever undertaken for a major metropolitan area.'' The work has been done under the supervision of Donald T. Resio at the corps' Engineer Research and Development Center in Vicksburg, Miss. Dr. Resio, a computer scientist with a sunny, professional air, works in the ephemeral world of code and screens in a place that has its roots in soil, steel and concrete. He had been working on long-term risk assessment projects with NOAA and FEMA and academic and industry experts when the storms came, and he approached the leadership of the corps and offered to adapt the work his team had been doing to the urgent task at hand. ''I went to headquarters,'' he recalled, ''and said, 'If you want this done right, this is how it can be done.' '' He recalled saying something else as well: ''I told them, 'It's difficult; it's tedious.' '' Since then, he said, ''we've been burning 80-, 100-hour weeks for so long we've lost track of them.'' The model uses chains of computer programs, each feeding into the other some of the data from historical storms and hypothetical future storms, setting up ranges of intensity, size, path, forward speed and other variables. These factors, blended together, produce data on the kinds of wind, storm surge and waves that can be expected to strike the shore, and how much rain can be expected. All of those elements of the model are then applied to the digital re-creations of local geography and the man-made structures of the region. Now, Dr. Resio said, ''we have come miles this year in our understanding of hurricane behavior and hurricane probability in the Gulf of Mexico.'' Dr. Link said the group had found, for example, that storms in the Gulf do not behave randomly and come to shore anywhere, but are likeliest to follow certain sets of paths -- with New Orleans getting more than a random share of storms. And though much hurricane analysis relies on the handy Saffir-Simpson scale of storm strength, the size of a storm can be as important as its intensity in producing surge and waves. Despite its destructiveness, Katrina was just a Category 3 storm when it hit Mississippi, with winds that hit New Orleans only in the range of Category 1 or 2, but because it was more powerful when it was farther out in the Gulf, it generated a battering surge near 30 feet in some areas. Most important, Dr. Link said, the new method lays the groundwork for finding the best way to protect a coast, and moves away from the old habit of evaluating projects largely on the basis of cost-benefit analysis. He added that the model was flexible enough to incorporate new information in the future, as global climate change affects hurricanes. The biggest remaining question about the effort, however, is whether it will be accurate. Much of the delay has come down to attempts to reduce the levels of uncertainty throughout the series of calculations. Robert S. Young, a coastal geologist at Western Carolina University, said the project, while worthy, would not succeed because there is still precious little data on the behavior of storms in the Gulf. Given the variability of nature, he said, devising a predictive model ''is nearly impossible.'' ''All of the modeling and prediction they're doing is just guesswork,'' he went on. ''I'm not sure that is better than nothing.'' Orrin H. Pilkey, an emeritus professor of geology at Duke University, said ''undue confidence in these models'' could lead to a false sense of security about the hurricane protection system. Dr. Link acknowledges that it is hard to come up with meaningful data but says it is important to try. ''You can wring your hands and say, 'Woe is me!,' '' he said, or ''use the best projections that you can and try to inform yourself.'' The dispute is familiar to anyone who works in the world of complex computer modeling. Francine Berman, director of the San Diego Supercomputer Center, said the data should be rich, the model should be accurate and the computer should be powerful to provide truly useful information that can be validated. ''At the end of the day, a bad model is just interesting math,'' she said. ''These complex models are incredibly hard to get right. The first time out, it's very unlikely that you're going to get an accurate enough model, but you have to start with the best representational model you can come up with and iteratively improve it over years, decades -- even centuries.'' An enormous amount of the recent work of the risk and reliability team has been translating the data into a form that the average person can understand. Donald E. Powell, President Bush's coordinator for Gulf Coast rebuilding, said in an interview that he tells corps officials, ''Put it in language my mama can understand.'' But the ultimate message is likely to be that despite the billions of dollars being spent to improve hurricane protection for New Orleans, it remains a city in the cross hairs for dangerous storms. Dr. Daniel, the University of Texas at Dallas president, said, ''It doesn't take a sophisticated risk analysis tool to say it's a risky place.''"
"THE Big Top toy store on East Hartsdale Avenue reopened May 11 just as signs were being stripped from the shuttered HSBC Bank nearby. Both businesses were closed after being damaged by flooding in the northeaster that ripped through Westchester on April 15. While owners of the Big Top decided to reinvest, HSBC is taking its business elsewhere, a reflection of the struggling state of the shopping district that runs along the street above the Hartsdale train station. ''As one business goes, it takes away some business to me,'' said Munish Kapur, owner of the Big Top, which depends heavily on foot traffic. ''We still don't know how many of the closed businesses will go and how many will stay. That's a concern.'' More than a month after heavy rains flooded many parts of the county, about a half-dozen businesses along the avenue are still closed -- including at least two restaurants, a bagel shop, a bakery, a fitness center and a green market. The two that have completely reopened -- Tip Top and Hartsdale Wine and Liquors -- are watching closely to see if shoppers return. ''I'm a little nervous,'' said Robert Troy, the wine shop owner. Kar C. Kwok, owner of K. Fung's, a Chinese restaurant, said he was unsure how he would come up with the $250,000 to $300,000 needed to make repairs. Water filled the basement of the establishment and reached more than six inches high in the first-floor dining room. Flooring was destroyed, furniture and restaurant equipment was ruined and mold is beginning to grow in the basement. His insurance did not cover the damage. ''I want to stay,'' he said, ''but I have no idea how I will do that.'' Several merchants who had applied for low-interest loans with the Federal Emergency Management Agency have yet to hear back. But it was unlikely a loan would come close to covering his damage, Mr. Kwok said. Other businesses were moving as fast as possible to reopen. But every passing day means another day with no income and the possibility that customers will take their business elsewhere. ''It's pretty devastating for everybody, even those businesses that are open,'' said Craig Cupani, owner of Lia's, an Italian restaurant, which hoped to reopen this week. Mr. Cupani noted that although all the businesses that were flooded are on the same side of the street, businesses on the other side, which have remained open, are also suffering because some customers -- like those who go to the fitness center -- are not coming to the area. The shuttered shops had also hurt strides made in generating business in the area, he said, which has struggled in recent years to compete against large retailers on nearby Central Avenue. To try to draw more people to the area, Paul J. Feiner, the Greenburgh supervisor, has proposed opening a satellite library in a vacant site like the old HSBC building. Many residents and merchants welcome the idea. ''It's one block, but it's an incredibly useful block,'' said Shula Darviche, a marketing consultant who lives in the neighborhood. ''It really adds to the life in this little suburb.'' Beyond retaining customers, merchants are also worried about the need to address the conditions that led to the flooding. Some charge that drainage behind their stores is inadequate and want local officials to address the problem. ''We've got to make sure this doesn't happen again,'' said Mr. Cupani, who along with other merchants, has hired an engineer to examine the issue. ''There's no way anybody is going to recoup from another one of these.'' BUSINESSES"
"The Federal Emergency Management Agency measures disasters in a way that only a statistician could love. It turns out that the agency does not simply assess damage the storm inflicted on, say, each town. It estimates the cost of the damage per capita on the population of each county. If the figure does not reach $3.05 per capita, counties are out of luck in attaining the coveted federal disaster rating that would help pay for damage. This has real significance along the Housatonic River, which experienced flooding this past April not seen in 50 years. The Housatonic marks much of the boundary between New Haven and Fairfield Counties. But because of the peculiar manner in which FEMA assesses damage, Fairfield County was declared eligible for federal disaster aid, but New Haven County was not. That means riverside towns that were all equally flooded will get money only if they are located on the Fairfield County side. So Shelton, in Fairfield County, can apply for federal help while Derby, Oxford and Seymour -- just as hard hit by the raging torrent -- are snubbed because they are in New Haven County. In this case, a system of measuring damage based not on the facts, but only on how they fit into mathematical equations, strikes us as arbitrary. FEMA should rethink its approach and the state should vigorously object, and appeal. Connecticut"
"Miles and miles of bigger and stronger levees have been built along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers since the deadly floods of 1993, and millions of dollars have been spent on drainage improvements. Yet as the rush of water that caused the Missouri River to overflow its banks and submerge dozens of towns last week rolled toward St. Louis on Monday, attention was turned to a metropolitan region that since 1993 has seen runaway residential and commercial development in the rivers' flood paths. About 28,000 homes have been built and more than 6,000 acres of commercial and industrial space developed on land that was underwater in 1993, according to research by Nicholas Pinter, a geologist who studies the region at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. Building is happening on flood plains across Missouri, but most of the development is in the St. Louis area, and it is estimated to be worth more than $2.2 billion. Though scientists warn about the danger of such building, the Missouri government has subsidized some of it through tax financing for builders. ''No one has really looked at the cumulative effect,'' said Timothy M. Kusky, a professor of natural sciences at St. Louis University, who calculates that there has been more development on the Missouri River flood plain in the years since 1993 than at any other time in the history of the region. The good news for St. Louis right now is that forecasters say the two rivers will crest well below their 1993 levels by Tuesday, sparing the area significant flooding. But many scientists remain concerned that the effect of the new construction, should a levee break, could eventually be even more severe flooding. Levees constrict a river's path and raise its water level, which causes higher, faster flow. A flood plain, conversely, exists in nature to absorb a river's overflow. ''The more levees we build, the higher we have to build them,'' Professor Kusky said. ''It's a self-perpetuating problem.'' Still, people have been drawn to the area, assured by the sense of security the levees provide. Disincentives beyond the possibility of flooding seem to be few. ''This was absolutely a dodged bullet,'' Professor Pinter said. ''This could have been a very bad situation for St. Louis, but luckily it was a near-miss.'' People living in the flood plains are eligible for the National Flood Insurance Program or for any private insurance they can secure, though the private alternatives are increasingly difficult to obtain. And they are entitled to whatever federal disaster relief is offered to the state after a flood, be it temporary housing or buyouts, said Butch Kinerney, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. THF Realty Inc. used Missouri's tax program, known as tax increment financing, to build what is said to be the largest strip mall in the country on land in the Chesterfield Valley area of St. Louis County that was submerged in the floods of 1993. The shopping center, which cost $275 million to build, opened in 1999 and now has more than two million square feet of retail space, mall officials said. The developers spent more than $35 million on levee and storm drainage improvements, replacing an old levee that had offered protection against a 100-year flood with a levee that met the standards for a 500-year flood. And, they said, they have brought jobs and revenue to a formerly sleepy part of the county. ''We built the shopping center and interchange that opened the entire valley,'' said Marian Nunn, the chief operating officer of THF Realty. ''The difference is that the levee is maintained now, on top of being bigger, stronger and better. The risks are really substantially mitigated.'' The company was able to use the special financing because Missouri allows it for projects in areas that are considered blighted, or where development is not likely to occur without help. ''We will continue to build even more,'' Ms. Nunn said. Faith in the levees seems to trump other concerns here. ''We're not even close to having any issues,'' said Brian McGownd, the deputy director of public works in Chesterfield. Of the new levee, Mr. McGownd said, ''We have 100 percent confidence that it's done right, and the way it's supposed to be, and that it will be a good, strong levee for many years.'' Fear of flooding did not appear to scare off prospective buyers at the New Town at St. Charles, a housing development whose sales office hummed with activity on Sunday, even as the Missouri River was rising. Although the community is near the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, residents are not required to have flood insurance, because they are beyond the 100-year flood plain. The location was a selling point for Ken Snider, a high school teacher from St. Louis. ''It's not going to flood here for another 100 years,'' Mr. Snider said, ''and I won't be around by then.'' But critics of the developments say someone else is likely to be around then, and taxpayers in general will carry the tab after the next disaster bailout. ''If history tells us anything, it's that levees once built eventually fail,'' Professor Pinter said. ''But instead of being farmland there, now it's a strip mall or residential area, or a whole city.'' The floods of 1993 killed 38 people and caused $16 billion in damage across the Midwest. More than 500 counties were declared federal disaster areas. Adolphus A. Busch IV, a member of the Anheuser-Busch brewing family who helped found the Great Rivers Habitat Alliance in St. Louis in 2000, is alarmed at the pace of development in the rivers' paths after the 1993 flood. ''That was the milestone for us,'' Mr. Busch said. ''At that point the federal government came in and did major buyouts, and people said, 'Look, we've learned our lesson: no more development.' Well, that lasted for about six or seven years.'' He continued, ''We always realized that there would be fringe development, but we never envisioned after 1993 that anyone would try to build major levees and enclose thousands of acres.'' Some people already living in the flood plain at the time of the last big flood now say that it just makes economic sense for them to stay close to the river, and that it is an issue of personal-risk calculation and property rights. Doris Hulst, a 65-year-old school bus driver, is the sole homeowner on a 109-acre swath of land that once housed three trailer parks near the Missouri River in St. Charles County. ''They all took the buyout,'' Mrs. Hulst said of her neighbors who relocated after the flood. ''I took the buyout on a trailer I owned across the street, but you didn't make enough money to buy anything decent.'' Today, Mrs. Hulst's trailer is elevated on three rows of cinder blocks. ''We'll be fine as long as the Mississippi doesn't back up,'' she said. Alan Dooley, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers, St. Louis District, said people, like water, had certain natural inclinations. ''People have a tendency to locate near water,'' Mr. Dooley said. ''These people vote; they pay taxes. It's kind of difficult to go through with a broad brush and say, 'You all ought to get out of here.' ''"
"Four weeks after a northeaster caused extensive flooding in several Westchester communities, homeowners continued to file for federal assistance last week to cope with damages. ''It's beginning to ease up a little bit,'' said Art Alejandre, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is coordinating assistance efforts. However, he said, outreach centers being operated at home improvement centers last week had resulted in an increase in applications for aid. By midweek, there had been more than 5,146 registrations statewide for assistance, more than two-thirds -- 3,507 -- from Westchester. More than $7 million in assistance had been distributed statewide, Mr. Alejandre said, about $5.9 million for housing assistance, most of it in Westchester. He said 19 loans had been approved by the federal Small Business Administration for more than $1 million statewide. He attributed the small number of loans to the fact that many of the applications sent out to businesses seeking assistance had not been returned. He noted that residents who are denied assistance can appeal the decision. Help in resubmitting applications is being offered at three disaster recovery centers, in Mamaroneck, Eastchester and New Rochelle. The last day to sign up to receive aid is June 23, Mr. Alejandre said. Additional outreach is being conducted by FEMA and the State Emergency Management Office at Home Depot stores in two Westchester locations: 601 Sprain Road in Yonkers and 150 Midland Avenue in Port Chester. Today is the last day FEMA outreach workers will be there to answer questions about flood cleanup and how to prepare for future flooding. Fletcher Jackson, a FEMA community outreach representative working at the Home Depot in Yonkers, said about 60 to 100 people a day were stopping at the information table. About half had sustained flood damage in the April 15 storm. ''We want people to be better prepared,'' Mr. Alejandre said. ''The question is not if there will be another event, but when.'' Sewage Danger Is Over In Hudson, Officials Say County health officials on Thursday lifted a warning cautioning people to stay out of the Hudson River, six days after a pipe ruptured in Yonkers, releasing more than 7.5 million gallons of raw sewage into the river. ''We haven't had a spill of this size for half a dozen years,'' said Mary Landrigan, a spokeswoman with the county Health Department. The spill occurred May 4 when a 48-inch concrete pipe broke after a hillside, weakened by heavy rainfall in April, collapsed. The break occurred just north of the Greystone train station, contaminating water from the northern end of the Bronx, through Westchester and into southern Rockland County. Ms. Landrigan said contact with the contaminated water could lead to stomach cramps, vomiting and diarrhea, although no cases had been reported by late last week. The leak was fixed within days, and Ms. Landrigan said tidal action and the large volume of water in the river would disperse the sewage. Drinking water was not affected. However, an additional half million gallons of sewage flowed into a nearby wetland. State environmental officials said they were examining the impact to determine whether a cleanup would be necessary. THE WEEK"
"Torrential overnight rainfall flooded several towns in North Texas on Monday, killing four people and stranding people and their pets on the roofs of their homes awaiting rescue. Creeks swollen by as much as eight inches of rain inundated parts of Gainesville and Sherman, near the Oklahoma state line. A 4-year-old girl, Alexandria Collins, died after she was swept away by rushing water in Haltom City, a Fort Worth suburb. Her body was found more than two hours later. A woman died in Sherman, about 60 miles northwest of Dallas, after her car stalled in rising water and was swept away, said Sgt. Bruce Dawsey of the Sherman police. In Gainesville, a 5-year-old girl and her grandmother were swept to their deaths after the family's mobile home was carried off its foundation and lodged against a bridge above a swollen creek, said Cpl. Mike Linnell of the Texas Department of Public Safety. Aerial video showed dozens of people seeking refuge from the high water on a railroad crossing. Families awaited rescue on their roofs, some having hacked their way to the outside from their attics. Some were joined by their dogs. About 100 mobile homes in Haltom City were inundated, and many were washed off their foundations, emergency officials said. ''When I looked out the window, water was up to the bottom of the window and the current was so fast houses were washing away, said Rachel Hawkes, a Haltom City resident. ''You could hear people screaming, but we couldn't get out to help.'' The National Weather Service said rain fell at a rate of an inch every 15 minutes in some places."
"Torrential rains in southern China have unleashed surging floodwaters that have swept through small cities and farming villages, claiming at least 66 lives, forcing nearly 600,000 people to be relocated and destroying millions of dollars in property, the state news media reported Sunday. Rescue efforts were under way in the southern provinces of Hunan, Guizhou, Guangdong and Guangxi, as the floodwaters swept through mountainous regions prone to landslides. Nearly nine million people were directly affected by the flooding, and factories and other enterprises have been closed in some areas, according to Xinhua, China's official news agency. Heavy rains began last Wednesday in southern China and deluged the region into the weekend. By Sunday, the rains had subsided in Guangxi Province, but more flooding was possible as water levels in local rivers were expected to keep rising for several days. Guangxi had reported eight deaths as well as extensive property damage, including the destruction of more than 3,700 homes and thousands of acres of cropland. Flooding is an annual early summer event in southern China and a reminder of the country's contradictory weather patterns. Even as the south is awash in floodwaters, other regions of China are gripped by record drought. In the southwestern corner of Sichuan Province, drought is so severe that trucks are delivering emergency water supplies. Major cities along the southern coast, including the manufacturing export centers in Guangdong Province, were not reporting any flooding problems. But water was chest high in other parts of the province, including Zi Jin County, where some towns were experiencing the worst flooding in 50 years. In one town, state news media showed a group of men carrying a pregnant woman atop a makeshift barge through waist-deep water. Earlier this year, Chinese experts warned that southern China could experience serious flooding this summer, particularly along the middle and lower sections of the Yangtze River. In spring, there was major drought on the upper reaches of the river, and the experts warned that flooding could follow. China Central Television estimated property damages at 1.5 billion yuan, or about $198 million, for the region."
"As the floodwaters outside rose quickly to more than 10 feet in spots, Sam Arroyo looked out his first- floor window to see the torrent lift his 19-foot fishing boat off its trailer. Mr. Arroyo does not have a waterfront home -- he lives near the Grand Central Parkway, in a two-family house on Ditmars Boulevard in Astoria, Queens, -- but for several hours on Wednesday, his building turned into one. A water main on the boulevard near 70th Street broke, pumping a million gallons of water over several blocks, submerging cars, flooding houses, filling basements to the ceilings and forcing rescue workers to use inflatable rafts. Dozens of people were temporarily evacuated from their homes. Mr. Arroyo's boat was parked on a trailer in an alley behind a row of apartment buildings on Ditmars Boulevard. The 20-inch main broke at 4:20 p.m., when a private contractor was working near it with a backhoe. The break created a flood that submerged three cars in the lot and a van, and left Mr. Arroyo's boat on top of a submerged car parked near his building. Seeing his opportunity, he opened his window, leaped onto the boat and managed to maneuver it so that when the water finally receded about two hours later, it was lowered gently back onto its trailer. Mr. Arroyo's home, and the houses of dozens of his neighbors, did not fare so well. Although there were no injuries, many homes along Ditmars Boulevard suffered severe damage. Scott Ryan, 37, a real estate agent who owns a building on Ditmars, said that a basement apartment he recently spent $50,000 to renovate was flooded to the ceiling after the water ripped the back door open and toppled a new refrigerator and clothes dryer. ''My insurance company told me, 'You're not covered for flooding,''' he said. ''All my neighbors have been denied, not just me. I figured I'm not in a flood zone, so there's no reason to have flood insurance. The city hasn't stepped up either, and the contractor got a lawyer immediately. If this was an act of God or an act of nature, I could understand. But it wasn't nature digging up a water main on Ditmars Boulevard on Wednesday.'' A neighbor, Emilio Rodriguez, 71, said his basement was filled with water, which upended a dresser, a couch and a television set and soaked other belongings, including family photographs dating to the 1940's. Steve and Stacy Vourderis surveyed the damage to the large basement of their home on the boulevard. Mr. Vourderis, 42, who said his family owns the Wonder Wheel at Coney Island, estimated his home had $200,000 in damage. The water also flooded another house he owns across the street, he said, and submerged and ruined the 1980 Trans Am he recently bequeathed to his son. He looked at his collections of records and wine strewn about the basement floor, as well as his purple stereo console and amplifiers used in his side business as a party D.J. The water lifted his pool table off the floor and toppled it. Mrs. Vourderis, 42, lamented the loss of family mementos: the ruined heirloom wedding dresses, antique dressers and their three children's belongings. ''It's a lifetime of possessions ruined,'' she said. ''The water just kept pouring in like Niagara Falls.'' Charles G. Sturcken, a spokesman for the city's Department of Environmental Protection, said an investigation would determine whether the contractor caused the break, and added, ''We're doing everything we can to get everything back to normal.''"
"I have this week's front pages arrayed on the desk around me. There's a picture of dead children lined up on a floor while a mother wails. There's a picture of a man on the beach holding his dead son's hand to his forehead. There are others, each as wrenching as the last. Human beings have always told stories to explain deluges such as this. Most cultures have deep at their core a flood myth in which the great bulk of humanity is destroyed and a few are left to repopulate and repurify the human race. In most of these stories, God is meting out retribution, punishing those who have strayed from his path. The flood starts a new history, which will be on a higher plane than the old. Nowadays we find these kinds of explanations repugnant. It is repugnant to imply that the people who suffer from natural disasters somehow deserve their fate. And yet for all the callousness of those tales, they did at least put human beings at the center of history. In those old flood myths, things happened because human beings behaved in certain ways; their morality was tied to their destiny. Stories of a wrathful God implied that at least there was an active God, who had some plan for the human race. At the end of the tribulations there would be salvation. If you listen to the discussion of the tsunami this past week, you receive the clear impression that the meaning of this event is that there is no meaning. Humans are not the universe's main concern. We're just gnats on the crust of the earth. The earth shrugs and 140,000 gnats die, victims of forces far larger and more permanent than themselves. Most of the stories that were told and repeated this week were melodramas. One person freakishly survives while another perishes, and there is really no cause for one's good fortune or the other's bad. A baby survives by sitting on a mattress. Others are washed out to sea and then wash back bloated and dead. There is no human agency in these stories, just nature's awful lottery. The nature we saw this week is different from the nature we tell ourselves about in the natural history museum, at the organic grocery store and on a weekend outing to the national park. This week nature seems amoral and viciously cruel. This week we're reminded that the word ''wilderness'' derives from the word for willful and uncontrollable. This catastrophic, genocidal nature is a long way from the benign and rhythmic circle of life in ''The Lion King.'' It's a long way from the naturalist theology of Thoreau's ''Walden'' or the writings of John Muir. The naturalists hold up nature as the spiritual tonic to our vulgar modern world. They urge us to break down the barriers that alienate us from nature. Live simply and imbibe nature's wisdom. ''Probably if our lives were more conformed to nature, we should not need to defend ourselves against her heats and colds, but find her our constant nurse and friend, as do plants and quadrupeds,'' Thoreau wrote. Nature doesn't seem much like a nurse or friend this week, and when Thoreau goes on to celebrate the savage wildness of nature, he sounds, this week, like a boy who has seen a war movie and thinks he has experienced the glory of combat. In short, this week images of something dark and unmerciful were thrust onto a culture that is by temperament upbeat and romantic. In the newspaper essays and television commentaries reflecting upon it all, there would often be some awkward passage as the author tried to conclude with some easy uplift -- a little bromide about how wonderfully we all rallied together, and how we are all connected by our common humanity in times of crisis. The world's generosity has indeed been amazing, but sometimes we use our compassion as a self-enveloping fog to obscure our view of the abyss. Somehow it's wrong to turn this event into a good-news story so we can all feel warm this holiday season. It's wrong to turn it into a story about us, who gave, rather than about them, whose lives were ruined. It's certainly wrong to turn this into yet another petty political spat, as many tried, disgustingly, to do. This is a moment to feel deeply bad, for the dead and for those of us who have no explanation. Nicholas D. Kristof is on vacation. Op-Ed Columnist E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com"
"Ernie Garcia, 78, who has lived here in the shadow of an unstable sea cliff since 1988, ignored warnings to evacuate before Monday's fatal mudslide and has refused to leave ever since. ''The house holds memories,'' he said as he wandered along the highway near his home, which was spared, in La Conchita on Thursday afternoon. ''After a while, time cures everything, even death.'' Despite his and some other residents' determination to remain and rebuild in La Conchita, which has had two major mudslides in the past 10 years, they may not be allowed to do so. Some independent geologists say the 500-foot-high cliffs looming over the town are part of an extremely unstable geological formation and that further slides, perhaps even more devastating, are inevitable. One geologist suggested that the houses be razed and the area turned into a park. Evidence of the danger came again on Thursday morning when the giant mud pile that engulfed part of the town shifted six feet, forcing a halt to most rescue work. The death toll remained at 10, and with rescue workers increasingly confident that they have located all the people who were thought to be buried in the muck, the rescue efforts turned to a cleanup effort. The continuing danger meant that residents were being encouraged to keep out for the foreseeable future, although they were being allowed in briefly to pick up belongings. ''Rain is not the only factor,'' Sheriff Bob Brooks of Ventura County said. ''Rain or shine, there's a danger of landslides. You could lose the rest of the community.'' County officials said they would conduct a study to determine whether anything could be done at a reasonable cost to taxpayers to make the town safe. The alternative would be to condemn the entire 160-home hamlet and force the residents to move elsewhere. The return of residents to areas of danger is a story told over and over in California. Hundreds of thousands of Californians make their homes in canyons, on hillsides, on floodplains and along the coast, areas subject to floods, landslides and wildfires. Much of the state sits atop a network of earthquake faults, so all Californians live with a sense of fatalism. La Conchita is a microcosm of California's flirtation with natural disaster, a place where residents trade the sunsets, the sound of the surf and the beauty of the steep cliffs for the chance of a sudden and violent death. Some, like Mr. Garcia, would rather stay and face fate. He said he had paid about $100,000 for his land and the two-story Mediterranean-style house he built on it 15 years ago. He said he thought his house was worth close to $1 million before Monday's disaster. He would not even guess what it is worth now. Others, like Jamon Peariso, have seen enough. ''I've got a 5-month-old boy,'' Mr. Peariso, 29, said as he dragged a suitcase and a backpack away from his rented house, which was not damaged. ''Forget it, I'm leaving. It's too dangerous. I'm just going to find a new place.'' With all those in the town on Monday thought to be accounted for, the authorities ended rescue efforts on Thursday afternoon. ''The last person brought out alive was 56 hours ago,'' Bob Roper, the Ventura County fire chief, said. ''We are now moving this operation from a rescue operation to a re-establishment of the community.'' Steve Bennett, the Ventura County supervisor for the area including La Conchita, said the collapse was so sudden and cataclysmic that no warning system could have alerted residents in time to evacuate. He said that if geologic and engineering studies determined that there was no feasible way to prevent future shifts, the government would have to find a way to compensate and relocate the 250 or so residents, raising tough financial and legal questions. If, however, studies show that a terracing system or retaining walls can control the forces of gravity and geology, it becomes a question of cost, and who pays. The new landslide obliterated a $400,000 retaining wall built after the 1995 slide. ''It gets pretty complicated and messy,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''It becomes an interesting interaction between public safety and private property laws. ''We've left this as a gray area in America. When is it the taxpayers' responsibility, and when is it the private citizen's? People say they have the right to live wherever they want, but do they have the right to have the taxpayers fund it?'' There is precedent for government stepping in after a disaster, buying up the property and moving the residents out. The most celebrated example is Valmeyer, Ill., a town along the Mississippi River about 25 miles from St. Louis that was virtually wiped out by two floods in succession in 1993. With help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the town relocated to higher ground over the next three years, rebuilding schools, businesses and homes. After the Midwest flooding of 1993, FEMA bought 10,000 properties in flood-prone areas and helped families and businesses start over. An official said at the time that the program was cheaper than to continue building dams, levees, roads and bridges and to compensate property owners for their losses. Nothing on this scale has ever been done in California, and it was unclear whether state or local officials would have the stomach or the legal authority to relocate La Conchita families. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger visited the village on Wednesday and encouraged the residents to return and rebuild their lives. On Thursday, his spokeswoman, Margita Thompson, said the governor did not intend to say that the state had decided the area was safe. ''He was offering words of encouragement and support,'' she said, not making a policy statement. Edward Keller, a professor of geology and environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said the La Conchita mudslides of 1995 and 2005 were a single geologic event and a warning of further activity in the area. The ground underneath that part of the California coast rises at a rate of about 15 feet every 1,000 years, one of the fastest such tectonic shifts in the world. Periodic heavy rainfall and the constant shifting of the ground underneath make the cliffs extremely unstable, Professor Keller said. ''This is going to move for hundreds of years with dozens of events like that,'' he said. Professor Keller said that building a retaining wall to hold back the mountain, even if it were technically possible, would almost certainly cost more than the value of the entire town. Better to level it and turn it into a seaside park, he suggested. ''I think it's the responsible thing to do,'' he said. ''There are just some places we shouldn't build.'' Ted and Diane Jennings, a couple in their mid-50's who have lived in La Conchita for the past 12 years, said that they knew the hillside was a threat, but that the beauty of the area outweighed the danger. Mr. Jennings said many residents thought the government was going to condemn the town and force them out. He said he planned to stay in his house, which was not damaged, and fight. ''Look around, it's absolutely beautiful,'' he said. In the more than 4,000 days they had lived there, there had only been two bad ones, referring to the mudslides of 1995 and this week. ''I'd rather live here and die in my house,'' he added."
"RICHARD GREEN carries flood insurance, but like his neighbors on Lambert Lane in Lambertville, N.J., who are cleaning up from the third worst flooding by the Delaware River in a century, he faces the daunting task of reclaiming his house and recreating his home. ''I'll have to find someone to power wash all of the rooms, then dry vacuum, then bring in big blowers and dehumidifiers, and then there has to be an ozone treatment to get the mold out,'' said Mr. Green, who lives in a row of contemporary town houses. He said he has no idea how much his insurance will pay or how much he has lost. As the waters of the region's swollen rivers recede, homeowners like Mr. Green are assessing the damage, reckoning with the loss of treasured personal items and dealing with the pervasive smell of damp. And for those who have experienced floods before, a major question looms: Stay put or sell and seek safer ground? Even before torrential rains hit the region over the weekend, Kim Cosack, a real estate agent with Prudential Fox & Roach in Newtown, Pa., said she fielded calls from three worried owners in Yardley, partly sandwiched between the Delaware River and the Delaware and Raritan Canal, wondering if they should sell. ''I said yes,'' said Ms. Cosack, who noted that many houses in Yardley and nearby New Hope remained empty seven months after the last flood sent residents fleeing. Before the September deluge, a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house in the flood zones of Yardley or New Hope was selling for a little over $300,000; now those properties would fetch closer to $260,000, she said. Other real estate agents are more sanguine. In Sidney, N.Y., near Deposit, where two men driving a van were swept into a creek that feeds into the Delaware, Rich Marcello, a real estate agent with DeMulder Realty USA, said most homeowners there were likely to call their insurance companies and sit tight. ''A lot of the folks in this particular area are hardy people,'' Mr. Marcello said. ''We roll up our sleeves, and when the water recedes, we go back to life as usual, so I don't think it's going to affect pricing.'' What's more, brisk demand for country homes has driven prices up by 20 percent a year since 2001, he added, with three-bedroom houses typically selling for $90,000 to $125,000. For Ed Padilla, chairman of the Goss press manufacturing company, and his wife, Suzanne, the question of moving from their town house in Lambertville, which sits on the Delaware across from New Hope, never comes up. ''We have this ever-changing view of the river when the river is calm,'' he said from his first-floor deck overlooking the river, ''and then we have to deal with this mess when the river is angry. And last weekend it was angry.'' Mr. Padilla was able to rescue much of the furniture from his ground-floor den, but the antique mechanical orchestrion, with seven mechanical instruments worth tens of thousands of dollars, was too heavy for him to move and was damaged. Cleanup: Hire a Pro? Homeowners face a costly cleanup, whether they do it themselves or hire experts, some of whom use heavy equipment and high-tech gadgets like a thermal imaging camera, which detects moisture behind walls. Officials at Servpro Industries, one of the largest firms in the cleanup and restoration field, said cleaning after a flood can cost clients $500 to $3,000. Do-it-yourselfers can rent fans and dehumidifiers from stores like Home Depot for $30 to $60 a day, said Jack Oliver, president of Servpro of Northern Sussex and Wayne, a flood-hit region in northwest New Jersey. Mr. Oliver pointed out that it is hard for amateurs to master the equipment, ''and they don't know the science of drying.'' In one of the most difficult jobs he said he faced this week -- a house with more than three feet of standing water in the basement -- he sent in six men, a truck-mounted water extractor and commercial-grade fans and dehumidifiers. The cost to the owner will be $4,000 to $5,000 for water extraction and drying, usually covered by flood insurance,he said. Drying out a flooded house is a race against the clock. Within 72 hours ''you run the risk of mold growth, and that can lead to wet rot structural damage,'' said Mr. Oliver, who is handling about 15 houses in Sussex County and the northern part of Passaic County. While several experts agreed that most flooded houses can be saved if attended to quickly, do-it-yourselfers should plan to use 4 or 5 dehumidifiers and up to 10 high-velocity fans -- assuming they're available -- to eliminate water and dampness thoroughly. Thermal imaging devices cost $10,000 or more, ''and they don't rent them at Home Depot,'' said Eric Keith, an owner of K2 Environmental, a Santa Rosa, Calif., company specializing in water-damage repairs. Couples like Tara Reading, an office worker, and BJ Ashton, a firefighter in Lambertville, are worried about the cost of repairing the house they rent from Mr. Ashton's parents. It is an old frame house that sits in a dip on South Union Street in Lambertville, which runs parallel to the Delaware. ''We are doing most of the cleaning ourselves, but we have to find someone to fix the electric and make sure everything is running,'' Ms. Reading said. ''We need new carpeting, flooring, linoleum in the kitchen, and I haven't even opened the counter drawers yet.'' After the September flood, the couple received $3,000 from their insurance company to cover losses, plus $3,200 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (www.fema.org). If the same amount comes through again, they expect to pay an additional $3,000 out of their own pockets to cover damage. The Role of Insurance Flood insurance usually covers many cleanup costs. Homeowners in federally designated flood plains can buy insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program, which is administered by FEMA (now part of the Homeland Security Department). And homeowners with government-backed mortgages like Fannie Mae or Federal Housing Administration loans are legally required to purchase such insurance, which is underwritten by the federal government. Many private mortgage lenders also require that homeowners who live in flood plains purchase such insurance. Buyers can insure a single-family home for up to $250,000 in damage to the property, and can buy additional coverage for home contents like furniture and clothes for up to $100,000 in value. They should expect to pay an average annual premium of about $625 on $100,000 of property coverage, not including a basement, according to the Insurance Information Institute, a trade association. Add a basement and the same coverage rises to about $720 a year. To purchase $5,000 worth of contents coverage, homeowners would pay about $48 a year, said Loretta Worters, a vice president at the institute. For those in unusually high-risk areas, a small group of private insurers offers supplemental flood coverage that will exceed the national flood insurance limits. The Chubb Group of Insurance Companies, for example, will insure a home up to its full replacement value. In places like New Jersey and other parts of the Northeast, as well as Florida, where home values often exceed the insurance coverage provided by the national program, insurance agents recommend that homeowners buy additional coverage. Not everyone needs insurance up to the full replacement value of a home. Residents who live close to rivers are likely to sustain mostly cosmetic damage, said Mark Schussel, a Chubb spokesman, and may not need to replace a house after a flood. But for those who reside near the coasts and are at risk from storm surges during hurricanes, full coverage may be necessary to cover the possibility of extensive structural damage, Mr. Schussel said. Premium rates on a house can range from 8 cents per $100 of valuation to $1.89 per $100 of valuation, he said. Finally, Prevention Besides loading up on insurance, homeowners ''should do their homework, be prepared and have a plan in place,'' said Leslie Chapman-Henderson, chief executive of the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes, a nonprofit organization in Tallahassee, Fla., backed by government grants and foundations, which promotes disaster safety and education (www.flash.org). Have a cleanup kit with gloves, masks, bleach, buckets and a water vacuum at the ready, she said, and place valuables and personal mementos in a high and dry place or a watertight safe. Ms. Chapman-Henderson, for example, stores her wedding album in a large Ziploc bag in her family room, which is near the back door of her house in Tallahassee, an area prone to hurricane flooding . ''I've worked with too many people in disaster areas who have come away with nothing,'' she said, describing her safety and exit strategy. ''That hurts the most.'' John Moran, a vice president at the Lexington Insurance Company, a member company of the American International Group, said there was an uptick in people calling to inquire about flood insurance policies in Florida after the hurricanes; in California after the recent rain storms; and in New Jersey and the Northeast over the last six months. Some experts recommend preventive measures, like installing flood vents, ensuring that roofs are properly sealed and that windows are caulked. But Mr. Oliver, the water-damage specialist, says prevention can go only so far in protecting homes from Mother Nature. Sometimes the power of water can be so awesome, he said, ''there's little anyone can do other than move.'' Correction: April 21, 2005, Thursday An article on April 7 about flood damage misstated the location of some houses in Yardley, Pa. They are between the Delaware River and the Delaware Canal, not between the river and the Delaware and Raritan Canal."
"The flooding caused by heavy weekend rains continued to cause havoc across the region on Monday, forcing the evacuation of several thousand people, closing roads, shutting down businesses and killing at least three people in upstate New York when cars they were in were swept away. The coffee-with-cream-colored Delaware River topped its banks along parts of its length from Port Jervis, N.Y., to New Jersey's state capital here, where the river crested 25.5 feet, almost six feet above the point at which it floods, at 4:30 p.m. That made Monday's flood the third worst along the Delaware in 100 years, after a 30.3-foot crest here in March 1904, and the 28.5-feet crest in August 1955, following Hurricanes Connie and Diane. Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey of New Jersey gave state workers in downtown offices a warm and sunny day off and declared an emergency for New Jersey's Delaware River counties, saying he would apply for federal disaster relief money to help people rebuild. Governor Codey and Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania suspended toll collections on four Delaware River bridges on Monday evening to speed the homeward commute of motorists facing closed streets and detours because of the high water. Many residents and business owners along the Delaware had just finished rebuilding and remodeling from the river's flooding last September. This time, the runoff from the weekend's heavy rains and from the melting snowfall in the northern mountains sent the river over its banks and into basements and first floors once again. At least two-thirds of the 3,500 evacuees in New Jersey live along the Delaware, with the rest in the Passaic River basin in the northeast part of the state, according to state officials. ''There's not much we can do here but sit and drink and talk to the insurance company, and wait for the water to go down,'' said Theresa Rubio, one of the owners of Mother's Restaurant in New Hope, Pa., which flooded for the second time in six months. In New York, the police spent Monday searching for two men whose van was swept into a creek with them inside in Deposit, in Delaware County, on Sunday. Their names have not been released. In Wawarsing, in Ulster County, a car carrying two women was also swept away by a surge of water on the road they were driving on Sunday night. The passenger escaped, but on Monday the Ulster County police found the body of the driver, identified as Maria D. Fuentes, 58, of Ellenville, N.Y. Most of the worst flooding in the eastern part of New York State occurred late Sunday night. About 800 people were evacuated in Port Jervis before the Delaware River crested in that area. Counties in the western upstate region, meanwhile, dug themselves out of a snowstorm that dumped as much as 26 inches in some areas. If there was a consolation to flood victims along the southern reaches of the Delaware, it was that they received ample warning that flooding was likely. Parts of New Jersey have received as much as seven inches of rain in the last month. ''While people were more prepared, it is going to be emotional for them when they come back and see the loss and devastation that the flood created,'' said Cynthia L. Ege, a member of the Lambertville City Council. On Ferry Street in Lambertville, in Hunterdon County, Patrick Monaghan sat on his basement steps Sunday afternoon and watched the Delaware back up into the little creek in his backyard. He had guessed -- wrongly -- that the new kitchen appliances he bought to replace those lost in the September flood would be safe on six-inch-high blocks. But when the water reached his house, he managed to get the appliances and his new cabinets out of the basement kitchen and off to higher ground before the river poured in. Governor Codey said he would request more than the $30 million in emergency management funds that New Jersey received from Washington after the September floods. Because of ample warning of the rising waters, he said, only one family has moved into a shelter, with the rest staying at the homes of friends or finding other accommodations. In Trenton, Mayor Douglas H. Palmer reported that about 1,500 people were forced from 330 homes along the Delaware in the city. He said it could be a week before the flooded homes were inspected for safety, and gas and electric service could be turned back on. The flooding on the Delaware was of a severity that could be expected, statistically, once every 100 years, said John H. Moyle, manager of flood control and dam safety programs for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. In the northern part of the state, the Passaic, the Ramapo and the Pompton Rivers also flooded to lesser degrees, but still severely enough to distress stranded homeowners like Toufic and Samar Katerji, who could only see their Fayette Avenue home in Wayne from a safe distance as the Pompton River swirled around it. ''It's terrible,'' Ms. Katerji said. ''We didn't know this was a flood area.'' The family had fled in their car as the waters rose, but with few possessions. ''My kids want their clothes,'' she said. ''And my son, he's going crazy without his Xbox.'' Ben Amos, a neighbor, just moved to Fayette Avenue in Wayne a month ago. ''I guess we're moving again,'' he said. Correction: April 7, 2005, Thursday A map on Tuesday with an article about flooding along the Delaware River showed incorrect locations for Lambertville, N.J., and New Hope, Pa. They are south of Stockton, N.J., not north."
"Some 2,000 residents of Taunton, Mass., were unable to return to their homes on Tuesday because of fears that a deteriorating dam on a rain-swollen river could rupture and flood the city's downtown area. The residents were evacuated on Monday from a section of Taunton, a city of 50,000 about 40 miles south of Boston. On Tuesday, city and state officials canceled school and closed some roads as they warily watched the 173-year-old wooden dam on Whittenton Pond. Battered by weekend storms that dumped more than seven inches of rain on Taunton, the 12-foot-high dam had lost some of its timbers and was leaking water ''out of places it shouldn't be going,'' said Peter Judge, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. ''The best-case scenario is nothing happens,'' Mr. Judge said. ''The worst-case scenario is it goes any minute.'' The authorities spent Tuesday tracking the Mill River, which is held back by the Whittenton Pond Dam about half a mile upstream from the center of Taunton. If the dam ruptures, it could cause a six-foot wall of water to descend on downtown. Although there are about 3,000 dams in Massachusetts, and some have ruptured over the years, ''no one with any institutional knowledge can remember dealing with a dam situation that would impact a populated area,'' Mr. Judge said. By Tuesday afternoon, engineers had opened the dam's floodgates and were trying to keep water in connecting ponds from flowing into the Mill River. Officials said that the water level in the lake above the dam had receded somewhat, but that the level at the dam had remained constant. Mayor Robert Nunes of Taunton said at a news conference that a wooden support beam at the bottom of the dam had been damaged beyond repair and that the flow of water through the dam was causing vibrations that worried engineers. He said it was unsafe to try to fix the dam with the water level so high. Also on Tuesday, Gov. Mitt Romney ordered the immediate inspection of 186 of the state's ''high hazard'' dams, whose failure could cause significant damage to people or property. There are 320 such dams in the state, but 134 are in good condition, Mr. Romney said. ''My immediate concern is that we focus our available resources on inspecting and reinspecting dams that are under extreme stress due to last week's heavy rains,'' he said. Whittenton Pond Dam, like most others in the state, is privately owned. It received a rating of ''fair'' when it was inspected two years ago, Mr. Romney said, and work has been done on it since then. In Taunton, about two dozen National Guard members with high-water vehicles were standing by, and on Tuesday afternoon, police officers and firefighters knocked on doors downtown to make sure residents had left. Most of them had evacuated and were staying with family and friends. About 60 people, many of them elderly, were at a shelter at Taunton High School. ''It's very scary that something like this could happen,'' said Jeanne Hebert, a lifelong Taunton resident who lives about a half-mile from the river but did not evacuate because her home is on higher ground. ''You start wondering, especially with all natural disasters going on, what's going on with this world.''"
"Gail Lino had barely finished renovating her flood-damaged house alongside the Ramapo River in northern New Jersey when the police rolled down her street with bullhorns on Saturday afternoon, warning residents, as they did last April, to secure their belongings and flee the rising floodwaters. Evacuating during bad weather has become almost a ritual for Mrs. Lino and her neighbors in Oakland Borough, a small community of about 14,000 in Bergen County, about 30 miles northwest of New York City. In April, Mrs. Lino, 45, nearly lost the entire ground floor of her three-story home when heavy rains overwhelmed a dam and flooded dozens of houses. And yesterday, with the dam still scheduled for repair and a major downpour battering the Northeast, Mrs. Lino was forced to abandon her home again. This time, she left fearing that thousands of dollars in new carpet, insulation and oak cabinets would be ruined. ''I'm sick of this,'' Mrs. Lino said yesterday afternoon as she rowed away from her home in an orange canoe with her Siberian husky, Shelby. ''I just finished cleaning up from the first one. I can't believe I have to do this again.'' Mrs. Lino was just one of hundreds of people in Bergen County who evacuated their homes yesterday, the third day of steady rains that swept through the region and flooded many areas. Some of the worst-hit areas were in northern New Jersey, where 8 to 10 inches of rain fell from Friday evening to yesterday afternoon. In Oakland, where floodwaters reached as high as eight feet, 115 homes had be evacuated, said Robert Haemmerle, the borough's police captain. No injuries were reported. As of last night, at least two people were reported to be missing as a result of the rainstorms. A boy and his mother's fiancé were swept away yesterday morning in a flooded river in Hoosick Falls, N.Y., northeast of Albany near the Vermont border, The Associated Press reported. A search continued last night. Many of the areas surrounding Oakland were deluged as well. Yesterday afternoon, the National Weather Service reported that parts of Orange County, N.Y., north of Oakland, had received as much as 12 inches of rain. The rainiest hour of the weekend, according to the weather service, was on Saturday between 10 and 11 p.m., when almost a full inch was recorded in Central Park. Although the widespread rainfall had largely left the metropolitan area and headed north toward Maine by yesterday afternoon, meteorologists predicted that rain would return tomorrow evening and continue through the week, bringing the possibility of more flooding. ''It probably won't be of the caliber of rainfall that we just had, but more rain is on the way,'' said John Gresiak, a senior forecaster with AccuWeather. ''This may be one week where we just don't see any sunshine at all. If we do, we will be extremely lucky.'' The wet weekend was a sharp contrast to the unusually dry September. After only 0.48 of an inch of rain at Central Park last month, the driest September at the park since 1914, the 4.26 inches on Saturday alone managed to top the 3.85 inches that are typical for the entire month of October, said Stephen Fybish, an amateur meteorologist in Manhattan who has tracked New York's weather for decades. ''I was out in the middle of it, and it felt like a near hurricane,'' Mr. Fybish said. Meanwhile, residents of Oakland, many of whom had still not been allowed to return to their homes last night, said they were bracing for the return of rain later this week. Dan McDonnell, 24, whose home was drenched by a wall of water that burst through his basement door late Saturday night, said he had moved most of his valuables to the top floors of his home before he fled yesterday afternoon, anticipating the worst. ''We pretty much know that if there's going to be a flood anywhere,'' he said, ''there's going to be a flood here.''"
"FROM Jakarta to the coast of Louisiana, floodwaters are a growing concern. This is especially true in delta regions, where river and sea combine, as they do in many of the world's great cities, to create a double hazard. No place is more concerned with this problem than the Netherlands, literally ''the lowlands,'' where for centuries people have lived on the edge of water-borne disaster. About a quarter of the country is land reclaimed from the sea, while half of it lies at or below sea level. The country's vulnerability to rising water levels, commonly ascribed to climate change, was on full display last summer at the Rotterdam Architecture Biennale, titled ''The Flood,'' which contained proposals for a floating soccer stadium and housing built on spongelike synthetic riverbanks capable of absorbing flood waters. ''Since World War II, the Dutch have relied on technology for protection from the rivers and the sea,'' said Adriaan Geuze, a landscape architect and the chief curator of the biennale. ''We are convinced that this is not a clever way to deal with reality, and three months after the exhibition closed, Katrina showed us the truth of that.'' For the Dutch, as for everyone else, there appear to be no simple solutions, only costly ones, like abandoning vulnerable terrain. For the first time in its long history, the Netherlands has begun to strategically uncreate itself; last year the government, at the start of a 15-year program, began buying up land and reserving it as flood plain, mostly along river banks. The Dutch are also exploring a solution as old as the first flood: floating architecture. The notion is still in its early stages, with only a handful of houses built and a few developments under way, but it has already attracted the attention of leading Dutch designers and some developers. If it proves sufficiently functional, affordable and attractive, floating architecture could find its way to many of the world's flood zones. In the town of Aalsmeer, in the southwest, an area badly damaged by floods in 1953, Sjef Snel and his wife, Agnes, moved into their floating house a little more than a year ago. ''It took me over six months to settle down,'' Mr. Snel said, ''and then I knew I was at the right place.'' Even better, Mr. Snel, 45, says he has no more concerns about flooding. ''I feel totally safe,'' he said. ''Our living room is eight inches above water and the house is mobile. There is certainly no reason to be fearful.'' The house was designed by Agnes Snel in collaboration with Koen Olthuis, a 34-year-old Dutch architect who has emerged as a leading advocate for floating buildings. His small practice, called Waterstudio, is devoted exclusively to such projects. ''Most of these projects are in the first phase,'' Mr. Olthuis said from his offices in Rijswijk, ''since using water, not just defending against it, is a new idea.'' Dura Vermeer, one of the country's largest builders, is also experimenting with floating structures. It has created a community of 48 amphibious homes in Maasbommel, on the banks of the Maas river. The brightly colored 700-square-foot homes, designed by Factor Architecten, a large design firm based in Amsterdam, are set in what was once a parking area for recreational vehicles. ''These are not houseboats,'' said Ger Kengen of Factor. ''You have to design everything as if it were on the ground, only 10 feet up in the air.'' Anna van der Molen, 45, who lives with her husband and child in one of the houses, said ''not only do we live on water, but we also live with water.'' The houses sit on concrete pontoons that rest on footings projected slightly above the river bottom at low water periods, but ride up during floods along a pair of 15-foot poles. Their low center of gravity, created by the weight of the pontoons, makes them very stable. Still, Ms. van der Molen said, ''Sometimes it is scary, very scary, when the water is coming up.'' Chris Zevenbergen, the director for business development of Dura Vermeer, said, ''We decided five years ago to take water as one of our strategic objectives. The company is also designing a ''floating city,'' for 12,000 people near Schiphol Airport, not far from Amsterdam, in the fastest growing area of the country. The design will cost more than $1.2 million, 45 percent of which will be paid for by the government. The goal is a town that can live with flooding, not just wall it off, using a variety of floating structures and an extensive system for rainwater storage, among other means. The challenge is aesthetic as well as commercial, notes Herman Hertzberger, who at 73 is regarded by many as the grand old man of Dutch architecture. No one yet knows what waterborne housing should look like, he said, or how it should function. Mr. Hertzberger offered some possibilities several years ago in the design of an amphibious house that revolves on a base of massive steel pontoons, turning the house, ''toward the sun or away from a neighbor,'' he said. The house is in Middelburg, the capital of Zeeland, the area hardest hit by the 1953 flood, which killed more than 1,800 people. The prototype, now owned by Don Monfils, an architect, and his wife, Lidia Filius, brought a commission from a Dutch builder to create two clusters of floating houses, each set on long concrete foundations, in the same area. There will be about 20 houses in all, Mr. Hertzberger said. But it remains to be seen how waterborne homes, as a form, will evolve. ''The problem I have is that I have not seen any great examples of contemporary floating architecture,'' said Aaron Betsky, director of the Netherlands Architecture Institute in Rotterdam. ''What makes a floating house different than a houseboat?'' Giving land back to the river and the sea is a solution that will create its own problems. The Netherlands is small and among the world's most densely populated countries, so the lands set aside for water must be put to productive use. Bart Mispelblom Beyer, a principal with Tangram, a well-known Dutch architectural office, said his firm has designed 85 houses for a tidal zone near the southern city of Dordrecht. The buildings, which will rise and fall with the tide, are being built on tidal lands because that was the only site for new homes the developer could find. A few months ago, the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment announced that it was accepting proposals to develop amphibious and other types of flood-resilient structures in 15 flood-prone areas. These are places, like the plains between rivers and the dikes that hold back their waters, in which the Dutch have never permitted construction. Some architects remain skeptical about the large-scale feasibility of floating homes. Art Zaaijer designed six houses for a lakeside development at IJburg, outside Amsterdam. They are amphibious, and since they sit in a nature preserve, are designed to be nonpolluting. Unfortunately, Mr. Zaaijer said, development has been stalled by an economic slowdown, and his houses, he said with a mixture of amusement and chagrin, have been occupied by squatters. ''There are squatters from all over the world there,'' he said, ''totally happy, living in exceptional houses with wonderful views. Last time I went by I met a group of Brazilian painters.'' Mr. Zaaijer clearly loves these homes, but he is skeptical about the contribution such structures will make. ''We have six or seven million houses in Holland,'' he said, ''and this will always be a marginal addition to them.'' Mr. Betsky is not quite so pessimistic, but he acknowledges significant obstacles. ''In most of the designs I've seen,'' he said, ''the houses are isolated objects connected to the shore by a thin umbilical cord.'' ''A luxurious isolation tank seems to be the destiny of many Dutch lakes and rivers,'' he added. ''Might there be a community like what one finds in Southeast Asia, where the houses connect to each other as well? I am still looking for good examples.'' DESIGN NOTEBOOK"
"Hundreds of residents were evacuated yesterday from their homes in New Jersey, from Bergen County to the southern tip of the state, as a slow-moving storm camped out over the region for an eighth day, flooding rivers, closing roads, destroying beaches and prompting Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey to declare a state of emergency. Rain also continued to drench the rest of the metropolitan region. As of 8 p.m., 13.25 inches of rain had fallen this month in Central Park, making some meteorologists call it the wettest October since record-keeping began in 1869. In some parts of central Long Island, more than a foot of rain has fallen since Tuesday. And yesterday's downpours took a serious toll as park officials expressed alarm that unusually severe flooding had caused erosion at beaches all over the island -- along the South Shore, the shorelines of interior bays and the North Shore bluffs overlooking Long Island Sound. ''It's been almost hurricane-like effects,'' said a deputy parks commissioner in Suffolk County, Tracey Bellone. ''Even our golf courses are under water everywhere.'' In Orange County, N.Y., where more than seven inches of rain has fallen in some areas over the past two days, parts of 16 state, county and local roads remained closed because of flooding, down from 30 earlier in the week. In Washingtonville, in eastern Orange County, about 20 houses were flooded, mostly in the basements, after the Moodna Creek went over its banks, said Dominick Greene, deputy commissioner of the county's Department of Emergency Services. Three families that asked to be evacuated were put up in local hotels by the Red Cross. But it was New Jersey that took the brunt of the rain, nearly from end to end. In Spring Lake, a seaside town in Monmouth County, the police began their day with a mandatory evacuation of about 350 houses near the borough's southern tip after a dam broke and Wreck Pond overflowed. More than 300 people were carried out of the area in boats and four-wheel-drive vehicles, the police said, and many left in a rush. ''They rowed the rowboat right to my door,'' said Joyce Schnering, who grabbed her cellphone charger on the way out while forgetting the phone. ''The water was starting to come in the front porch.'' Several other seaside towns were also affected by the rising rivers and high tides. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection reported severe erosion on all Atlantic beaches north of Cape May County, and flooding at the Shark River inlet in Belmar and Deal Lake in Loch Arbour sent waist-deep water onto major roadways. Near the Shark River, about 50 people were evacuated from a five-block area in Belmar, and 50 more were advised to leave their homes in nearby Neptune, said Neal Buccino, a spokesman for the state's emergency management office. Flooding forced 100 people in Ocean Township to evacuate, and in Ocean Grove, south of Asbury Park, about two dozen homes were evacuated after Fletcher Lake flooded. State officials were also watching two dams in Wall Township: Old Mill Pond Dam and a dam in Allaire State Park, which had already been breached by last night, with water flowing across Allenwood Road. Farther north, where the storm had created havoc over the past two days, it was much the same. More than seven inches of rain has fallen since Tuesday in areas of Bergen and Essex Counties, and by yesterday afternoon the Passaic River had overflowed its banks in some areas with flooding that ranged from moderate to severe. In Fairfield, about 15 miles northwest of Newark, a bridge over the Passaic River hung just a few inches above the rising water. Roads bordering the river were closed, and firefighters zipped from door to door in pontoon boats, advising people to leave. Walking from his house near the Passaic, Frank Lach, in hip waders, said he had about a foot and a half of water on his property. ''We've got hit before, we're getting hit now, we'll get hit again,'' he said, shaking his head with a chuckle. ''There is nothing else I can do except wait to get back in.'' In Lodi, the police said that 100 people had been evacuated from 15 homes and two complexes for the elderly. In Wayne, about 75 people were evacuated. Roads were closed in several parts of the state. Some flood victims, however, seemed to be on their way to drying out, or at least moving out of danger yesterday. In Oakland, the Ramapo River began to recede, giving residents who had evacuated a chance to return home. Walt Kuebler, 52, and his wife Kristine, 46, said they were ecstatic that the water was going down. They have lived on Doty Road for 20 years, they have a 19-year-old daughter and a 13-year-old son, and they have no plans to leave. ""It's very pretty here year-round,"" Mrs. Kuebler said. ""It only stinks when it floods."""
"When the brown, murky waters of the Ramapo River crept up the seventh of thirteen stairs that separate the two floors of Edith Seltenheim's house here on Friday, she began to pray for relief, but not for rescue. In the half-century that she has lived in the house, Ms. Seltenheim, 83, has experienced more floods than she can remember. But not for one of them has she left her home on the appropriately named Lakeview Terrace in the flood-prone Pleasureland section of this Bergen County town, though she now uses the first floor only for storage, with kitchen, bathroom and living area on the second. Since the Ramapo River moved into Ms. Seltenheim's house on Sunday, she has been outside only once -- earlier in the week, when the water receded briefly, to buy more frozen dinners at a nearby grocery store. ''I keep praying the rain will stop so the water will go down,'' she said. ''But I won't move, because I like it here, and I can't afford to leave.'' Like Ms. Seltenheim, other residents of Pleasureland -- which sits on low ground along the river and is named for a now-closed pool club -- say that the costs of leaving, and the joys of staying in dry weather, keep them living next to, and sometimes in, the Ramapo River. Dan McDonnell has lived in a 3,000-square-foot house on Lakeview Terrace for the past 17 years. Mr. McDonnell, 50, says he wants to move out of the flood zone, but he won't. The recent floods have damaged his house and reduced the salability of the property, which means he could not buy a home of comparable size anywhere else. ''I'm sick of this,'' he said, ''and I want to sell this house, but right now I'll take a $100,000 loss.'' Bass, perch, trout, herons, turkeys, ducks and whitetail deer keep Henry Heschle, 76, in his home on Island Terrace, about 300 yards upstream from Mr. McDonnell. Mr. Heschle says he loves the quiet of the Ramapo Mountains, the fishing and the wildlife viewing. For a decade he has lived in Pleasureland, which he calls ''a little enclave away from the rest of the world.'' ''It's a hard thing to say right now, but it's very, very nice here when it's not flooding,'' he said on Friday morning as he waded through thigh-high water to his car, which he had parked on higher ground. According to the Oakland police, 30 people were evacuated on Sunday from Pleasureland, when the first flooding hit. Four who had refused to leave on Sunday did so on Wednesday when the waters, after receding a bit, rose again. Though the police say dozens of homes were damaged, most residents said the flooding was confined to their basements. One Lakeview Terrace resident, Anton Oltmanns, 41, echoed many of his neighbors when he boasted that his house never floods -- though he acknowledged that the water in his basement was five feet deep at the moment. Mr. Oltmanns, and scores of other residents, said that the current flooding was the worst since Hurricane Floyd in 1999. More minor floods, they say, usually come every year or two and, so long as valuable belongings are kept out of basements or high on basement shelves, do not cause serious inconvenience. But residents say the flooding problem got worse two years ago, after the Army Corps of Engineers began building locks near the Pompton Dam downstream to cut down on the flooding in the area. The work itself has caused water to back up behind the dam. Gina McDonnell, 47, who is married to Dan McDonnell, hopes that once the locks project is finished, which is supposed to be in May 2006, she can get rid of her sump pump and enjoy life along the river. ''The river is great, but this isn't a river,'' she said pointing at the waterline halfway up her neighbor's doors. ''This is a reservoir.''"
"The official death toll in the floods that devastated Guatemala last week held steady on Tuesday at 652 people. But authorities for the first time began to acknowledge that the hundreds of missing were probably dead as well, and that the final toll could be 1,100 to 1,300 people. In what is left of Panabaj village, Mayor Diego Esquina said in an interview that he estimated there were 700 bodies still buried beneath the mud. Villagers, working with little more than machetes, hoes and shovels, had recovered about 70 bodies of people who had been buried alive. And on Monday, metal poles with red plastic ribbons marked the spots where more bodies had been detected by specially trained dogs. But rather than continuing their digging, residents decided to turn their village into a mass grave. It was a difficult decision for them and for dozens of other Mayan Indian communities for whom death is almost as powerful as life, and who had watched thousands of their people massacred and dumped in mass graves during this country's 36-year civil war. ''People do not want to leave their relatives, but they are afraid to stay because they say the mud could come again,'' said Marta Navichoc Cotuc, the wife of a farmer, who donated a big basket of tortillas to a shelter near Panabaj. ''And they are tired.'' Indeed, more than a week after rainstorms from Hurricane Stan set off deadly mudslides across the Guatemalan highlands, fallout from the disaster continued to overwhelm this impoverished country of 14.5 million people. Leaders of rescue and relief agencies said they had been stretched beyond capacity. ''I have some tens of thousand of people in shelters and I am running out of food for them,'' said Edwin Bravo of the International Red Cross. ''I have not sent protein out for days. The shelters are running on rice and beans.'' Gladys Acosta, coordinator of the United Nations offices here, said the $21 million that Guatemala had requested in emergency relief would not be used for reconstruction, but just to provide for the basic needs of the mostly poor, mostly indigenous people affected by the storm. Political leaders in Mexico said they also were afraid that the death toll there would be much higher than it is now. In Chiapas, where state authorities currently report an estimated 29 dead, Emilio Zebadua, a former state interior minister and current candidate for governor, said that entire neighborhoods in Tapachula had washed away and that there were parts of the state that remained out of communication. ''The number of dead is going to grow,'' Mr. Zebadua said. ''If you look at the damage, the official number seems absurd. ''The story of this storm is not over yet.''"
"Hurricane Wilma churned toward heavily populated southwestern Florida and the Florida Keys on Sunday evening after pounding the Yucatán Coast of Mexico, still a major storm, with winds of more than 110 miles per hour and the power to generate devastating flooding. The leading edge of the hurricane was expected to strike the Gulf Coast of Florida shortly after midnight as a Category 3 storm, with the eye moving ashore near dawn. Winds of up to 70 m.p.h. were forecast as far north as Tampa. Tornadoes were reported Sunday night on the Atlantic Coast north of Lake Okeechobee and near Melbourne and Cocoa Beach. The storm was expected to rapidly move northeast across the state, reaching the Atlantic Ocean east of Lake Okeechobee, near where Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne made landfall last year. As hundreds of thousands of people prepared for Hurricane Wilma, another tropical system dumped torrential rain on Haiti and the Dominican Republic on Sunday. The Associated Press reported that at least one person was killed in Haiti. Tropical Storm Alpha was the 22nd named system in the Atlantic Ocean this season, breaking the record set in 1933 and forcing weather officials to turn to the Greek alphabet for a name. The storm, which was downgraded to a tropical depression later Sunday, also made this hurricane season the most active since officials began keeping records 150 years ago. In its wake, Hurricane Wilma left the Yucatán Coast a wreck, devastating the international airport, eroding beaches and severely damaging dozens of huge resort hotels, robbing tens of thousands of Mexicans of their livelihoods. With food scarce and few businesses open, looting broke out as soon as the storm passed. ''It's so sad,'' said Oscar Kury, a manufacturer of uniforms for hotel workers, as he surveyed the damaged discos, bars, restaurants and hotels along Cancún's famous tourist strip. ''It's going to take a year to rebuild this.'' Residents and tourists emerged from shelters and homes after 60 hours of howling wind and rain to find Cancún transformed from a Caribbean playground to a tangled maze of flooded streets, downed power lines, toppled signs and broken glass. At daylight, looters broke into stores, carrying off food, televisions and computers, among other things. The police made arrests, but they were stretched too thin to stop the stealing. Officers also discovered three bodies, apparently those of homeless people. Some of the 20,000 tourists who weathered the storm in schools, cultural centers and small downtown hotels began to get desperate after a third day of eating little more than tuna fish and crackers. Most had left luggage at the resorts and were not allowed to retrieve their belongings. In Playa del Carmen, just south of Cancún, several inmates fled a prison when a wall collapsed. Flooding severed Isla Mujeres, a 4.2-mile-long island off Cancún, into three parts, and it remained cut off from the mainland. There were still no reports of how its 10,000 inhabitants fared, said Gov. Félix González Canto of Quintana Roo province. As Wilma turned toward southwestern Florida, tens of thousands of residents fled. The storm lost strength as it crossed land, but regained Category 3 strength as it crossed the Gulf. In Collier County, which includes Naples and is one of the nation's fastest-growing regions with about 300,000 residents, officials estimated that more than 80 percent of the population had evacuated and that more people were still leaving as evening approached. Gov. Jeb Bush said he was especially concerned about residents of the Keys, the majority of whom were ignoring mandatory evacuation orders. ''I cannot emphasize enough to the folks that live in the Florida Keys: a hurricane is coming,'' Mr. Bush said in Tallahassee on Sunday. ''Perhaps people are saying, 'I'm going to hunker down.' They shouldn't do that. They should evacuate, and there's very little time left to do so.'' Ben Nelson, the state meteorologist, said the storm would likely maintain hurricane strength as it crossed Florida, possibly bringing winds of more than 100 m.p.h. to the heavily populated counties of Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade. Because of the storm's sprawling size, strong winds could affect almost all areas south of Orlando, Mr. Nelson said. Across the state, local officials said they were well prepared for the storm, having learned ample lessons from the seven other hurricanes to hit Florida in the last 14 months and from the recent troubles after Hurricane Katrina. Governor Bush said gasoline remained abundant along evacuation routes and that much more, at least 220 million gallons, was waiting at the state's ports. An additional 131 million gallons are scheduled to arrive on 29 ships over the next few days, said Mr. Bush, whose state experienced such serious gas shortages during last year's hurricanes that many drivers were stranded along highways. On an average day, Floridians consume about 23 million gallons of fuel. About 2,400 Florida National Guard troops were activated for duties including traffic management and search-and-recovery efforts, Mr. Bush said. An additional 3,000 troops are on standby. Mr. Bush said search-and-recovery teams, with hovercraft, boats and nearly three dozen Chinook and Blackhawk helicopters, were ready to enter the Keys if roads were impassable. Officials in Collier County put teams with airboats and swamp buggies at several staging areas. More than 200 truckloads of ice, 200 truckloads of water and 86,000 meals were waiting in Jacksonville and at Homestead Air Force Base, south of Miami. And nearly 7,000 utility workers with more than 3,000 trucks were poised to restore power to homes and businesses, hundreds of thousands of which could be affected by the storm. At a concrete bunker on the edge of Naples, Dan E. Summers, the director of emergency management for Collier County, took a nap on Sunday afternoon, expecting a long night with Hurricane Wilma. ''We're very well prepared,'' he said. At the crowded Tin City Docks in downtown, boat owners were stripping radar and communications gear from their craft, tightening their lines and hoping for the best, though they acknowledged a substantial storm surge was likely to devastate the marina. Throughout the city, Parks Department workers in small dump trucks with flashing lights were scooping up tree limbs, lids for garbage cans and other debris from the streets. ''You don't want any missiles flying around,'' Steve Madsen said as he paused his truck in the Old Town section of Naples. People in Florida have been following the progress of Hurricane Wilma since last Wednesday, when its winds reached 175 m.p.h. and the National Hurricane Center in Miami declared it the most powerful Atlantic hurricane ever. Residents gassed up their cars and laid in supplies, and they waited. Many decided to head north to hotels and homes of relatives and friends. Others temporized to see whether the hurricane would actually head toward them. ''Wilma has been tormenting us all week,'' said John Turner, 49, a real estate broker, as he stood on the beach watching the gulf boil up on Sunday afternoon. Two people were swimming and a half-dozen young men were trying to surf in the still fairly flat seas. In the Yucatán on Sunday, the scene was far from placid. On the 17-mile-long barrier island that is home to Cancún's resort hotels, the damage was extensive. In most places, the beaches were stripped of their famous white sand, leaving nothing but limestone rocks. Almost every hotel suffered broken windows, smashed signs and fallen glass walls. Some had structural damage, with rooms and balconies facing the ocean ripped away. Several lobbies were gutted by the swirling storm surge. At the Park Royal Hotel, the banquet room was reduced to a sea of glass and twisted aluminum studs. The winds destroyed the seaside restaurant, and the waves reduced the beach to a rocky slope, studded with the remains of thatched beach umbrellas. Carlos Rangel Castelazo, 63, drove his pickup truck through the floods to see what was left of his marina on the lagoon side of the island, where he rents out powerboats. ''It's gone,'' he said. ''Completely submerged.'' ''I think the intention of everyone is to try to rebuild something for the high season of December,'' he said. ''But it's very little time.'' On Sunday afternoon, the government seemed overwhelmed with the task of clearing roads and getting food to evacuees. Many neighborhoods in the northern part of Cancún were still flooded, and marines were busy ferrying food to temporary shelters. The Mexican army brought in bulldozers and backhoes to clear the main coastal highway from Cancún to Chetumal, the province capital. Government officials were making no predictions about when electricity would be restored or the airport would be reopened. President Vicente Fox surveyed the damage in Cancún by helicopter on Sunday afternoon, but several trucks of relief aid promised by the federal government had yet to arrive from Mérida, the closest city. The highway was jammed with cars fleeing the area, witnesses said. When he arrived in Chetumal, Mr. Fox pledged $1.1 billion to begin reconstruction. ''Right now, we should worry about lives, worry about families' safety in shelters, worry that they are fine in a shelter, worry that the shelters are well-supplied, and after that we will go into material things,'' he said. But mindful of the region's importance to Mexico's tourism industry, Mr. Fox added, ''Our greatest worry is restoring tourism to its full operation quickly.'' STORM AND CRISIS: HURRICANE WILMA"
"As floodwaters from the Ramapo River receded yesterday from a section of Oakland, N.J., residents and officials were drying out and pondering nature's indifference to human plans. Oakland, in north-central New Jersey, was one of a number of areas in the Northeast hit by flooding over the weekend as heavy rains drenched towns from the New York region into New England. Nine to 10 inches of rain over the weekend in parts of New Jersey led to the evacuation of some 30 of the 115 residents of Oakland's Pleasureland section. The flooding was both predictable and similar to prior floods, residents and officials said. For two years, Oakland officials and the Army Corps of Engineers have been working to finish a series of locks on the Pompton Dam that would relieve or eliminate flooding that is partly the result of the dam itself. The project is due to be completed in May. Mayor John Szabo said that dry spells over the past few years had allowed the Corps's engineers to build a temporary dam to wall off and reroute the river around the area where they were installing the new locks. But the project has temporarily restricted the flow of water into the spillway over the dam. As long as there were no heavy rains, there were no problems caused by water backing up behind the dam. ''I guess Mother Nature's patience ran out,'' said Mr. Szabo, adding that the scheduled completion of the gates was likely to be delayed. ''I think the area would have flooded even without the work in progress but the question is just how much.'' Similar flooding occurred in April, and officials developed a plan to grind down a 100-foot section of the dam by 18 inches to allow more water to flow over it. But according to Mr. Szabo and state officials, the State Department of Environmental Protection, which regulates dams, expressed concern last week whether the equipment that would be used to grind down the dam would achieve the desired results. State, local and Army Corps officials scheduled a meeting for today to discuss other temporary flood prevention options while the $25 million permanent lock and gate system is being built. Elsewhere in the Northeast, some areas in western Massachusetts and southwestern New Hampshire received up to 11 inches of rain this weekend, flooding rivers, washing out bridges and, in some cases, ripping away homes and their foundations. At least three people died in New Hampshire, two of them when a bridge they were driving on washed out. Some of the worst flooding was in southwestern New Hampshire, where Gov. John Lynch declared a state of emergency on Sunday. Five hundred National Guard troops were activated, 100 of them in Keene, where one-third of the city was under water."
"It is practically an article of faith in Louisiana that if the state's marshes had not been allowed to deteriorate over the years, New Orleans and other flooded areas would have been preserved from the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. Many people quote a rough rule of thumb that every mile of marsh reduces by a foot the height of a storm surge -- the pulse of water that hurricanes push on shore. ''The marshes are our first line of defense,'' people here say. But not all coastal scientists agree. Yes, they say, in a weak hurricane, a tropical storm or even in the winds and rain that can accompany winter cold fronts, healthy marshes can soak up water that might otherwise cause flooding. But would healthy marshes have saved New Orleans from the devastation of Katrina? ''Not a chance,'' said Joseph Kelley, a coastal scientist at the University of Maine who was a member of an expert panel convened by the National Academy of Sciences to study Louisiana's plans for marsh restoration. In the first place, the floodwater that caused the most damage in New Orleans entered the city not from the marshes but from Lake Pontchartrain and, possibly, the Mississippi Gulf Outlet, a much-reviled canal that runs from the river at New Orleans southeast to the gulf. If it had come up from the south, it would probably have overwhelmed any buffering effects of the marshes. In any event, Dr. Kelley added, the 2.5 miles = 1 foot equation ''seems excessively precise.'' Dr. Kelley said people interested in marsh restoration had been tempted to use storm protection as a rationale ''for the simple reason that they had to, they had to justify spending money.'' But estimating the role marshes play in buffering storms ''is very complicated,'' he said. ''Fundamentally it seems subjective.'' CORNELIA DEAN"
"Amid all the arguments over how to rebuild this pummeled city, there is one universally held article of faith here: New Orleans must have a flood protection system strong enough to withstand Category 5 storms, the worst that nature can spawn. It is a rallying cry heard on radio broadcasts and in a front-page editorial in The Times-Picayune, in ruined neighborhoods and in corporate boardrooms. Strong protection is the linchpin that everything else depends on, said Joe Veninata, the owner of a shopping center and rental homes in the Gentilly neighborhood, ''for people to come to the city and invest, for the people to feel secure.'' ''Without that,'' Mr. Veninata said, ''we can't build New Orleans anymore.'' Building Category 5 protection, however, is proving to be an astronomically expensive and technically complex proposition. It would involve far more than just higher levees: there would have to be extensive changes to the city's system of drainage canals and pumps, environmental restoration on a vast scale to replenish buffering wetlands and barrier islands, and even sea gates far out of town near the Gulf of Mexico. The cost estimates are still fuzzy, but the work would easily cost more than $32 billion, state officials say, and could take decades to complete. The current levee system around the city was designed to withstand the equivalent of a Category 3 storm, and the Army Corps of Engineers is spending $1 billion to bring the damaged sections to their original design strength. They plan to complete that effort before next year's hurricane season, which begins on June 1. But a sense of how much more extensive Category 5 protection would be can be found 23 miles east of downtown New Orleans at a strait called the Rigolets, which connects the gulf and Lake Pontchartrain. For nearly 200 years, the brick bastion of Fort Pike has looked down on the two-thirds-mile gap, which the fort was built to protect against military threats from land or sea. These days, however, the threat is from the sea itself. A surge from storms like Hurricane Katrina can push water through the gap and send floods deep into the city. So engineers and other experts say that the Corps of Engineers should build a gate across the Rigolets (pronounced RIG-uh-lees) that could be shut in the face of a storm. From a viewpoint by the remains of Fort Pike looking across the sparkling water, the project seems enormously daunting, on a scale of the flood systems that protect cities like London and Amsterdam. And it is only one step toward the goal of fortifying New Orleans to the highest level. Congress only recently agreed to give $8 million to the corps for a study about providing increased protection for South Louisiana, with a preliminary report due in six months. The final plan is two years away. While every expert has a list of things that would upgrade the city's flood controls, Category 5 protection is not easy to define, experts say. Dan Hitchings, director of Task Force Hope, the corps's Hurricane Katrina relief effort, noted that Category 3 hurricanes were specifically defined while Category 5 includes any hurricanes with winds greater than 155 miles an hour and a storm surge greater than 18 feet. ''What's the top end for a Cat 5 hurricane?'' Mr. Hitchings said. ''There isn't one.'' Herbert Saffir, a co-creator of the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, said he would not recommend designing a Category 5 protection system because such a storm would be unlikely to hit any particular spot more than once in 500 years. Only three Category 5 storms in recorded history have made landfall in the United States, Mr. Saffir said; Hurricane Katrina had been a Category 5 in the gulf but was at Category 4 at most when it landed east of New Orleans near Buras, La. Others disagree. Maarten van der Vlist, an engineer with Rijkswaterstaat, the Dutch equivalent of the Corps of Engineers, said that after a disastrous flood in 1953, the Netherlands chose to protect against flooding that occurs once every 10,000 years. Most Category 5 proposals for New Orleans include devices to close seaward passageways like the Rigolets and gates at the mouths of today's drainage and navigation canals. Jurjen Battjes, a professor of civil engineering at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and an expert on levee systems, said that approach had worked well in his country. ''You don't want to let your enemy invade deeply into your territory,'' Professor Battjes said. ''Close your fence at the outside.'' Current levees can be made higher and stronger, and any new system might also include internal levees that would prevent a breach in one spot from swamping large stretches of the city, said Thomas F. Wolff, an associate professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering at Michigan State University. Levees, Professor Wolff said, are known as ''series systems,'' which he compared to ''Christmas tree lights from the 1950's -- when one goes out, they all go out.'' That levee work must be coupled with the restoration of coastal marshes and barrier islands that can blunt the progress of a storm, said Ivor van Heerden, a professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering at Louisiana State University and deputy director of the university's hurricane center. ''Where you had wetland, the levees were not eroded,'' Professor van Heerden said of Hurricane Katrina's damage, ''and where you did not have wetlands, the levees were annihilated.'' But local efforts are only part of the challenge. Many experts say it is no less important to reorganize the nation's method of designing and building flood systems. The current patchwork of local, state and federal agencies responsible for flood protection must be unified and streamlined, said Robert G. Bea, a professor of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. The Corps of Engineers should manage the project, as it has done historically, Professor Bea said, but it has to avoid the piecemeal approach that has made the system more vulnerable over time. (The Louisiana Legislature recently voted down a proposal, however, that would have merged the levee boards that maintain the region's flood systems.) Experts say that New Orleans also needs restrictions on where people can build, and a new, independent organization that has the power to set standards for levee strength around the nation and to inspect them. Greater emphasis on evacuation and safety plans, too, would be necessary. But corps officials say that it is impossible to predict the next storm. Lt. Gen. Carl A. Strock, the chief of engineers for the corps, said in an interview in Washington that focusing too tightly on what went wrong about Hurricane Katrina could lead to less effective plans for the future. ''We don't need to be fighting the last war all the time,'' General Strock said. The next storm could come up through the center of the city, or along the west side, swamping the western river basins and overflowing the levees along the Mississippi River that held during Hurricane Katrina. Even if many of the current proposals can be accomplished, Mr. van der Vlist said, it remains hard to know whether they would really be able to withstand a Category 5 storm. ''In the Netherlands, we don't have hurricanes like you have,'' he said. The low-lying nation is protected against the forces of water, but does not experience the crushing power of hurricane winds. New Orleans may be able to get by with a protection level less than that required to resist a Category 5 storm, if it is robustly designed and built, said Robert A. Dalrymple, a professor of civil engineering at Johns Hopkins University and a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers team that investigated the levee breaches. ''If you have a Category 3 protection system and a Category 4 storm hits it, there will be overtopping of the walls,'' Professor Dalrymple said. But if the walls can be built so that they can resist the scouring action of the overflowing water, and ''if the walls stay there, there will only be flooding for several hours,'' he added. The street drains and pumping stations could then remove the water. The cost of any significant upgrade, however, will be enormous -- more than the $21 billion spent on New York City after 9/11, but less than the $57 billion to be spent on highway construction and maintenance in the recent federal transportation bill. Washington and state governments spend about $160 billion a year on infrastructure, including roads, transit and utilities, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. Given a large federal deficit and other demands for money, however, there is still no indication that Washington will pay the $32 billion or more for full protection. Scott A. Angelle, the secretary of the Department of Natural Resources for Louisiana, said that fortifying New Orleans to the highest level could be accomplished by giving Louisiana half of revenues from federal leasing for offshore oil and gas drilling beyond the three-mile territorial limit in the gulf. The plan, which has been proposed in legislation by Louisiana's United States senators, Mary L. Landrieu and David Vitter, would produce as much as $2.5 billion a year. The state currently receives no money for drilling beyond the limit. The work ahead, Mr. Angelle said, is daunting but certainly possible. ''We can fix anything that we focus on,'' he said. ''We, as a people, and we, as Americans.''"
"Standing on the slab that was once her Gulf Coast retirement home, Jocelyn Turnbough has a clear vision of her own Hurricane Katrina counterpunch: a new seaside estate, with a wraparound veranda, a sunroom and a small wading pool out front. Central to this rebuilding plan is Ms. Turnbough's intention to ignore a plea from the Federal Emergency Management Agency that her new home be elevated on stilts. ''At my age, I don't want to have to go up steps,'' said Ms. Turnbough, 69, a retired middle school teacher. ''I want to be able to walk in at ground level.'' The conflict between FEMA's request and Ms. Turnbough's desires demonstrates a broad clash here along the Gulf Coast over whether to cede large swaths of land to nature, to rebuild much as it was, or to rebuild homes, at a higher price, with more robust foundations and on structures that raise them above the ground. The debate is playing out on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, with a cast that includes storm victims, coastal engineers, mortgage lenders, the insurance industry, and local, state and federal government officials. FEMA ignited the discussion by issuing late last month a jigsaw puzzle of 228 new maps that, when pieced together, make up the entire 80 miles of Mississippi coast and reach as much as 22 miles inland. These maps represent the biggest simultaneous proposed expansion of federally defined flood zones in the history of the 37-year-old National Flood Insurance Program. The maps for the Louisiana coast will be published early next year. The maps for the two states, based on damage caused by Katrina and other hurricanes in the past 20 years, are advisory for now because it will take FEMA at least a year to confirm their accuracy. During this critical rebuilding period, it is up to the local governments to decide if they will honor the agency's request to adopt the more conservative and more costly standards. But when the maps become final, the federal agency will have the power to force the hands of local governments, since it can ban cities and their residents from the flood insurance program if they do not respect the official maps. ''These are very hard decisions,'' said Todd Davison, FEMA's regional director of mitigation. ''There is no denying that. The local officials have to balance the need to allow people to fix up houses that can be repaired and to take some hardship off of the crisis they are in, and at the same time not knowingly put people in harm's way.'' The looming changes are already causing divisions along the coast. In Mississippi, elected officials from Long Beach, Pass Christian and unincorporated sections of Hancock County have decided to allow residents to rebuild, at least for now, according to the existing flood maps. In Jackson County and communities including Waveland, D'Iberville and Bay St. Louis, local officials have agreed to add about four feet to the required minimum elevations in existing flood zones, but have declined, so far, to expand the flood zones according to FEMA's recommended boundaries. The biggest cities on Mississippi's coast, Biloxi, Gulfport and Pascagoula, have not yet taken a formal position, but at least some elected leaders in these communities have made it clear they have objections. Only unincorporated Harrison County and Moss Point, a small city, have voted to adopt entirely the new FEMA standards. In communities that have resisted, elected officials say they fear now is the worst time to radically increase land-use standards, forcing residents who have already lost almost everything to dig deeper into their pockets to rebuild. ''For us to hit them with an additional burden after what they have been through -- to me, that is ludicrous,'' said Richard Notter, a Long Beach alderman and electrical engineer, who voted to reject the FEMA maps. ''No one who has a heart and soul would ever vote to do that.'' Many of the homes wiped out by Hurricane Katrina were built on lots that were swept clear in 1969 when Hurricane Camille hit. Yet even with that knowledge, Chip McDermott, alderman at large in Pass Christian, said that in a community where only about 900 of 6,000 residents remain -- and many of those are in trailers or a tent city -- trying to plan now for the next catastrophe is hard. ''Survival right now is the main thing,'' Mr. McDermott said. ''We are not going to have a town unless we get some people back here. We are going to be a town in name only.'' Raising a new house off the ground to comply with the proposed FEMA standards would cost $2,000 to $30,000 depending on the value of the house and the type of foundation required to meet the potential flood intensity. The work could be as simple as an elevated foundation or as complex as reinforced, deep-set structural columns that would support a house entirely on tall stilts. How high the house would be off the ground would depend on its location, but the heights would be from a few feet to 20 feet, with more typical range being 8 to 14 feet, Mr. Davison said. For years, geologists and flood plain engineers said that the rush to build along the fragile coasts of the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico was the brick-and-mortar version of irrational exuberance. And with the recent surge in the frequency and violence of hurricanes, the stakes have never been so devastatingly laid bare. More than 1,075 people have been confirmed dead in Louisiana and 230 in Mississippi, with dozens of others still missing. More than $23 billion in flood insurance claims are expected from along the Gulf Coast, from more than 200,000 property owners. The single biggest previous payout was Hurricane Ivan last year, which cost the federally backed program $1.45 billion in claims. A federal bailout of the insurance program, which is supposed to be supported by premiums, will most likely be required. Some engineers say the only rational solution, in some sections of the Gulf Coast, is to cede these fragile areas, and not rebuild. ''It is time to cut our ties with the most vulnerable of our nation's coastal areas,'' said Robert S. Young, an associate professor of geology at Western Carolina University, in testimony last month before Congress. More than $1 billion in federal disaster aid will be available in Mississippi to help buy out homeowners who live in extremely flood-prone spots, elevate whole neighborhoods in some cases or rebuild schools or community centers more robustly or in safer locations. People like Ms. Turnbough who choose to rebuild soon in areas that do not comply with the new proposals will still be eligible for flood insurance if construction predates the adoption of the FEMA mandates by their local governments. But here along the coast, FEMA officials said, they realize they must do more. They are trying, they said, to strike a balance between protecting life and property and allowing coastal communities like Long Beach to rise again. ''There are proven techniques for building housing in these flood-prone areas that can withstand these flood forces and significantly reduce damage,'' Mr. Davison said. The last time large flood zones along the Mississippi coast were comprehensively remapped was in the mid-1980's, at the end of a relatively quiet hurricane period, Mr. Davison said. With major hurricanes like Elena in 1985, Andrew in 1992, Georges in 1998, Ivan in 2004 and Katrina in 2005, the area vulnerable to flooding in a so-called ''100-year storm'' is much bigger, and the projected flood depths along the coast are much deeper. Some local officials say that the new FEMA advisory maps call for unreasonable standards that will drive up housing prices and threaten whole neighborhoods. ''This is not realistic. It's not practical. It is overkill, and we can start a push back,'' Mayor Brent Warr of Gulfport told the City Council at a workshop last week at City Hall, in Gulfport's devastated downtown. Mr. Warr says he recognizes that the maps will need to change to expand the flood zone. The question, he said, is by how much. FEMA's redrawn maps would put 6,233 houses and other structures in Gulfport in the flood zone, more than twice the current number. That, he said, is just too many. ''We are going to be more conservative,'' Mr. Warr said in an interview. ''But we have to come up with a plan that still offers an opportunity for neighborhoods to exist.'' Officials at FEMA said they recognized that Hurricane Katrina was an extraordinary storm, creating a wall of water as high as 30 feet in some communities. So the flood zones in the new FEMA maps, in certain areas, are smaller than the area inundated by water from Katrina. The conflict between the agency's advice and the stand taken by many of the local governments has left many residents confused. James Kirby lives on 39th Street in Gulfport, about a mile and a half from the coast. After a neighborhood bayou overflowed with waters forced inland by Hurricane Katrina, the floors of his small house collapsed, his brick walls cracked and everything inside was destroyed. On FEMA's proposed flood map, his neighborhood is a tiny yellow square surrounded by blue, indicating that it was flooded and will now be included in the flood zone. Residents in these areas are generally required to get flood insurance, and those outside them typically are not. The Gulfport City Council has not yet acted on FEMA's recommendations, and Mr. Kirby said he had not decided whether to move elsewhere, stay put and rebuild higher, or repair his home where it is. ''It's a sad situation,'' Mr. Kirby, 74, said. ''There are no good choices.'' If homeowners were insured for flood damage before the storm, they were eligible to get as much as $30,000 in extra assistance to comply with new, more demanding flood requirements. But like thousands of Gulf Coast residents who did not previously live in a designated flood zone, Mr. Kirby did not have flood insurance. In Long Beach, where Ms. Turnbough lives, little new construction is under way. The scene is postapocalyptic, with smashed cars in living rooms and household items strewn about. Yet with the many American flags placed, after the storm, at the edges of yards, as well as hand-painted signs with slogans like ''We Can Do It, Y'All,'' there is a sense of defiance here, almost as if residents feel they must prove that they are stronger than the storm. Mr. Davison and other FEMA officials said future builders should take note of the few homes along the coast where property owners, prior to Hurricane Katrina, chose to build houses that were higher off the ground than required. One such elevated house in Pass Christian is built of concrete and stands 22 feet above sea level, compared with the current 14-foot requirement. ''It survived,'' said John Plisich, a civil engineer with FEMA, as he stood outside the fortresslike house, surveying the slabs of destroyed homes surrounding it. Yet even this house, which was built by a structural engineer, was flooded by Hurricane Katrina's extraordinary surge. ''The coastal environment is a harsh one,'' Mr. Plisich said, as the afternoon sky turned dark and a heavy downpour began. ''People should understand that.''"
"The monsoon season this year brought India the mantle of a would-be world power with nuclear weapons in its arsenal and a friend in George W. Bush. Then came the revenge of the real. Fluke rains a week ago submerged Mumbai, the country's financial and entertainment capital, and unearthed the sorry state of the urban infrastructure that Mumbaikars already know too well. Cattle carcasses floated in ponds that suddenly materialized on city roads. Commuters died in their cars. Shanties were swept away. Residents of first-floor apartments lost all their worldly possessions. Even a week later, when the rains had subsided and many commuter trains returned to near normal service, the streets of this always hustling, always harried coastal city remained eerily quiet. People simply stayed home. On July 26, Mumbai, or Bombay as it is also known, received a record downpour of more than 30 inches in a 24-hour period. Rains came again on Monday, flights in and out of the city were curtailed, and though the death toll varied from account to account, the numbers were still staggering: 962 people had died across the state, according to officials Tuesday evening, among them 406 in Mumbai. Estimates of losses varied widely, from $700 million to $2.8 billion, in industry, agriculture and infrastructure combined. A week into the disaster, it became clear that nature alone could not be blamed, and anger began to boil among the citizenry. Why did the downpour cause such a calamity? The storm drain system, much of it built a century ago, has been clogged with garbage. The shanties of the poor, as well as the trash of the rich, have blocked gutters and creeks. Mangrove swamps, which act as nature's bathtub during the rainy season, have been built over. A river that once allowed storm water to be carried down to the Arabian Sea has since been pinched by the construction of a new road that is to connect a northern suburb to midtown Mumbai. Called Mithi, or Sweet, River, it once spawned oyster beds; now it swims with feces. ''The past has caught up with us, about which little can be done,'' Gerson D'Cunha, a former advertising executive and the founder of a civic group called Agni, or Fire, said by telephone. ''It is bad weather that has caused part of the tragedy, but it is bad government policy that has compounded bad weather.'' For years, environmentalists and civic activists have been screaming about what they regard as the unchecked development of the city, greased by spiraling land prices. Now they are saying they hope their city officials will take note and begin to make amends. Government officials came under fire, too, for how they responded to the disaster. Why were streets not cleared for emergency vehicles? people asked. Why did relief not reach the neediest much sooner? What would happen, a former municipal commissioner, Jamshed Kanga, wondered aloud, if Mumbai were to be hit by even a moderate earthquake? More than half of the city -- not only its beggars, but its maids and security guards and washerwomen -- live in slums. ''You have a tragedy of this scale and you realize how the infrastructure is totally damaged,'' Mr. Kanga said. ''Naturally it does a tremendous amount of damage to the reputation of the city.'' Mumbai's ambitions to become a world-class city like Shanghai, as it was once suggested, or Dubai, as it was suggested before that, fell under a wet blanket. That it happened in India's iconic city of strivers, and not in some destitute corner, only highlight the bricks-and-mortar challenge -- or rather, sewage and storm-drain challenge -- that faces a country keen for a seat on the United Nations Security Council. The Maharashtra State chief minister, Vilasrao Deshmukh, said Tuesday that the scale of the disaster did not allow government relief to reach everyone on time, but that government workers were today going door to door to provide rice and kerosene to all affected families. ''It was unprecedented,'' he said, according to a Reuters report. ''What could any government do?'' ''We will look into the urban development issue, but this is not the time to do it,'' Mr. Deshmukh added. ''Our priority now is rescue, relief and rehabilitation.'' Mumbai being what it is, however, there were optimists. Mr. Kanga said he hoped that disaster could be converted to blessing and that building laws would be made stricter and infrastructure repaired. A member of Parliament from Mumbai, Milind Deora, seized on it as an opportunity to devolve power to city officials who would be accountable to citizens; currently, a state-appointed municipal commissioner is technically responsible for the city. Bittu Sahgal, editor of the magazine Sanctuary Asia, said the sheer scale of the devastation from the flood perhaps would prompt a review of urban development plans that had effectively destroyed Mumbai ecological assets, the very assets that could have prevented waterlogging. ''We've got 25,000 flamingos; we've got a 103 kilometer national park with free-ranging leopards; we've got a seascape that is among the most beautiful in world,'' Mr. Sahgal said. ''These assets should be defended. Decisions are in hands of people who don't have ecological foresight or hindsight. This has been a rude awakening.'' Kiran Nagarkar, who counts himself as a Mumbaikar who likes to grouse about Mumbaikars, said he had witnessed a spirit of practical camaraderie and not that of a ''besieged city.'' ''I don't think even on our worst days, we don't breast-beat -- 'Poor us, what's happening to us,''' said Mr. Nagarkar, a novelist and playwright. ''It's more 'Can I lend a hand?' and 'Let me get home.' It's very matter of fact, practical and helpful.''"
"Don't put it off any longer. That is the advice of specialists in planning for disasters, who say too many small businesses are courting ruin by failing to take fuller precautions against fires, floods and, increasingly, the loss of critical data stored in computers that go on the fritz. Jane Vitart wishes she had acted sooner. When the Delaware River overflowed behind the French bakery and cafe she owns with her husband, Joel, in New Hope, Pa., last September, a retaining wall protected her shop. That lulled the couple into a false sense of security, and when the flood waters rose again in April, they did not bother to evacuate their equipment or their computer as they had seven months earlier. Big mistake. ''The river rose four feet higher than it did in September and we ended up with 31/2 feet of water in our bakery,'' Ms. Vitart said. ''The kitchen, the store, my entire office was destroyed. This time the river took that retaining wall.'' The flood caused about $120,000 in damage and clean-up costs, but perhaps the biggest blow was the disabling of her computer under three feet of water. ''I ran my whole business on that computer -- all my financial data, inventory, vendor bills, my marketing materials, customer lists, menus,'' she said. ''I was even working on a Web site and had all the photos I had taken on there.'' It wasn't as if she hadn't taken defensive measures. She had backed up a lot of her financial data, but the backup disk turned out to be defective and she was unable to retrieve the information. Ms. Vitart's adversity is being repeated with increasing frequency across the world of small business, specialists say. Entrepreneurs, who are often short-staffed and consumed by the problems of the moment, have always been a bit haphazard about preparing for unexpected events that could threaten their firms' survival. But the technology revolution that has made them reliant on computers for storing information and running their companies has made vigilance all the more crucial, contends William G. Raisch, executive director of the International Center for Enterprise Preparedness at New York University, which is financed by the Department of Homeland Security. That data can be lost in fires, floods, burglaries, computer malfunctions, virus infections, even terrorist attacks, Mr. Raisch said. ''The reality is that small and medium-sized businesses have less of a capacity to recover from these things because they are generally concentrated in a single site and some disasters can go well beyond their resources,'' he said. Entrepreneurs can hardly be unaware of the dangers. A survey of small-business owners conducted last year by the Gallup Organization for the Research Foundation of the National Federation of Independent Business found that at least 30 percent of respondents had had to shut down for 24 hours or longer in the previous three years as a result of a natural disaster, like a blizzard or hurricane. One in 10 reported hardship from man-made disasters like civil disorders or arson. And more than one-third said they had been victims of computer viruses; of those, 28 percent had lost data, 29 percent had had to buy new equipment and 60 percent had had to hire outside help to fix the problem. The sudden breakdown of a computer system can inflict harm beyond just the loss of data. More and more large companies are asking their suppliers to connect with them electronically for ordering and inventory control, so a disruption of Internet access even for short periods can jeopardize a small business's relationship with clients. What concerns small-business experts is the continuing resistance of so many entrepreneurs to bite the bullet and take action. Consider Ms. Vitart's course of action after the flood nearly destroyed her business. She and her husband shut down the bakery for six weeks, losing an estimated $50,000 in sales, and reopened it the week after Mother's Day only by stretching their credit to the limit and using all their personal savings. ''I feel like I'm starting from scratch,'' she said. The couple made some changes to make it easier to cope with future floods, like paying a carpenter to rebuild the shop's counters in small units to make them easier to remove. In the future, she says, she will evacuate her computer at the first hint of flooding. But she has no plans to hire a disaster recovery consultant or purchase a service to protect her data. Some specialists say she ought to consider some additional steps. Yossi Sheffi, director of the M.I.T. Center for Transportation and Logistics, said small-business owners like Ms. Vitart should at the least make sure their backup disks are functioning by testing them periodically. He also advised business owners to buy firewall protection and antivirus software, and to consider investing in an off-site data backup service. And do not take anything for granted, he advised. After hiring a firm to store data, business owners should contact the company about three weeks into the process and make sure all their information can be easily retrieved. That means having the company either send a disk with the data or give access to the data online. Mr. Raisch of New York University counsels small-business owners to review their important business processes and understand what the business relies on. He suggests reading NFPA 1600, a preparedness standard from the National Fire Protection Association that grew out of an effort by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the early 1990's to create a common backbone for emergency planning. The standard was given a lift in July 2004 when the 9/11 Commission urged its adoption. It offers businesses of all sizes a benchmark and guide for planning everything from protecting employees' safety to identifying natural, human and technological disasters. Copies can be downloaded at NFPA.org. Many small businesses have learned the hard way to take steps to protect the stored information that is their lifeblood. Riza Chase-Gilpin, owner of Kitty's WonderBox, a Wellington, Fla., maker of disposable cat litter boxes, was hit with a computer virus last year when she opened an attachment from an unknown source. The virus shut down her only computer and she was unable to gain access to customer information or to place orders on the electronic data interchange, known as E.D.I. ''We ended up being late on a couple of deliveries because we couldn't do E.D.I.,'' she said. ''I had to call the E.D.I. company I work with and ask them if any orders had come in and then they would fax them to me. We missed a couple of orders as a result and that could have had a huge financial impact.'' Luckily, when she explained the circumstances to her customers, they were sympathetic. Fixing the computer cost Ms. Chase-Gilpin $600, but she bypassed a larger expense because she had all her information, including invoices and purchase orders, on hard copy. She bought a laptop in January so she's not reliant on a single desktop computer, and she added full virus protection on her computers at a cost of $150 annually. Time is also a critical issue for small businesses. Two years ago, sorting through the spam pouring into the e-mail directories at Shustak Jalil & Heller was wasting upward of an hour a day of the partners' time. Given a billing rate of $300 an hour, the wasted time was becoming a financial burden on the law firm, a boutique firm with offices in New York and San Diego. ''In our business, the only thing we have to sell is our time,'' said Irwin Shustak, managing partner. The solution was quick and cheap. Mr. Shustak turned to a consultant, and based on his advice, subscribed to a spam-and-virus filtering service for $500 a year. As a result, he said, ''We've cut down on virtually all of the junk mail.'' SMALL BUSINESS Correction: August 12, 2005, Friday The Small Business article in Business Day yesterday, about procedures to handle technology problems, misspelled the given name of the managing partner at Shustak Jalil & Heller, who discussed the law firm's handling of e-mail spam. He is Erwin Shustak, not Irwin."
"The costly federal effort to rebuild New Orleans's flood defenses in time for next year's hurricane season will leave the city no less vulnerable to major storms than it was to Hurricane Katrina, engineers and other experts say. And it will take years or decades, these experts say, to provide New Orleans and nearby communities with protection against hurricanes stronger than Hurricane Katrina, which was nowhere near the worst-case storm when it arrived. Its winds over the city and Lake Pontchartrain were apparently far below the Category 3 standard that was chosen in 1965 as the storm to defend against. ''It took us 30 years to get to a Category 3 standard,'' Brig. Gen. William T. Grisoli, the deputy commander of Task Force Katrina for the Army Corps of Engineers, said of the defenses in an interview. ''You're not going to be at Category 5 by the next hurricane season.'' Citing the 350 miles of levees in the region, General Grisoli added, ''Put it in perspective: It's not going to happen.'' The corps is now involved in an arduous process to restore the levees to their previous level of protection, beginning with quick patches and ending, if all goes according to schedule, just before next year's hurricane season with the levees restored to their level of strength before the storms hit. Solutions for the longer term are not yet on the drawing boards, but experts have wide-ranging ideas that include strengthening the current levee system, finishing long-planned projects that have limped along because of court fights and tight budgets, and even reshaping the city to recognize that some of its lowest-lying areas might serve as future flood basins in the guise of parks or other undeveloped land. For now, the Corps of Engineers acknowledges that with two months left in this year's hurricane season, New Orleans is without any defense against a major storm. Its patched levees can barely withstand a modest storm surge, and flood walls and the taxed drains and pumps can handle only six inches of rain, as last week's renewed flooding in the Lower Ninth Ward showed. ''We don't have hurricane protection,'' General Grisoli said. Senator Mary L. Landrieu, who is co-sponsor of a $225 billion legislative proposal that includes upgraded flood protection and regional rebuilding, said the job ahead ''goes beyond building a higher wall'' against storm waters. ''As this hurricane season tapers off,'' she said, ''we have to be well on our way to drafting a master plan to create the most sophisticated levee system in the world,'' with many elements working together. ''It's not a local problem -- it's not a regional problem,'' Ms. Landrieu said. Because of the economic importance of the area for energy and commerce, ''It's a national problem, and it's a very expensive problem to fix.'' In the long run, the challenges will only grow. Sea levels are rising around the world, and the land around New Orleans -- including the levees -- is sinking. The Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico have entered a cycle of intensified hurricane activity that could last a decade or two, and two recent studies have found that global warming might already be causing storms to be stronger than they otherwise would be. Craig E. Colten, a professor of geography and anthropology at Louisiana State University, said that what could protect against even a Category 5 storm today ''might not stand up to the worst kind of storm in 50 or 100 years.'' Many experts agree on basic measures that could be taken to prevent further flooding, if Congress opens the purse strings. Alfred Naomi, senior project manager for the New Orleans District of the Corps of Engineers, has studied ways to bring New Orleans up to Category 5 protection and says any defense against such storms would start with barriers in the channels connecting Lake Pontchartrain with the Gulf of Mexico. The gates, which would be shut during storms, would prevent the surging gulf waters from adding to any surge from the lake. This would in turn reduce the amount of water coursing up the drainage canals that carry the pumped runoff out of the city and into the lake. The failure of thin flood walls along those drainage canals caused most of the flooding of central New Orleans. Smaller gates at the mouths of those canals could stop residual surges of floodwater from the lake, Mr. Naomi said. The city's pumping system can be modernized and improved, and levees and floodwalls will have to be made higher. But the added weight would cause them to sink even faster, and added width -- three feet for every vertical foot -- would require costly condemnation of nearby real estate. A Louisiana flood control official said that much could be accomplished for the New Orleans area by completing projects currently on the books and rethinking the regional patchwork of programs. ''Right now we have a piecemeal system,'' said the official, Ed Preau, the assistant secretary for public works with the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development. While the current projects offer protection only to the Category 3 level, Mr. Preau said, they could be strengthened. ''The big issue is going to be to get past the environmental concerns,'' he said, adding that wrangling with environmental groups over big projects has slowed the process. Harold Schoeffler, a local official with the Sierra Club and Audubon Society, called the accusation that projects had been significantly slowed by environmental groups ''a bunch of baloney.'' Environmental groups never tried to block projects like a flood gate for Lake Pontchartrain, Mr. Schoeffler said; they have only demanded that the corps address the environmental impact. Mr. Schoeffler said the Atchafalaya River and its basin, west of the city, could play a much larger role in defense against floods. He noted that the tangled delta of the Atchafalaya naturally protects the region against storm surges, and added that the corps could enhance that protection by dredging deeper channels. ''The deltas are very beneficial,'' he said, ''but you've still got to get the water out.'' Professor Colten of Louisiana State, the author of ''Unnatural Metropolis: Wresting New Orleans from Nature,'' said engineering work must be accompanied by efforts to restore nature's own systems for fighting floods. With the delta sinking, he said, ''The most fundamental activity outside of the city would be to restore the wetlands.'' Like many environmentalists and other experts, he advocates shutting down the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a 40-year-old shipping channel that is lightly used by industry but appears to have served as a superhighway for the Katrina storm surge, contributing to the devastation of levees and flooding in St. Bernard Parish and the Lower Ninth Ward. Robert Bea, a professor of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, said it was important not to rush into an ill-conceived plan. ''Don't just try to throw $200 billion at it,'' said Dr. Bea, who has worked for the corps and who lost his home when Hurricane Betsy struck New Orleans in 1965. ''We really know how to do it better,'' but ''we do need to slow down and think how to do it.'' Professor Bea's ideas include eliminating many of the city's open canals entirely and replacing them with powerful underground drainage and pumping systems. He said he would also like to see barrier islands built in front of major inlets to block storm surges. Thomas L. Jackson, a longtime resident of New Orleans who is vice president in the local offices of DMJM Harris, a large engineering company, said the federal government needed to rethink the way it protects against hurricanes. After the great Mississippi River floods of 1927, Congress gave the Corps of Engineers broad powers and ample financing to do whatever was needed to prevent a similar disaster in New Orleans, including extremely strong riverside levees. By contrast, hurricane protections, which were approved after Hurricane Betsy in 1965, have greater Congressional oversight and control, and projects are subjected to a cost-benefit balancing test. ''Dams are built based on avoiding the catastrophe that would result if they failed, not on a benefit-cost ratio,'' Mr. Jackson said, adding that the same standard should apply equally to hurricane protection systems for New Orleans. William F. Marcuson III, the former director of the Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station in Vicksburg, Miss., and president-elect of the American Society of Civil Engineers, said that even though elected officials have vowed the city would be rebuilt, in the long run it would be foolhardy to redevelop many of the most flood-prone areas. Essentially, he said, those areas want to be bays and wetlands. ''Buy the lots back and let insurance pay for the houses,'' he went on. ''Then maybe make it a golf course or bird sanctuary.'' Recovery after a disaster generally takes far more time than people expect, said Robert W. Kates, emeritus professor of geography at Brown University. Dr. Kates, who has developed a well-regarded four-stage model of disaster recovery, said that the fourth stage -- the one in which greater levels of protection are put in place -- is rarely accomplished because it can take many decades. As the rebuilding proceeds to the final stage of reconstruction, he said, the tensions that arise after every disaster are sure to emerge in New Orleans -- especially the very common conflict between those who insist on putting things back in place quickly and those who say, ''Let's do it right. Let's do it better.'' STORM AND CRISIS: ENGINEERING"
"Since Hurricane Katrina emptied St. Bernard Parish of residents and filled it with water, Henry J. Rodriguez Jr., the canny, profane parish president known to his constituents as Junior, has become a politician without a clear polity, yet with more power and money than ever. Generals stop by his improvised headquarters in a refinery to make sure he has what he needs. Lieutenant colonels wait on his orders, calling him ''Junior'' or ''boss.'' Marines who worked to rebuild the Falluja, Iraq, are applying their lessons here. Officials from the Agency for International Development have come to see where foreign aid should go. Last Monday, President Bush paid him a visit. ''I goosed him,'' Mr. Rodriguez said, raising the rubber-tipped cane he uses to administer this favorite gesture of affection. ''He put his arm around me and said, 'You and I are going to play poker together some day.''' He paused, then added slyly, ''I don't mind getting some of that Texas money.'' Although he appreciates the help, Mr. Rodriguez, 69, is livid over what he considers a glacial response by the state and federal governments, particularly the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Besides the Coast Guard, he said, the first outsiders on the scene were 50 Canadian Mounties from Vancouver. Mr. Rodriguez insists that he no longer uses a particular obscenity, though in fact he does, in various forms. ''I just say, 'Go FEMA yourself.' That's a dirty enough word.'' Mr. Rodriguez estimates that three-fourths of the more than 25,000 houses in the parish may have to be leveled. ''We'll be rebuilding the parish for the next 10 years,'' he said. After a gall bladder operation went awry and then he developed heart trouble, Mr. Rodriguez spent 46 days in intensive care, emerging about a month before the storm hit. He never left the parish. At the government offices with his wife, Evelyn, and some members of the parish council he evaded the water by climbing to an upper floor and then, after a couple of days, escaping in a boat. His own house was submerged. Since then, with his cane and snakeskin belt, he has ruled from the refinery and slept there. With that example, parish workers and contractors who lost almost everything are working hard and bantering hard, though some have a way, if you inquire too deeply into how they are doing, of bursting into tears. ''He was a rock,'' said Capt. David R. Pine of the Shreveport, a 567-foot amphibious assault ship docked on the Mississippi. The Shreveport is serving as a hotel and mess hall for emergency workers, and Captain Pine is dispatching his men to clear debris and perform other tasks. Elected president in 2003 after holding various positions in the parish for almost 30 years, Mr. Rodriguez has white hair, a hawk nose and a throat and a stomach that bulge and sag like a lava flow. He made himself an expert on coastal erosion and, seeking federal help, warned well before Hurricane Katrina of the flooding risks faced by his parish. He also cultivates an image of lechery. Of one female constituent, he asked, ''How's your fine daughter, with the big boobs?'' He has a reputation for making racist remarks. On Friday, before he realized a reporter was in his cluttered, chaotic office, he was heard to use a slur for blacks. He did so in saying that many have the same names, drawing a comparison with the 90 German experts who are helping ''de-water'' the parish, who, he said, are ''all called 'Klaus.''' Marines have been going to every house, closing the main water valve to each so the water company can locate breaks. Mr. Rodriguez just put out a contract worth $122 million to clean the streets of mud. The parish's annual budget is $57 million, and its tax base is gone. ''It's FEMA money,'' he said. Few buildings and even fewer lives here were untouched by the storm. On Saturday, the parish began letting residents return to select neighborhoods to salvage belongings. As Arthur Stearns, 56, helped a daughter take possessions from her house, he described a wall of water that overwhelmed him, his wife and their son when they stayed behind. His son survived, but he was certain that his wife, Marion, drowned. After almost three weeks, he still did not know where her body was. He had not been allowed to check his own house, in an area contaminated by an oil spill. He stopped a passing sheriff's deputy to ask, ''Is all the bodies out of St. Bernard Parish?'' The officer said that search teams had been going door to door. ''She should be out of here by now,'' Mr. Stearns said, almost to himself. ''Who?'' the officer asked. ''My wife,'' Mr. Stearns said. ''I lost my wife.'' At the emergency headquarters on Saturday, Larry J. Ingargiola, director of the parish's office for emergency preparedness, expressed doubts about the safety of letting residents visit so soon. [On Monday, the state ordered a halt to the program, citing the approach of Tropical Storm Rita, according to the parish Web site.] Mr. Ingargiola urged Mr. Rodriguez to call the State Department of Environmental Quality, believing that it would persuade him to suspend the program. The ensuing performance on Mr. Rodriguez's end of the line was a master class in political sumo wrestling. He started out circling, saying of his parish, ''We in pretty good shape, for the shape we in.'' Then he charged. ''What's all this I hear about shutting us down?'' he demanded. ''I see no reason to believe we don't have an excellent re-entry program. Have you seen it? Have you read the document?'' He said the Environmental Protection Agency had informed him that its testing showed the parish not too badly contaminated. He repeatedly mocked the officials for remaining in Baton Rouge. ''Don't take anything personal that I'm telling y'all.'' He finally exploded, saying he wanted to talk to them face to face. With a sweet ''O.K., baby,'' Mr. Rodriguez reached out to hang up. As the handset traveled toward its base, a tinny voice could be heard trying to get in a word from Baton Rouge. For now, Mr. Rodriguez's dispersed constituents would continue to revisit their homes, maybe for the last time. STORM AND CRISIS: POWER BROKER"
"Business owners and some residents slowly returned to parts of this storm-struck city and surrounding communities early Saturday, prying back plywood and stepping over ruined steeples on the first day of a staggered re-entry scheduled to move ZIP code by ZIP code, parish by parish. Carol Winn Crawford, pastor of the 130-year-old Rayne Memorial United Methodist Church on St. Charles Avenue in the Uptown neighborhood, stood in the sanctuary where roof slates rest in the pews. Outside, the brick steeple was reduced to rubble. ''Not this Sunday,'' Ms. Crawford said, when asked how soon services would resume, ''but the next.'' After passing through armed checkpoints, many business owners across the city were seeing their businesses for the first time since Hurricane Katrina struck on Aug. 29, eventually flooding 80 percent of the city and forcing mass evacuations. They arrived in a city with little electricity and mostly undrinkable water, where soldiers did jumping jacks on Napoleon Avenue as a red sun rose. About 1,000 workers from Entergy repaired utility poles and untangled power lines from the fallen limbs of live oaks. Mayor C. Ray Nagin has ordered a dusk-to-dawn curfew indefinitely. Vice Adm. Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard, who is in charge of the federal recovery effort, urged residents to stay away from New Orleans for the time being. The Associated Press reported on Saturday night that Admiral Allen had expressed concerns about plans to allow residents to return to the city, and that he would discuss those concerns with Mayor Nagin in a meeting on Monday. President Bush, who has faced sharp criticism for the federal response to the storm, pledged in his Saturday radio address to support the Gulf Coast in ''one of the largest reconstruction efforts the world has ever seen.'' A few businesses promised to reopen almost immediately. Others, crippled from storm damage or vandalism and looting, needed time to clean and make repairs. Most were on higher ground in a city where much of the land is below sea level. Several said they were relieved that the damage was limited, all things considered. And for some people who never left the city, the return of the business owners meant more than just a neighborly reunion. ''I've got like two gallons of water left, so I hope people come back soon and open something up,'' said Bill Roach, 48, standing outside his second-floor room in an apartment house near the corner of Magazine and Jena Streets in the Uptown area. Mr. Roach, pointing to the light traffic coming up Magazine, said he had expected more of a morning rush into town. ''I'm surprised they're not lining the streets right now,'' he said. Business owners are being allowed to return this weekend to four areas: Uptown, the French Quarter, the central business district and, across the Mississippi River, the neighborhood of Algiers. Before the storm, Orleans Parish, which has the same boundaries as the city of New Orleans, had 10,460 establishments with 208,288 employees and an annual payroll of $7 billion, according to a 2003 breakdown by the Census Bureau, the most recent available. Residents are expected to be able to return to the same four areas on a staggered basis over the next week, beginning with Algiers on Monday and ending with the French Quarter the next Monday. But many residents have been unclear on the schedule, and some began returning on Saturday. The reopening could eventually bring as many as 200,000 people back to a city whose population was about 445,000 before the storm. There are no plans to re-open the most heavily damaged areas, some of which remain under floodwaters. On Friday, the city released re-entry guidelines it planned to distribute at two primary entry points, the intersection of Interstate 10 East at the Pontchartrain Expressway and the West Bank Expressway into Algiers. Among the warnings: ''You are entering at your own risk. The City of New Orleans remains a hazardous site, and ongoing health and safety issues are being assessed.'' ''You may not be outside between 6 p.m. and 8 a.m., either in a vehicle or on foot. This will be strictly enforced. Keep personal identification with you at all times.'' ''Police and fire services are limited. The 911 system is not fully functional at this time.'' Mayor Nagin has said he has been criticized for not reopening parts of the city sooner. Others say it remains far from ready for residents. Admiral Allen warned of health risks from floodwaters, sludge and tap water. ''We will continue to work with local and state leaders to support the shared goal of allowing residents to eventually return in a safe and sustainable manner,'' Admiral Allen said in a statement. ''I urge all residents returning to use extreme caution if they return and to consider delaying their return until safer and more livable conditions are established.'' In Algiers on Saturday morning, Serge and Mai Chatain found their business intact after driving all night from Houston to check on it. They own a nail salon, Anna's Nails, off of Gen. Charles de Gaulle Highway. ''We open the door, and the phone rings,'' Mr. Chatain said. They agreed to meet the caller, a drugstore owner, at 4 p.m. ''They need nails,'' Mrs. Chatain said. ''They have horrible nails.'' Not everyone could get back to business so quickly. Liem Vu, the owner of Newton's Discount Market in Algiers, found his store broken into and the shelves bare. Anything portable was stolen. ''Even the meat slicer, the microwave, the TV for the security camera,'' Mr. Vu said. Mr. Vu said he sympathized with the looters, to a degree. ''Food, O.K.,'' he said. ''People went a little bit too far.'' Areas outside the city also allowed re-entry on Saturday. Jefferson Parish, west of the city, had already allowed business owners to return and planned to allow full residential access beginning on Sunday. In St. Bernard Parish, where floodwaters had risen to 20 feet and the Murphy Oil refinery had spilled thousands of barrels, parts of the Arabi and Chalmette neighborhoods were opened at dawn for residents to take stock of their ruined homes. In New Orleans, Gwen and John Deakle returned from their farm in Lumberton, Miss., to the elegant five-bedroom house they own on Royal Street in the French Quarter. They had been warned of damage behind the iron gates leading to the back patio, but not of the extent. A third-floor wall of Antoine's, a 19th-century French-Creole restaurant next door, had collapsed in their courtyard. Although the power was out and the ferns had withered on the balcony, a flashlight-tour of the interior found the antiques intact behind the shuttered windows. ''Like everybody says, it could have been worse,'' Ms. Deakle said. Despite concerns about the re-entry process, people reported few lines or complications, in part because the number of people returning seemed relatively small. One soldier on St. Charles, a major cross-town thoroughfare, said late Saturday afternoon that he had counted only about six cars an hour passing his checkpoint, but that another, on South Claiborne Avenue, had counted 100 cars an hour. Some people returning were surprised that, except for Algiers, most of the newly opened areas still lacked power. A spokeswoman for Entergy, Amy Stallings, said several obstacles were causing delays, including a door-by-door check for gas leaks in the French Quarter and water in office building basements, which often house electrical vaults. The company will not restore power to areas where underground power lines are flooded, perhaps because of broken water mains. ''It's gaining water while we're pumping water, and we're not really sure where it's coming from,'' Ms. Stallings said. Ms. Stallings said the company hoped to have power restored to the French Quarter and the central business district by Friday and to Uptown by the next Monday. The heat that has helped the city dry out in many areas has also stewed rotting garbage. Even as signs of life returned to the pungent streets, the environment was hardly ideal for commerce. The doors of the historic Napoleon House bar on Chartres Street remained closed. Across town, on South Carrollton Avenue, the Camellia Grill had boards in the windows. And Domilise's, the unpretentious po'-boy sandwich institution on Annunciation Street in Uptown, was silent, its broken sign blocking the front door. At K-Paul's Louisiana Kitchen in the French Quarter, the chef, Paul Prudhomme, has instructed his staff members to reopen ''as soon as possible,'' said L. Carl Crowder, vice president for operations of the celebrity chef's restaurant. The 235-seat restaurant regained power by late morning, but major obstacles remained before it could reopen, said Joel Poole, the human resources manager. He said he had yet to hear from about half of the 30 people who work in the kitchen, many of whom lost homes and are living in shelters. ''Our big need,'' Mr. Poole said, noting the human flight from the city, ''is going to be people.'' STORM AND CRISIS: THE OVERVIEW"
"Hurricanes come in two waves. First comes the rainstorm, and then comes what the historian John Barry calls the ''human storm'' -- the recriminations, the political conflict and the battle over compensation. Floods wash away the surface of society, the settled way things have been done. They expose the underlying power structures, the injustices, the patterns of corruption and the unacknowledged inequalities. When you look back over the meteorological turbulence in this nation's history, it's striking how often political turbulence followed. In 1889 in Pennsylvania, a great flood washed away much of Johnstown. The water's crushing destruction sounded to one person like a ''lot of horses grinding oats.'' Witnesses watched hundreds of people trapped on a burning bridge, forced to choose between burning to death or throwing themselves into the churning waters to drown. The flood was so abnormal that the country seemed to have trouble grasping what had happened. The national media were filled with wild exaggerations and fabrications: stories of rivers dammed with corpses, of children who died while playing ring-around-the-rosy and who were found with their hands still clasped and with smiles still on their faces. Prejudices were let loose. Hungarians then were akin to today's illegal Mexican immigrants -- hard-working people who took jobs no one else wanted. Newspapers carried accounts of gangs of Hungarian men cutting off dead women's fingers to steal their rings. ''Drunken Hungarians, Dancing, Singing, Cursing and Fighting Amid the Ruins'' a New York Herald headline blared. Then, as David McCullough notes in ''The Johnstown Flood,'' public fury turned on the Pittsburgh millionaires whose club's fishing pond had emptied on the town. The Chicago Herald depicted the millionaires as Roman aristocrats, seeking pleasure while the poor died like beasts in the Coliseum. Even before the flood, public resentment was building against the newly rich industrialists. Protests were growing against the trusts, against industrialization and against the new concentrations of wealth. The Johnstown flood crystallized popular anger, for the fishing club was indeed partly to blame. Public reaction to the disaster helped set the stage for the progressive movement and the trust-busting that was to come. In 1900, another great storm hit the U.S., killing over 6,000 people in Galveston, Tex. The storm exposed racial animosities, for this time stories (equally false) swept through the press accusing blacks of cutting off the fingers of corpses to steal wedding rings. The devastation ended Galveston's chance to beat out Houston as Texas' leading port. Then in 1927, the great Mississippi flood rumbled down upon New Orleans. As Barry writes in his account, ''Rising Tide,'' the disaster ripped the veil off the genteel, feudal relations between whites and blacks, and revealed the festering iniquities. Blacks were rounded up into work camps and held by armed guards. They were prevented from leaving as the waters rose. A steamer, the Capitol, played ''Bye Bye Blackbird'' as it sailed away. The racist violence that followed the floods helped persuade many blacks to move north. Civic leaders intentionally flooded poor and middle-class areas to ease the water's pressure on the city, and then reneged on promises to compensate those whose homes were destroyed. That helped fuel the populist anger that led to Huey Long's success. Across the country people demanded that the federal government get involved in disaster relief, helping to set the stage for the New Deal. The local civic elite turned insular and reactionary, and New Orleans never really recovered its preflood vibrancy. We'd like to think that the stories of hurricanes and floods are always stories of people rallying together to give aid and comfort. And, indeed, each of America's great floods has prompted a popular response both generous and inspiring. But floods are also civic examinations. Amid all the stories that recur with every disaster -- tales of sudden death and miraculous survival, the displacement and the disease -- there is also the testing. Civic arrangements work or they fail. Leaders are found worthy or wanting. What's happening in New Orleans and Mississippi today is a human tragedy. But take a close look at the people you see wandering, devastated, around New Orleans: they are predominantly black and poor. The political disturbances are still to come.

"Why is New Orleans in so much worse shape today than New York City was after the attacks on Sept. 11? The short answer is that New York was attacked by fire, not water. But then why are urbanites so much better prepared to cope with fire than with flooding? Mostly because they learned to fight fire without any help from the Army Corps of Engineers or the Federal Emergency Management Agency. For most of history, fire was far more feared than flooding. Cities repeatedly burned to the ground. Those catastrophes occurred sporadically enough that politicians must have been tempted to skimp on fire protection -- like levee maintenance, it was a long-term investment against a calamity that probably wouldn't occur before they left office. But urbanites learned to protect themselves through two innovations Benjamin Franklin introduced to America. He started a fire department in Philadelphia, as well as its first fire insurance company. Other cities followed, often with the firefighters organized by insurance companies with a vested interest in encouraging public safety. Their customers had a vested interest, too, because they had to pay higher premiums if they lived in homes or neighborhoods that were prone to fire. As fire insurance became a standard requirement for homeowners, they and their insurance companies kept pressure on politicians to finance firefighting and tighten building codes. As a result, the risk of a fire leveling a city like New York is lower than ever. Although the number of fires has dropped so much that experts routinely advise cities to close firehouses, voters' fondness for the stations makes local politicians loath to close any. But as we've learned this week, few people seem to care passionately about maintaining levees or preparing for a predictable flood. They've left that to Washington, which promised to hold back the waters and absolved coastal dwellers from worrying about hurricanes. Starting in the 1960's, the federal government took over the business of insuring against floods. It offered subsidized insurance to people in flood-prone areas, encouraging seaside homes that never would have been built otherwise. Even at bargain rates, most people went without flood insurance -- only about a third of the homes in New Orleans carried it. People don't bother to protect themselves because they figure -- correctly -- that if disaster strikes they'll be reimbursed anyway by FEMA. It gives out money so freely that it has grown into one of the great vote-buying tools of the modern presidency. Bill Clinton set a record for declaring disasters, and then President Bush set the single-state spending record in Florida before last year's election. Now it's New Orleans's turn. Since Washington didn't keep its promise to protect the city, the federal government should repair the damage and pay for a new flood-control system. But New Orleans and other coastal cities will never be safe if they go on relying on Washington for protection. Members of Congress will always have higher priorities than paying for levees in someone else's state. The federal government has a role in coordinating flood control among states and in organizing outside disaster relief, but the locals should fight floods much the same way they fight fires. Fifteenth-century Dutch burghers didn't have the financial or technological resources of today's Louisianians, but they managed to hold back the sea without the Army Corps of Engineers. Here's the bargain I'd offer New Orleans: the feds will spend the billions for your new levees, but then you're on your own. You and others along the coast have to buy flood insurance the same way we all buy fire insurance -- from private companies that have more at stake than do Washington bureaucrats. Private flood insurance has come to seem quaint in America, but in Britain it's the norm. If Americans paid premiums for living in risky areas, they'd think twice about building oceanfront villas. Voters and insurance companies would put pressure on local politicians to take care of the levees, prepare for the worst -- and stop waiting for that bumbling white knight from Washington.

"Pam Stegner knows a lot about preparing for an emergency. After all, Mrs. Stegner, a former emergency medical technician in Collins, Mo., has been stockpiling for years now. To take care of her family of five during a catastrophe, she has a gravity-fed water purifier able to process 30 gallons of water a day, as well as 600 pounds of rice and beans, 18,000 dried eggs and 16 tons of organically grown hard winter wheat stored in a semi-tractor trailer and a temperature-controlled storehouse. Mrs. Stegner is the first to admit that she may take preparedness to an extreme, but her reasons for doing it may not sound so odd after watching victims of Hurricane Katrina languish for days without aid. ''You can't wait for the government to get there,'' she said. ''You will die before they get there.'' Indeed, the Federal Emergency Management Agency advises that Americans prepare a two-week supply cache because it could take that long for help to arrive. FEMA says on its Web site, ''A two-week supply can relieve a great deal of inconvenience and uncertainty until services are restored.'' Getting ready for the next disaster doesn't seem so crazy anymore. Mrs. Stegner, who is the host of a radio show on preparedness and sells survival products from a store in nearby Humansville, says it has been easy to ''get labeled a nutcase'' for worrying about catastrophes. But she and other survivalist outfitters are noticing how, at least right now, the general public is a bit more receptive. John Maniatty, who runs the FrugalSquirrels.com Web site out of Morrisville, Vt., says he is getting six times the traffic he had in early August and considerably more than after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. ''So many more normal people -- I use that term because I get wackos, too -- are taking a look,'' he said. You don't have to go as far as a survivalist, but you can certainly learn from them. Here is a distillation of advice from emergency preparedness experts from across the spectrum: WATER. If you take nothing else away from this article, at least heed this advice: stock up on water. It is cheap, it has a long shelf-life, and, most important, you cannot live without it. Most of us can do without food -- not to mention e-mail and ''Desperate Housewives'' -- for several weeks. But dehydration is a very real and life-threatening danger after a calamity. Though you drink half a gallon of water a day, you should store one gallon of water per person per day. Assume you will be cut off for at least three days and store as much extra as you have room for in a cool, dark space. The International Bottled Water Association says jugs of water can be kept indefinitely, though they may pick up an off-flavor from the plastic after a year or so. But it is pretty easy to rotate the stock every couple of months since many people drink bottled water. If you have the room, store some of the water in the freezer. When the electricity goes, you'll have more ice to preserve the food in the refrigerator for a day or two longer. If worse comes to worse and you run out of water while your community's water supply is contaminated, turn off the water supply to your house and drain water from your water heater or scoop it from the toilet tank. It must be purified by boiling it for several minutes or by mixing in two drops of old-fashioned bleach -- not the ''mountain fresh'' scented varieties -- to each quart of water. FOOD. The odds of anything calamitous happening are slim, so you don't want to spend several thousand dollars buying and storing food. You have better things to do with your money than investing in creamed corn and sardines. If you have a pantry or basement with a decent supply of canned foods and bottled juices, you should do just fine for several weeks. ''You could survive for two weeks just on Tang,'' said Eric Zaltas, nutritionist with PowerBar Inc., a maker of nutrition bars. Given that in most emergencies -- floods, earthquake or fire -- you may have to flee, it is smart to keep a 72-hour bug-out kit. That's a three-day supply that you can easily carry out to the car at a moment's notice. The crucial concept here is high nutrition in a small amount of space. Freeze-dried foods would be perfect, except you'll need clean and heated water to reconstitute those products. Some people buy the military's Meals Ready to Eat. A case of 12 meals costs about $73 and they are currently in short supply. Nutrition bars are another good choice. The rap against them -- loads of fat, carbohydrates and calories -- is actually a plus during a disaster. Something like the PowerBar Performance Bar also contains electrolytes, which when taken with water, will help keep your body chemistry in order. Avoid the chocolate-coated varieties because they will just get messy when it gets hot and water for cleanup is at a premium. High-protein diet shakes are a bit expensive, but have the added advantage of supplying you with liquid, as would high-fiber potassium-packed vegetable juice. Throw in some dried fruit and you have enough calories to get by for three days. Don't forget ready-to-feed baby formula if you have an infant. People with medical conditions like diabetes or kidney disease will have to pay more attention to what they store and what they eat. As for pets, buy the dried pet food your pets don't really like and they won't eat as much. For the truly serious food hoarder, FrugalSquirrels.com, the survivalist outfitter, sells an $18 software package called Food Storage Planner that will compute exactly how much you need and alert you when to replace it. CASH. If you get a warning, head to the nearest cash machine ASAP. (You'll already have all the food and water you need, right?) The time to raid the A.T.M. is before the disaster because when the electricity fails, you won't find one that works. Take out as much as you can because you may need it to buy supplies at post-disaster inflated prices and credit cards won't work if there is no electricity or computer networks are down. When the disaster has passed put the money back in the bank. COMMUNICATIONS. In almost every disaster, cellphones have proved remarkably useless. (Old-fashioned landline phones hold up much better.) Without electricity, desktop computers become expensive paperweights and laptops follow in short order as their batteries drain. Short of a $1,000 satellite phone, there is precious little you can do to reach out to the world in an emergency. Face it. When a disaster strikes, you can't think like Steven P. Jobs. Abraham Lincoln must be your role model because when the electricity goes, all you have at your disposal are the things people of the 19th century got by on. Two things that might help: get an e-mail account from Google or Yahoo that allows you access to e-mail from any computer you happen to find and buy a hand-crank cellphone charger. EXTRAS. You cannot do without a first-aid kit, a radio and lots of batteries. The new flashlights that use light-emitting diodes will help you conserve juice. Camping gear -- butane stoves, coolers and lightweight tents -- easily doubles as survival gear. What else? An adapter that turns your car's cigarette lighter into an electrical outlet for any appliance could be a lifesaver. Consider sticking a can of fluorescent spray paint among your other supplies and then stash all this stuff in a plastic box that can serve to float things out to safety. MEDICINES. Thanks to health insurance companies' rules, it is often not easy to get extra medicine without paying full price. But with a little planning it can be done. Ask your doctor for help. Or for several months in a row, start refilling prescriptions a week or so before they run out until you have accumulated several weeks' supply. DOCUMENTS. Pulling together documents you need on the run may be the hardest thing to do. Financial planners have been after people for years to make a ''beneficiary book'' to help their heirs or executors more easily sort through affairs. It should hold copies of birth and marriage certificates, adoption papers, key identification numbers, copies of bank statements, deeds, titles, credit cards and insurance policies as well as passwords to online accounts. The same information would be useful to you in case you lose access to your primary records in a disaster. Just keep it in a secure place and grab it on the way out of the house. GUNS. Some survivalists recommend a gun for protection. But if you haven't used one regularly, don't know how to store it safely and haven't made the moral decision that you could kill a person, forget it. Someone is just going to get hurt and it will probably be you. Your best protection is banding together with neighbors -- and sharing that food all of you stashed.

"The water rose even after the rains thinned and the winds lightened. It pushed up from the Gulf of Mexico through coastal canals, dismissed the banks of the Calcasieu River in places and surged across Shell Beach Drive to the steps of the estates overlooking the refineries and casinos on Lake Charles. Here near the Louisiana-Texas border, a region where historical high-water marks are recounted with hand gestures at the knee and the neck and with ominous swipes at the air above, Hurricane Rita left its own mark, and new mysteries. What, who was lost beneath the water? Was it still rising, or was it finally falling? ''It's hard to tell,'' John Butterick, a planner with the Calcasieu Parish office of emergency preparedness, said at midday Saturday. ''We don't know if it's just wind moving it around or accumulation.'' By late afternoon it was still unclear. The water appeared to recede in some places but not others, and not before it had swamped neighborhoods, lifted dozens of boats and barges onto riverbanks and flooded the longest memories. ''Audrey didn't do that,'' said David French, a deputy with the Cameron Parish Sheriff's Office, who was stopped in his patrol truck on Highway 27, southwest of Lake Charles, where downed trees and rising water prevented him from checking on the handful of people who refused to evacuate the bayou hamlet of Hackberry. Hurricane Audrey stormed ashore in 1957, killing at least 390 people in what the National Hurricane Center has long called the most destructive storm to hit southwestern Louisiana. Like Hurricane Rita, it took aim at the Texas-Louisiana border, bringing winds as high as 105 miles an hour to Lake Charles, more than 30 miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico in Calcasieu Parish. On Saturday, winds in Lake Charles reached at least 100 m.p.h., Mayor Randy Roach said. This time, however, with the despair of Hurricane Katrina freshly etched, most people got out. Getting back in was another matter. ''Those are our homes down there,'' Deputy French said. ''That's where we live, and we can't get back in.'' A day earlier, Robert Noland, 54, who lives in a house on Shell Beach Drive overlooking Lake Charles, boasted that he did not fear the storm or the rising water, that he remembered Hurricane Audrey and that his house would stay dry. On Saturday his outlook was different. ''I've never seen it like this,'' he said. Not far from Mr. Noland's boathouse, a man spent the night aboard his 18-foot sailboat moored in Lake Charles. ''He said he's fine,'' Mr. Noland said, after driving a small boat through the lake to check on the man Saturday morning. But the water seemed to still be rising, edging over the road to Mr. Noland's driveway and pressuring the man's boat at its anchor. ''He just said to keep checking on him,'' Mr. Noland said. Parts of some low-lying neighborhoods in South Lake Charles were flooded. Roofs were missing from homes and businesses. Power failures were widespread in the city, with utility poles and live oaks leveled across downtown and residential streets and traffic lights often lying in the street. The Civic Center, a shelter for evacuees from Hurricane Katrina until just days earlier, lost part of its roof, and water from the lake filled half its parking lot. Green glass was blown out of the façade of the Hibernia bank building. Some mobile homes were destroyed. Aluminum sheeting flew past rattled horses that galloped endless laps in their pastures. The Interstate 10 bridge over the Calcasieu River was closed to traffic late in the morning for inspections after a barge hit it. Interstate 210, which loops Lake Charles on the south side, was open, despite reports that a tornado may have struck it. It was unclear how many people had been trapped by high water in the coastal parishes bordering Texas. Cameron Parish, geographically one of the largest in Louisiana, has a population of only about 9,000, and nearly everyone had evacuated by late Friday. And officials estimated that about 95 percent of the approximately 200,000 people in Calcasieu Parish, which includes Lake Charles, had evacuated. In Calcasieu Parish, Mr. Butterick said he was aware of at least some people trapped on roofs in the town of Westlake. Water neared the first-floor apartment door of Lynn Cormicle on Prien Lake Road in Lake Charles, but then seemed to stabilize for a few hours. ''Is it going down?'' he asked a stranger. Fears were greater in Cameron Parish, a low-lying area of wetlands, fish camps and farms, where as many as a few dozen people were believed trapped by the water that blocked Highway 27 into Hackberry. State wildlife and fisheries officers arrived late in the day, cutting through trees and hauling johnboats and airboats. Tugboat captains who rode out the storm on their boats apparently were safe. But several people worried about members of the Little family who had stayed to watch over about 500 beef cattle they had corralled to higher ground. Butch Little and his brother, Ernie, both in their 60's, remembered what fields were dry after Hurricane Audrey and steered their herd there. The men had been unable to round up more than 200 cattle grazing farther south near the gulf. ''They may not be there tomorrow,'' Todd Little, Ernie Little's son, said as rain began to rake across his land on Friday afternoon. After the storm, as night began to fall on Saturday, one man, waiting with several others as the wildlife officers took boats into the bayou, said he spoke to the Littles by cellphone at 1 a.m. on Saturday and that they were safe. A woman, Jennifer Buford, said a friend had spoken to Todd Little by cellphone at dawn, ''and the water was up to their necks.'' Another man from Hackberry, Mark Trahan, worried about Todd Little's younger brother, Tim, who had been herding cattle in Johnson Bayou, right on the Gulf, as the storm approached. A call to Butch Little's cellphone was met with an automated message, ''All circuits are busy now. Please try your call again later.'' At nearly 8 p.m., as the water finally began to recede from the edge of the road, Deputy French appeared again on Highway 27. He had news of why rescue workers had not returned with the Littles or others who had decided not to evacuate. ''The people there said, 'We've already made it. We want to go ahead and stay,''' he said. STORM AND CRISIS: LOUISIANA"
"I CALLED my home in New Orleans Wednesday to listen to the phone ring. I didn't call for messages, knowing that without power the answering machine had not taken any. I called to connect to my home. No neighbors remained to talk to. The few who had remained through the storm and through the first part of the week had finally gone. Listening to the ring, imagining it echoing through the silent house, its sound waves caressing so much that I loved and so much of my life, I was reluctant to hang up. It seemed as if hanging up meant abandoning my home and my city, as if I were holding onto it, and hanging up meant letting it all go. What we are seeing is well beyond the worst natural disaster in American history. We will never know the exact death toll, the direct monetary loss will easily exceed that of any other disaster, and the entire population of the New Orleans metropolitan area and much of the Gulf Coast will soon be scattered across much of the country. We may also be seeing the virtual destruction of one of the world's great cities as well. In a way, though, that seems the least of the thing, and less important each day. The initial inability of local or national government to respond, our own impotence and rage over events, and the worst of it, the rapid descent into chaos -- more like Baghdad or Mogadishu than an American city -- each one of these things may be more disturbing than the heart-song of the loss. How did it come to this, and where does it go? Geology and economics answer part of the first question. All the land in the Mississippi River's flood plain from Cape Girardeau, Mo., to the Gulf of Mexico -- more land than Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Vermont combined -- was created by the deposit of sediment by the river. New Orleans itself was located at a point particularly conducive to commerce, and the first areas settled were relatively high ground (and remain dry today). Levees, which go back to the Tigris and Euphrates, had long been in use to control floods, and also helped guarantee a shipping channel; until 1928 virtually all federal money for levees was justified by the river's role in interstate commerce. This effort was, in effect, to channel the river, and it has largely succeeded. Levees have contained all floods on the lower Mississippi -- which routinely carries triple the amount of water in the river at St. Louis -- since 1927. Then canals and pipelines were cut through the marsh below New Orleans to make shipping and energy production more efficient. New Orleans benefited from all this, but not as much as Midwest agriculture exporters or steel importers, which enjoyed cheaper freight, or the entire nation, which enjoyed the oil and gas pumped out of the gulf. But only south Louisiana has suffered from the trade-offs. No floods meant that the river no longer replenished the land each year with silt, so south Louisiana parishes began to sink. And the canals cutting through the marsh accelerated erosion. The result: the equivalent of the island of Manhattan disappears every 10 months. That explains the physical vulnerability of south Louisiana today. It does not answer the most disturbing question: How has New Orleans come so close to collapse? For what we are witnessing bears no resemblance to what has happened in the past. Before this, the flood on the Mississippi River in 1927 was doubtless the most terrible American disaster. In one obvious way, it eerily foreshadowed today's. For one thing, New Orleans officials loudly warned that a disaster was waiting to happen, and condemned Washington for ignoring them, just as last week's devastation was widely predicted. The scope of the 1927 devastation also resembled today's. No one knows the death toll. The official government figures said 500, but one disaster expert said more than 1,000 in Mississippi alone. The homes of roughly one million people, nearly 1 percent of the entire population of the country, were flooded. The Red Cross fed 667,000 people for months, some for a year; 325,000 lived in tents, some sharing an eight-foot-wide levee crown with cattle, hogs and mules, with the river on one side and the flood on the other. Even amid that horror, as in other natural disasters, people responded by bonding together. Goodness emerged. The fault lines of race and class melted away with the levees, and the commonality of the burden that victims shared created a sense of common humanity. But as days dragged into weeks, honor and money collided, white and black collided, regional and national power structures collided. The collisions cracked open the fault lines and caused America to stagger and shift as well. As a result, Americans rethought the responsibility the federal government had toward individual citizens. The government had felt little such responsibility. In 1905, a yellow fever epidemic struck New Orleans. Scientists knew how to fight yellow fever, and the Army had completely eliminated the disease from Havana. Yet, before the Public Health Service would come to New Orleans to save the lives of Americans, the city had to raise $250,000, in advance, to cover the expenses. Americans accepted this. But in 1927, even after the expansion of government during the Progressive Era and World War I, not a single federal dollar went to feed, clothe or shelter any of the 667,000 being fed by the Red Cross. (Indeed, the Army even demanded reimbursement from the Red Cross for use of its field kitchens and tents.) Americans did not accept this. Overwhelmingly they expressed a new belief that the government should help the flood victims and, by implication, other individuals in distress through no fault of their own. This represented an enormous shift in public attitudes. The flood left other legacies almost as significant. It sent hundreds of thousands of blacks out of the flooded territory to Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles. Enormous positive publicity created the presidential candidacy and guaranteed the election of Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, who had been in charge of the rescue effort. Yet his subsequent betrayal of the national African-American leadership and African-American refugees snapped the emotional bond black voters felt for the G.O.P., the party that freed the slaves, beginning the shift to the Democratic Party. The flood also left a legacy directly relevant to today. It led to the passage of the 1928 Flood Control Act, which was the most expensive bill Congress had ever passed, exceeded only by the cost of the Civil War and World War I. That same bill set a precedent redefining the relationship between the federal and state governments, and for the first time gave the federal government full responsibility for flood control along the lower Mississippi and many tributaries.Today we face a disaster even greater than the one in 1927, and for all the similarities a single difference between now and not only 1927 but the other natural disasters is most striking. That sense of common humanity, of a shared burden, did not dominate the immediate aftermath of Katrina. Why not? It is understandable that when no market or restaurant is open to sell food and water, people break into them to survive. As things escalate, some people go the next step and become looters. Once order begins to break down it is difficult to redraw the line. But how to comprehend the hell, the breakdown of society, the snipers shooting at hospitals, shooting at helicopters trying to evacuate people? Yet perhaps this explains it: This disaster was not a common burden. Many people who stayed in New Orleans chose to. But many, and probably most, of those who remained either paid too little attention to the warnings or would have gotten out if they could. Once the levee gave way things deteriorated instantly. Communications between rescue personnel, between government officials became almost impossible. Things soon became so bad a senior aide to the mayor broke into an Office Depot to commandeer communication and computer equipment to rebuild a command post when water knocked out the original one. The population, without power, had no information from television or radio. Troops are finally taking control of what may never again be called the Big Easy. Midwest farm exports still need cheap freight to compete in the world market, and the nation still needs the oil and gas from the gulf; moving that infrastructure and building new refineries would cost billions and take years. If -- a major if -- the existing plan to reverse the coastal erosion will work, then it and the cost of protecting the city against hurricanes may well pass even a cost-benefit test. But past the question of rebuilding this city, my home, will this disaster leave an imprint like the 1927 flood? Will it cause the world to change the way it engages the environment? Will it cause Americans to think about the role of government and this newly seething underclass? I don't know. On Thursday, I tried to call my house once again, to listen to the phone ring. I could not. The phone no longer works. THE NATION John M.

"THE white people got out. Most of them, anyway. If television and newspaper images can be deemed a statistical sample, it was mostly black people who were left behind. Poor black people, growing more hungry, sick and frightened by the hour as faraway officials counseled patience and warned that rescues take time. What a shocked world saw exposed in New Orleans last week wasn't just a broken levee. It was a cleavage of race and class, at once familiar and startlingly new, laid bare in a setting where they suddenly amounted to matters of life and death. Hydrology joined sociology throughout the story line, from the settling of the flood-prone city, where well-to-do white people lived on the high ground, to its frantic abandonment. The pictures of the suffering vied with reports of marauding, of gunshots fired at rescue vehicles and armed bands taking over the streets. The city of quaint eccentricity -- of King Cakes, Mardi Gras beads and nice neighbors named Tookie -- had taken a Conradian turn. In the middle of the delayed rescue, the New Orleans mayor, C.Ray Nagin, a local boy made good from a poor, black ward, burst into tears of frustration as he denounced slow moving federal officials and called for martial law. Even people who had spent a lifetime studying race and class found themselves slack-jawed. ''This is a pretty graphic illustration of who gets left behind in this society -- in a literal way,'' said Christopher Jencks, a sociologist glued to the televised images from his office at Harvard. Surprised to have found himself surprised, Mr. Jencks took to thinking out loud. ''Maybe it's just an in-the-face version of something I already knew,'' he said. ''All the people who don't get out, or don't have the resources, or don't believe the warning are African-American.'' ''It's not that it's at odds with the way I see American society,'' Mr. Jencks said. ''But it's at odds with the way I want to see American society.'' Last week it was how others saw American society, too, in images beamed across the globe. Were it not for the distinctive outlines of the Superdome, the pictures of hovering rescue helicopters might have carried a Somalian dateline. The Sri Lankan ambassador offered to help raise foreign aid. Anyone who knew New Orleans knew that danger lurked behind the festive front. Let the good times roll, the tourists on Bourbon Street were told. Yet in every season, someone who rolled a few blocks in the wrong direction wound up in the city morgue. Unusually poor ( 27.4 percent below the poverty line in 2000), disproportionately black (over two-thirds), the Big Easy is also disproportionately murderous -- with a rate that was for years among the country's highest. Once one of the most mixed societies, in recent decades, the city has become unusually segregated, and the white middle class is all but gone, moved north across Lake Pontchartrain or west to Jefferson Parish -- home of David Duke, the one-time Klansman who ran for governor in 1991 and won more than half of the state's white vote. Shortly after I arrived in town two decades ago as a fledgling reporter, I was dispatched to cover a cheerleading tryout, and I asked a grinning, half-drunk accountant where he was from, city or suburb. ''White people don't live in New Orleans,'' he answered with a where-have-you-been disdain. For those who loved it, its glories as well as its flaws, last week brought only heartbreak. So much of New Orleans, from its music and its food to its architecture, had shown a rainbow society at its best, even as everyone knew it was more complicated than that. ''New Orleans, first of all, is both in reality and in rhetoric an extraordinarily successful multicultural society,'' said Philip Carter, a developer and retired journalist whose roots in the city extend back more at least four generations. ''But is also a multicultural society riven by race and class, and all this has been exposed by these stormy days. The people of our community are pitted against each other across the barricades of race and class that six months from now may be last remaining levees in New Orleans.'' No one was immune, of course. With 80 percent of the city under water, tragedy swallowed the privilege and poor, and traveled spread across racial lines. But the divides in the city were evident in things as simple as access to a car. The 35 percent of black households that didn't have one, compared with just 15 percent among whites. ''The evacuation plan was really based on people driving out,'' said Craig E. Colten, a geologist at Louisiana State University and an expert on the city's vulnerable topography. ''They didn't have buses. They didn't have trains.'' As if to punctuate the divide, the water especially devastated the Ninth Ward, among city's poorest and lowest lying. ''Out West, there is a saying that water flows to money,'' Mr. Colten said. ''But in New Orleans, water flows away from money. Those with resources who control where the drainage goes have always chosen to live on the high ground. So the people in the low areas were hardest hit.'' Outrage grew as the week wore on, among black politicians who saw the tragedy as a reflection of a broader neglect of American cities, and in the blogosphere. ''The real reason no one is helping is because of the color of these people!'' wrote ''myfan88'' on the Flickr blog. ''This is Hotel Rwanda all over again.'' ''Is this what the pioneers of the civil rights movement fought to achieve, a society where many black people are as trapped and isolated by their poverty as they were by legal segregation laws?'' wrote Mark Naison, director of the urban studies program at Fordham, on another blog. One question that could not be answered last week was whether, put to a similar test, other cities would fracture along the same lines. AT one level, everything about New Orleans appears sui generis, not least its location below sea level. Many New Orleanians don't just accept the jokes about living in a Banana Republic. They spread them. But in a quieter catastrophe, the 1995 heat wave that killed hundreds of Chicagoans, blacks in comparable age groups as whites died at higher rates -- in part because they tended to live in greater social isolation, in depopulated parts of town. As in New Orleans, space intertwined with race. And the violence? Similarly shocking scenes had erupted in Los Angeles in 1992, after the acquittal of white police officers charged with beating a black man, Rodney King. Newark, Detroit, Washington --all burned in the race riots of the 1960's. It was for residents of any major city, watching the mayhem, to feel certain their community would be immune. With months still to go just to pump out the water that covers the city, no one can be sure how the social fault lines will rearrange. But with white flight a defining element of New Orleans in the recent past, there was already the fear in the air this week that the breached levee would leave a separated society further apart. ''Maybe we can build the levees back,'' said Mr. Carter. ''But that sense of extreme division by class and race is going to long survive the physical reconstruction of New Orleans.'' THE NATION: CAST AWAY"
"After more than 20 years of bickering over how to prevent the flooding of Venice, it seemed that Italy had finally made up its mind. In December, the Council of Ministers approved the ''Moses'' project, a system of 79 panels that would lie flat on the floor of the Venetian lagoon in normal seas and swing up on great hinges during extremely high tides to form a protective wall at each of the lagoon's three openings to the sea. The Moses plan seemed to satisfy everyone when it was first proposed in 1981. Environmentalists, who abhorred the idea of anything artificial, were pleased that the dykes would be out of sight most of the time; and the dozens of construction companies who were likely to build it were overjoyed by prospects of the $2.5 billion price tag. But the plan's approval did not stop the flow of other ideas about how to solve the floods; despite the vote, the Council was still encouraging further study and modification. Immediately, a prominent Venetian architect and historian named Antonio Foscari published the first of several articles in Il Gazzettino, proposing a radical modification of the project and creating considerable buzz. Mr. Foscari maintains that his plan would keep Venice dry without running the risk of polluting the lagoon or shutting off the city's access to shipping -- both of which the Moses project is feared likely to do. Mr. Foscari's idea, simply put, is to slice the Venetian lagoon in two. Mr. Foscari lives and works with his wife, who is also an architect, in a 17th-century palazzo on the Grand Canal. He has a 15th-century doge in his family tree -- the one immortalized in the Byron play and Verdi opera ''The Two Foscari.'' A few of his ancestors were staring down from his living room walls recently as he unrolled a large satellite photograph of Venice and spread it flat on a table. From above, Venice looks like a terracotta island enclosed in a shallow blue-green lagoon by the sea. On the east, the eight-mile-long Lido provides the lagoon with a slender barrier against the Adriatic. On the mainland to the west, docks and industrial plants are clustered around Marghera. Mr. Foscari pointed to the three evenly spaced openings in the Lido. ''These are the lungs of the lagoon,'' he said. ''Tides flow in and out twice a day, cleansing each of the lagoon's three basins. The upper basin is the basin of Venice. But there's a problem. You can see what appear to be dark green rivers flowing into the lagoon through the three openings. Those are shipping channels that have been gouged out within the last 20 years. The lagoon is typically shallow, only four or five feet deep. But the shipping channel at the middle opening is for oil tankers. It's 50 feet deep. Enlarging the openings drastically increases the volume and force of the tides, creating a turbulence that stirs up the sediment and flushes it out to sea. Every year, the lagoon loses more than a million cubic meters of sediment. That's what those three grayish blobs are, oozing out of the lagoon and extending far out to sea. Today, the Marghera basin no longer has any lagoon features -- no mudflats, no wetlands, no shoals or sandbars, and certainly no amphibious wildlife. Its floor has been scraped flat. You can see that, too. The Marghera basin is not really a lagoon anymore. It's a lake. The same thing is happening to the basin of Venice, but at a slower pace. There's still time to save it, but not very much.'' And his plan? ''My idea starts with a question: Why spend $2.5 billion closing off three openings to the lagoon when you could prevent Venice from flooding by closing just one, if first you sealed Venice off from the lower lagoon with an easily installed bulkhead. Marghera does not have a flooding problem, so it would remain open to the sea and thus at sea level. The water level at Venice would, at times, be lower.'' Mr. Foscari has even grander ambitions than simply solving the flood problem, however. He envisions returning Venice to its historical place as a lively port city. ''The geopolitical implications of doing this are profound,'' he explained. ''Marghera was built at the beginning of the last century as a port. My grandfather, Piero Foscari, designed it. I still have the plans. But Italy was prevented from expanding eastward after the First World War, so the petrochemical industry was put where the port was meant to go. Now, 80 years later, the chemical plants are seen as an environmental hazard -- they lie in the flight path of planes taking off from Marco Polo airport -- and they are likely to be dismantled soon. Once they are gone, we will be left with a magnificent port infrastructure, eight square miles of it, penetrated by deep canals outfitted with powerful quayside equipment and a network of rails and highways. As the Balkans open up, Venice could become the dominant port in this part of the world, the commercial gateway between East and West.'' But will it happen? Important encouragement has come from the American archeologist Albert Ammerman, who created a furor in Italy three years ago by publishing his calculations that the sea level would rise much faster in the next century than the designers of the Moses project had thought. He warned that the dykes would have to be closed nearly every day for three months a year, shutting off the flushing action of the sea and polluting the lagoon. ''Foscari's basic notion is historically valid,'' Mr. Ammerman said by phone from his office at Colgate University. ''If you look at a 16th-century map of the lagoon, you'll see that it was actually divided into three distinct basins separated by sand bars. It wasn't the dredged-out, 200-square-mile lagoon it is today. Furthermore, it makes much more sense to deal with a scaled-down project. It leaves room for experimentation and adjustment.'' As his plan is discussed in newspaper letters columns and wine bars, Mr. Foscari has been called in for a series of high-level, closed-door meetings on his proposal with the mayor of Venice and other leading decision-makers. He has no official role or vote, but that doesn't seem to bother him. ''Sometimes,'' he said with a smile, ''it is enough just to be right.'' THINK TANK"
"A four-degree rise in water temperature near South America last month provides strong evidence that El Niño, the disruptive influence on global weather, is developing, government weather experts report, but how severe the cycle will become remains uncertain. The update on the periodic shift in ocean conditions was described on Thursday by meteorologists at the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The temperature data, corroborated by a rise in regional precipitation and the displacement of cold-water fish by tropical species in the equatorial Pacific, is consistent with similar changes observed in the early stages of previous Niño episodes, the agency said. For several months, the agency has been predicting that a Niño event was likely this spring. El Niño -- a Spanish reference to the Christ child, since it usually appears in the eastern tropical Pacific around Christmas -- is a marked warming of ocean waters along the Equator near the international date line. When water temperatures rise significantly enough to alter cloud cover, increased rainfall occurs, particularly in the tropical Pacific basin. The weather pattern typically arises every four to five years and can last up to 18 months. In 1997-1998, El Niño conditions were blamed for severe floods in Peru and Ecuador and scorching droughts in Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines. The weather event caused thousands of deaths, displaced millions of people and resulted in billions of dollars in damage worldwide. In the United States, agricultural losses during El Niño of 1997-1998 reached an estimated $2 billion, and property losses topped $2.6 billion, according to data compiled by the atmospheric agency. El Niño is notoriously difficult to predict, but meteorologists have been able to improve their forecasts in recent years, using buoys, satellites and other devices to give real-time atmospheric and oceanic data, along with refined computer models. For the United States, El Niño events typically mean more rain and snow in the southern tier in the winter; the developing pattern will spur Western water managers to capture the extra rain. The Great Plains and Pacific Northwest usually experience warmer weather later in the year, and fewer tropical storm systems develop during the Atlantic hurricane season. Enhanced prediction techniques enable farmers to determine the best sites to plant crops and the most effective techniques for applying fertilizers in the face of abnormal weather conditions. Extended forecasting also enables state emergency management agencies to prepare better for potential damage. ''It's still too early to determine the potential strength of this El Niño or exactly what weather conditions it will bring to the United States,'' said Conrad C. Lautenbacher Jr., a retired Navy vice admiral and under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere. ''But it is likely these warming conditions in the tropical Pacific will continue until early 2003,'' Dr. Lautenbacher said. In Peru, officials have already reported significant effects on their fishing industry, the oceanic and atmospheric agency said, as cold-water anchovies are disappearing near their coast with warm water moving into the region. During 1997-1998, Peru's anchovy industry suffered but eventually rebounded. Some weather experts still doubt that the current warming trend will result outright in an El Niño. The International Research Institute for Climate Prediction, financed in part by the oceanic agency, predicted that while there was an ''enhanced likelihood'' of a localized Niño in the Pacific this spring, ''uncertainty still exists'' as to whether El Niño would develop full-fledged in the next few months. The institute estimates there is a 50 percent chance of El Niño conditions developing by mid-2002."
"THE SILVER LINING The Benefits of Natural Disasters. By Seth R. Reice. Princeton University, $24.95. Fires, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes are devastating but inevitable. In traditional ecology they are considered aberrant and entirely bad. But in ''disturbance ecology,'' as Seth R. Reice describes it in ''The Silver Lining,'' natural disasters are predictable occurrences that bring rejuvenation as well as death. The environment, Reice explains, is in ''perpetual flux,'' and violent natural disturbances are essential for a healthy ecosystem. Wildfires and other types of storms, for example, benefit flora and fauna by clearing tree canopies, letting in sunlight and encouraging plant growth. Flooding clears silt from the gravel beds of rivers, creating new habitats for diverse species and enabling fish to spawn. Reice, a professor of biology and ecology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, contends that controlling disasters, especially predictable ones like spring floods from melting snow, actually results in greater destruction -- flood control techniques produce far more devastating floods when they occur, as they invariably will. Reice is occasionally overly didactic. Nevertheless, his book is engaging, and its message is important: our national parks will never be outdoor museums; nature's nature is change.

"Caught between the Mississippi and the long shoreline of Lake Pontchartrain, this low-lying city has long depended on levees and luck. Now engineers say those are not enough to protect New Orleans, much of it below sea level, from a devastating flood that could threaten it if a storm surge from a powerful hurricane out of the Gulf of Mexico propelled a wall of water into the lake and the city. That event could place vast sections under 20 feet or more of water, engineers and scientists say, with worst-case computer predictions showing death tolls in the tens of thousands with many more people trapped by high water that has no natural drainage outlets. ''There's no way to minimize the amount of devastation that could take place under such circumstances,'' warned Walter S. Maestri, director of emergency management of Jefferson Parish, a suburban region with 455,000 residents on the city's western and southern sides. Perhaps the surest protection is building up the coastal marshes that lie between New Orleans and the sea and that have been eroding at high rates. But restoration will require time, a huge effort and prohibitive sums of money, perhaps $14 billion, according to a study by a panel from federal and state agencies, universities and business. Engineers are considering other ways to protect the heart of the city and provide an island of refuge in the French Quarter and government centers. Though such approaches are less expensive, they come with their own problems. One plan involves walling off an area to keep out water. But where would the wall be built and who would benefit from it? Many residents give little thought to such matters, counting on the knowledge that New Orleans has escaped hurricane disaster in the past. The most nervous people are those paid to worry about such things, like Dr. Joseph N. Suhayda, director of the Louisiana Water Resources Research Institute at Louisiana State University. Like other coastal researchers, he has been using the latest geological and meteorological data to refine computer models of how different storms would damage the city. On a bright spring day with fair skies and no trace of the sultry air that will dominate the weather in the months ahead, Dr. Suhayda and a few colleagues drove city streets 1,000 yards from levees that hold back Lake Pontchartrain. At New York Avenue, near the lakefront campus of the University of New Orleans, the car stopped, and the engineer walked over and unfolded a wood measuring stick to its 25-foot length. He planted one end on the pavement and raised it until it was vertical. The other end poked into the sky well above a corner light pole, but it was still well beneath the level of a concrete wall that rose on top of a grassy slope 100 feet away. ''Behind that,'' Dr. Suhayda said, indicating the wall, ''is a canal that runs into Lake Pontchartrain. Its surface is roughly about the same as the lake's surface.'' In a hypothetical situation projected by his computers, Dr. Suhayda continued, a slow-moving Category 4 hurricane, with winds up to 155 miles an hour, or a Category 5 hurricane with even stronger winds could leave water 30 feet deep on this neighborhood street, which is more than five feet below sea level. Though Category 5 hurricanes are very rare, Camille in 1969 devastated Pass Christian, Miss., just 50 miles east of New Orleans, and killed scores of residents with winds that exceeded 200 miles an hour and a 35-foot storm surge. In most areas vulnerable to hurricanes, the water would drain away quickly. That is not the case here. So city planners and engineers continue to work on ways to improve an evacuation plan for the 1.3 million residents in the metropolitan region and to soften a storm's blow. Most long-term projects intended to blunt a hurricane involve slowing the loss of marshlands. One method calls for additional control gates to let the Mississippi pour sediment-rich water into surrounding lands, a process that would eventually raise or at least maintain their elevation. Other proposals are to rebuild eroded offshore barrier islands, erect a wall of levees across much of the lower delta, plug the dredged containership channel that gives the Gulf of Mexico waters easy access to the vulnerable eastern shore of Lake Pontchartrain and help defend that shore with higher flood gates. Perhaps the most unconventional is the ''community haven'' concept advanced by Dr. Suhayda and others in the belief that radical remedies may be necessary to soften a knockout punch by nature. More theory than an organized campaign, it envisions a two-story-high wall with flood gates at crucial intersections to seal off the southern part of the city from a bend in the river at the French Quarter to another one eight miles west. If the rest of the city flooded, Dr. Suhayda said, the ''island'' between the wall and the river's levees could become a refuge for thousands of residents fleeing their homes, as well as preserving the cultural and government center. But obtaining the money on the scale needed is far tougher than devising plans, especially if some skeptics dismiss the worst-case predictions as scare tactics to help finance university research or for further environmental intrusions on the coast. Researchers, though, say they are not making up the city's potential peril, which arises from geology and history. As tight as a pimento in an olive, most of New Orleans is stuffed between the Mississippi and the lake, and it is settling as fast as the rest of the delta or faster, said Dr. Roy Dokka, a geologist at Louisiana State. Although much agonizing has gone into problems of the river, and its metaphoric temperaments have become part of songs and folklore, it is the 300-square-mile lake that troubles him, Dr. Dokka said. As New Orleans grew as a seaport, petrochemical hub, tourist destination and cultural phenomenon, neighboring marshes were drained and the levee system expanded to keep the water out of new suburbs and industrial parks, hastening the drying that led to sinking, and making a bad situation even worse. A computerized cross-section of the city's topography recently created by L.S.U. scientists and engineers shows a shallow bowl-like profile. On the southern edge along the river, the rim rises about five feet above sea level for most of the French Quarter, a half-mile-wide sloping plain created by the river's natural earthen banks. A flood wall built by the Army Corps of Engineers to hold back a cresting river -- which on normal days moves more than 300,000 cubic feet of water a second past the city at an average depth of 90 feet -- raised the levee to a uniform height of 25 feet above sea level, or 10 feet above the average annual high water surface level of the river, when water can rush by at the rate of one million cubic feet of water, or more, a second. Most of the city north of the French Quarter was reclaimed from a boggy morass. The lowest sections -- residential areas and shops that sit on drained marshland at 5 to 10 feet below sea level -- form a wide band near the lake's southern shore. New Orleans International Airport to the west and industrial complexes and residential areas to the east are at sea level or below it. Spider webs of city canals and wide ditches that measure 185 miles in length feed 22 pumping stations that lift water to a height where it can flow into the lake, over levees built more than a half-century ago that stand 15 to 17 feet above sea level. Water cascading over the levee wall or flooding from swollen marshes at the lake's eastern and western ends is just one part of the nightmare, the experts say. Draining the city after the storm moves away may take weeks, they point out. The city would be trapped inside the levees, steeped in a worsening ''witches' brew'' of pollutants like sewage, landfill waste, chemicals and the bodies of drowned humans and animals. Bourbon Street could remain under 10 feet of water, with water swirling above two-story houses in neighborhoods closer to the lake. Dr. Ivor van Heerden, deputy director of the L.S.U. Hurricane Center, said that in a worst-case situation with incomplete evacuation ''we could have up to 45,000 killed and 400,000 trapped on roofs, with 700,000 evacuees who would now be homeless.'' Dr. van Heerden said it would take at least nine weeks to pump the city dry. Pumping stations, which sometimes fail in heavy seasonal downpours in a city that receives nearly five feet of rain a year, would be inoperative under those conditions for days if not weeks, Dr. van Heerden said. The chemical stew that would be pumped into the lake and surrounding marshes would be an environmental disaster by itself, he added. He said that the cost in human misery might be incalculable but that the bills for insured damages, public works repairs and replacements and the economic effects might total $50 billion. Despite the specter of such losses, it has been difficult to find enough money to build up the protective marshlands, said Jack C. Caldwell, head of the state's Natural Resources Department. Washington has been disinclined to earmark billions to protect the marshland and has resisted appeals from Baton Rouge to share revenues from offshore oil production with the state for that purpose, Mr. Caldwell said. In the meantime, residents take their chances every hurricane season, which starts on June 1. According to his computer models, Dr. Suhayda said, the odds that the city will be hit by a cataclysmic storm in any given year are less than 1 in 100. The American Red Cross is taking the threat seriously. It has declared it no longer will provide hurricane shelters in the New Orleans area, saying that placing staff there in a killer storm will represent too much risk for its employees, volunteers and the general public. Correction: May 6, 2002, Monday An article in Science Times on Tuesday about flood control in New Orleans referred imprecisely to the reliability of the city's pumping stations. While they sometimes fail to keep up with the rain in very heavy downpours, the pumps themselves rarely stop working."
"After devastating floods damaged museums, opera houses and other cultural institutions in Central Europe this summer, the specter of a repetition of the floods that swamped Paris in 1910 has prompted the French government to order measures to safeguard the art collections at the Louvre, the Musée d'Orsay and other Paris museums close to the Seine. The Culture Minister, Jean-Jacques Aillagon, announced this week that he had released $3 million to be spent on moving artworks from vulnerable underground storage rooms to specially adapted warehouses beyond the reach of any major flood. The transfer is expected to begin in early December, initially from the Louvre, the Musée d'Orsay, the Central Union of Decorative Arts and the _cole des Beaux-Arts. ''An overflow of the Seine comparable to that of 1910 has gradually faded from our collective memory,'' Mr. Aillagon told reporters, ''but we cannot ignore the reality of such a risk this winter or in future winters.'' The emergency plan is being coordinated by the Direction of French Museums and the City of Paris, which owns several museums that could be affected by flooding, including the Musée Carnavalet, the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, the Petit Palais and the Musée Cognacq-Jay. The Georges Pompidou Center, which houses France's principal modern art collection, is also preparing for an unexpected rise in groundwater. Although the Seine frequently spills onto riverside highways in the winter, only three times in the 20th century -- in 1910, 1924 and 1955 -- did it reach dangerously high levels. Alarm bells rang here this summer, however, after workers at the Zwinger Palace in the eastern German city of Dresden were forced to rescue hundreds of Renaissance and Baroque paintings just hours before underground storage rooms were flooded by the Elbe River. The nearby Semper Opera was also damaged by rising groundwater. French officials say the plan is not only to remove artworks from basement storage areas, but also for museums to be ready to move objects from first floor galleries to higher floors. They expect to be given 72 hours' warning of a major flood. The transfer of artworks to another location, however, poses particular problems because they are currently kept in temperature-controlled rooms. ''A painting on canvas and a painting on wood cannot be treated in the same way,'' one official at the Louvre noted. ''This is something that has to be prepared very carefully.'' Mr. Aillagon said that the new storage sites had not yet been determined, but that around 170,000 square feet of space would be needed immediately."
"The business of undertaking was never more vital along storm-racked Main Street in this old Appalachian mining town as Jim Widener mucked out the casket display room of his funeral home today. ''We're managing to handle the wake of Shirley Faye Mitchem,'' Mr. Widener said as this remote coal hollow reeled under the devastation of its second deadly flood in 10 months. ''Mrs. Mitchem was killed when the storm took down a tree on Route 52 that smashed into her car,'' said Mr. Widener, who had just finished restoring his funeral home from the effects of the flash flood last July when the second one swept through Main Street last Thursday and deluged his business once more. ''Her husband, Edgar, is still on the critical list,'' added the undertaker, doing his best to clean up the premises so victims could properly grieve over a storm that has swept lives and homes to oblivion in the funnel-like confines of the area's steep creek-side hollows. Rainstorms continue to besiege mountainside dwellers left isolated by flood damage here in McDowell County, in the southernmost reaches of West Virginia. The storm of last week killed six people in the county while destroying close to 200 homes and flooding more than 2,000 others. Five other flood-related deaths have been reported in a multicounty swath of hamlets along the winding Virginia and Kentucky borderlands of Appalachia. ''Last July's storm was called the 100-year flood,'' noted Kimball's mayor, Jack Premo. ''I guess this is a 101-year flood. We lost everything last time, including City Hall, and we've lost it all again with this one.'' The town shuddered anew as Elkhorn Creek once again thickened with a flash storm and roared above its banks down Main Street, bursting the doors of restored businesses. Residents here and in a half-dozen other coal hollows complain that the 100-year flood timetable of folkloric tradition has been dangerously accelerated by modern timber cutters and strip miners on the surrounding steep mountainsides. Industry maintains that its work here is accompanied by restoration efforts ensuring that no environmental damage is permanent. But stunned residents say natural runoffs, and trees that would otherwise help absorb the downpours, have been obliterated, so that flash rains roar down on towns like unimpeded avalanches. ''The logging has been going on indiscriminately, and no one will help us control it,'' said Jean Battlo, a writer whose Main Street home and elaborate flower garden were deluged once more by the latest torrent. ''Even Senator Rockefeller was asking about the timbering,'' Ms. Battlo said of Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, who toured the damage on Monday and asked repeated questions about the effects of timber clear-cutting on the land's ability to absorb and channel runoffs. ''I rebuilt after July's flood; how stupid was that?'' Ms. Battlo said as the town spent another anxious day under flash-flood warnings. ''I've been writing a play about the Hatfield shootouts in the mining days, but I can see the fresh tragedy to be written here is all about the flooding,'' she said, vowing to stay and capture the story. As they shoveled, hosed and mopped, the few Main Street merchants left in this town of 500 residents were vowing to clean up and reopen, if only because they had no alternative way of surviving. ''Everybody down this part of the country is tough,'' said Jimmy Gianato, the hardware dealer descended from Italian immigrant coal miners who settled Kimball when King Coal boomed along the Elkhorn. ''Our parents were tough, our grandparents tougher, and toughest were the old-timers from the old country,'' said Mr. Gianato, a member of this town's stalwart mercantile clan. The Gianato hardware and grocery stores were ruined in the flood last July. At the time, Mayor Premo openly raised the question of closing down the town. The Gianatos and other leaders stayed and reopened last summer, only to be at the mops and shovels this morning. The McDowell County region, one of the poorest in Appalachia, has been in a downward spiral for 50 years, with young people emigrating and welfare replacing coal as an economic force. The county now has only about one-fourth the population of 100,000 it had in busier days, when, long before machine-intensive strip mining, manual labor was at a premium. But retired miners like Mayor Premo, who worked 40 years underground, remain addicted to the beauty of the mountain hollows. So when the flooding returned last week, ''the older people just sat in their houses and cried,'' said Fran Lambert, a resident who pitched in to rescue aged neighbors. ''We couldn't get them to stand up and go to the cars,'' Ms. Lambert said. ''It was hard for all of us to believe that this was happening all over again a year later.'' It may take a week or more to even reach the more remote hollow communities like Avondale and Barton No. 3, disaster officials said. ''It breaks your heart to see a third of the houses in Coalwood gone, destroyed,'' said Jay Wilson, director of McDowell Mission, a Methodist charity. He is hoping for the return of hundreds of volunteers from across Appalachia who helped rebuild impoverished McDowell County hamlets last summer. ''Recovery truly depends on people pulling together,'' said State Senator John R. Unger II, who is coordinating the state disaster-relief effort. ''And I have to marvel how people are doing just that, rising above their homes' being destroyed.'' Residents complain strongly about the effects of lumbering and strip mining, noting in particular the Bush administration's new decision to ease coal waste restrictions on mountaintop mining. This process involves the decapitation of mountaintops by giant machinery that now will have more leeway in pouring wastes into nearby streams that environmentalists say are vital for storm management. A state study on the effects of mining and lumbering on the Appalachian hollows is expected this summer. The Bush administration contends that the new policy on coal waste will be tightly controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers. But Mr. Widener, the undertaker, firmly insisted: ''Timbering and mining have raped and ruined us. A hundred families left after the July flood, and now here's the fresh storm, the ground bursting open with nowhere for the water to go. We're left all scared and hesitant.'' -------------------- Judge Bars Mountaintop Permits CHARLESTON, W.Va., May 8 (AP) -- A federal district judge ordered the Army Corps of Engineers today to stop issuing new permits for mountaintop coal mining. The judge, Charles Haden II, said the Environmental Protection Agency and the corps had overstepped their authority by making recent changes to the definition of the types of materials that could be dumped in nearby waterways by the mining operations. He said only Congress could change the definition. A spokesman for the corps, Steve Wright, said its officials had yet to read the ruling, which stemmed from a suit brought in February by an advocacy group, Kentuckians for the Commonwealth."
"Residents across Illinois, Indiana and Missouri braced for more flooding today as scattered showers continued. Even so, there was hope that sandbags would prevail against overflowing rivers that were already blamed for nine deaths in the past two weeks. The governors of Illinois and Missouri declared states of emergency this week, as did officials in 15 Indiana counties. Missouri was apparently the hardest hit, with eight deaths reported. In asking President Bush to declare 37 counties as disaster areas, Gov. Bob Holden cited the deaths and the loss of millions of dollars in property damage and to local economies. In Illinois, Senator Richard J. Durbin sent a letter to President Bush on Thursday asking him to declare the state a federal disaster area. ''We've got a serious problem facing us here, and I hope we get a response soon,'' Mr. Durbin said late today, adding that he had surveyed flooding downstate a week ago. ''It's gotten progressively worse.'' The flooding has already affected thousands of residents in the region, forcing the evacuation of many and the closure of scores of roads. Across the Midwest today, residents were looking for a rainbow, though all that existed for some on this dreary day was rain. In flood-weary towns, like Crystal City, Mo., about 30 miles south of St. Louis where the Mississippi River has spilled into downtown, the continued rain kept many volunteers stacking sandbags, hopeful that they would keep the water at bay. In Indiana, where Gov. Frank O'Bannon toured the central and southern parts of the state by helicopter this week, rivers and creeks flowed out of their banks. Today, scattered showers across Indiana added to some of the worst flooding the state has seen in at least six years. An above-normal rainfall this spring and heavy showers this month had swelled creeks and rivers. Hundreds of residents were driven from their homes or cut off by water on low-lying roads. Farmers, already behind on planting corn, were expecting more weeks of delays with many fields under water. In the first flood-related death reported outside of Missouri, officials in Bath, Ill., said that Christian Turner, 8, drowned on Thursday after jumping out of a boat that had broken away from a mooring behind his house where he and two other boys were playing. ''He started drifting downstream and kind of panicked a little bit,'' said John Windsor of the Mason County Sheriff's Department. ''The water was only like six feet, and the current, the way it is, it just makes it 10 times more dangerous.'' In Bath, and elsewhere across east central Illinois, volunteers stacked sandbags today, expecting the Illinois River to crest on Monday, officials said. ''It's starting to get a little worse,'' Mr. Windsor said late today. Gov. George H. Ryan of Illinois issued a disaster declaration this week to provide state resources to respond to flooding. Illinois prison inmates filled sandbags at trouble spots, distributing at least 650,000 through today. In Missouri, two storm systems the past two weeks have left the Mississippi swollen, flooding low-lying areas, officials said. The heavy rainfall also raised the Missouri River, causing its tributaries to flood in the western part of the state. John Ogren, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Indianapolis, characterized the current flooding as serious, but not yet reaching the level of 1993 floods that devastated parts of the region. ''If you are being impacted by this flood, it's serious,'' Mr. Ogren said. ''But it doesn't have the same geographical scope as the 1993 floods.'' He added: ''In 1993, we had a lot of snowfall in the winter, so we had the heavy rains fall on top of the snow. This year, we didn't have a lot of snowfall. We started off reasonably dry.'' Mr. Ogren said forecasters predicted above-average rainfall for the Midwest through August. ''We are not out of the woods yet,'' he said. In Missouri, the rain had been expected to end by midday today -- but kept falling. It was forecast to continue through the weekend in parts of Illinois and Indiana. The National Weather Service said that some sections of Indiana could see as much as four more inches of rain and that water levels in the region's rivers would remain high for the next week to 10 days. By this evening, there was some good news in Crystal City, even with State Highway 67 under three feet of water from the Mississippi that fed into the Joachim Creek, spilling over. Officials said the river crested today at 37.2 feet, about 8 feet above flood stage. ''It's about to clear up,'' Karry Friedmeyer, the city's superviser of streets. ''It looks like we're just about to get out of the rain here. Hopefully, the flood waters will be receding here pretty soon.''"
"The flooding that has brought death and devastating property damage to Central and North Texas moved southward today as swollen rivers forced highway closings and prompted evacuations in small towns, while officials kept watch on a new storm front developing in the Gulf of Mexico. In cities that suffered the heaviest damage last week, like New Braunfels in Central Texas and Abilene in North Texas, residents continued salvaging personal possessions today and cleaning up mud-caked homes. Gov. Rick Perry estimated that property damage could reach $1 billion as President Bush declared 11 more counties as federal disaster areas, bringing the total to 24. At least nine people have died in the flooding. The potential for a reprise of the recent devastation seemed less likely in the more sparsely populated counties downriver. The Guadalupe River, which tore homes from their foundations in New Braunfels, is expected to crest on Wednesday in cities like Victoria, though apparently not at levels considered a threat to residents and businesses. Here in Goliad, a town of about 2,000 people that was the site of a famous massacre of Texas soldiers in the state's war of independence from Mexico, residents prepared for a crest of the San Antonio River on Wednesday. Local officials said three highways were closed by high water and 12 houses had already flooded. But they said widespread damage was unlikely because few people lived beside the river and because the small downtown was probably beyond the reach of the high water. Even so, the San Antonio was expected to crest here at higher than 50 feet, double the 25-foot flood stage. ''We were not supposed to get to 40 feet until today,'' said Joyce Williams, a coordinator with the American Red Cross, who was running a shelter for the handful of evacuees in Goliad. ''As of right now, we're at 47.7 feet. It got here a lot faster than we anticipated.'' Forecasters were closely watching a storm in the gulf that could further drench South and Central Texas. But Shawn Bennett, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said today that the front had not yet become a tropical depression and would probably not affect Central Texas. The front was bringing ''beneficial'' rains to the parched Rio Grande Valley, which was not affected by the flooding, Mr. Bennett said. From June 30 through July 6, he said, the Hill Country region of Central Texas received 30 to 35 inches of rain, while in Abilene and Brownwood to the northwest, as much as 15 inches of rain over the weekend caused severe flooding. The deluge in Central Texas in areas like Bandera and New Braunfels was devastating, Mr. Bennett said, because the craggy terrain was particularly vulnerable to flash floods. State officials say as many as 48,000 homes were damaged across an area larger than several states. ''We had water cresting at 30 to 35 feet above flood stage, which is incredible,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''The flood stage is where the river is out of its bank. We're talking about 30 to 35 feet above that.'' The deluge appears to have broken the drought that has gripped Central Texas for more than a year. Late last month, as the rains started in Central Texas, the city of San Antonio had just announced drought restrictions limiting residential watering for lawns and cars. But the flooding and rains have replenished the Edwards Aquifer, the city's underground water source. ''I think it's highly unlikely we'll see any drought restrictions for the year,'' said Greg Ellis, general manager of the Edwards Aquifer Authority. ''We sure hate to see any flooding,'' but ''we get to be the silver lining in all this.'' For those people cleaning up their flooded homes, such news provided little satisfaction. Along Common Street in New Braunfels, which runs about 50 yards from the banks of the Guadalupe River, Manford Dobson, 47, spent the day ripping out the carpeting from his brick ranch-style house. His home and others abutting the river were a picture of devastation; at least three were swept off their foundations and washed down the river like broken tree limbs. ''I have to rebuild,'' said Mr. Dobson, a quality control engineer at a local construction company. ''I have no insurance. I don't know what I'm going to do.'' Capt. Dan Procknow of the New Braunfels Fire Department spent the day washing mud off Common Street. As many as 400 homes were destroyed or damaged as the area was flooded with ''over a million gallons a minute for 24 hours,'' Captain Procknow said. One house that washed away had been rebuilt on 12-foot stilts after a 1998 flood, he said. Farther west, in Bandera County, about 40 miles northwest of San Antonio, local officials said 1,000 of the county's 20,000 residents were evacuated last week. As many as 700 homes were damaged and nearly 200 were destroyed, and deputies still struggled today to reach people on isolated county roads. ''It's a mess, I can tell you that,'' said Richard Evans, the county executive of Bandera County. Mr. Bennett, the meteorologist, predicted that flooding would continue throughout the week in South Texas, much of it over farmland and other less populated areas as the crests of the different rivers moved to the gulf. In Goliad, Mary Jane Martin, the local emergency management spokeswoman, said that last week deputies began warning residents of low-lying areas to evacuate. By today, the muddy waters of the San Antonio River had already blocked Jefferson Street and other roads, effectively splitting the town. Leroy Johnson, 63, surveyed the rising water from his wheelchair. He lives on high ground above the river on Horseshoe Bend Road, which has been closed by flooding. Mr. Johnson's daughter, who lives on lower ground, had to ride a tractor across a field this morning to reach the road and go to work. She said she was likely to spend the next two nights at her father's house as Goliad awaits the crest of the river on Wednesday. ''I'm concerned, very concerned,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''Water is very destructive.'' He has lived by the river since 1946 and said there had been too many floods to count since then. ''But it seems like every time it gets worse.''"
"Anyone who has money, a good job or a friend in the right place has long since abandoned this riverside city. Banks and government offices have drawn their shutters. The medical clinic will close its doors for good next week. Empty buildings have been taken over by squatters. The people who remain here are poor, desperate, unlucky or all three. They are Noahs in search of an ark. Just over six months from now, the silt-laden Yangtze River, swelled by the giant Three Gorges Dam, will inundate Yunyang's quay, then the old promenade, then the river-view apartment buildings. It will lap up to the city's main street. Even the poor will have to move to higher ground by then, but many still do not know how. ''We want to live someplace that has flowers and lights, where it's pretty and not so dark all the time,'' said Jie Shibi, a 43-year-old mother of two who has lost her job as a port worker. ''We just want to leave.'' The Three Gorges Dam is the largest hydroelectric project ever attempted. It is someday supposed to generate as much electricity as 18 nuclear power plants and help control the flood-prone river. Yet its cost is high, even beyond the $30 billion price tag of the dam itself. The dam will create a virtual inland sea and raise the level of the Yangtze for 300 miles upstream, displacing 1.13 million people, more than 120 cities and towns, and uncountable historic artifacts. Low-lying Yunyang, the county seat, is the most intensely affected, with 160,000 people who must move. The government has provided some relocated people with homes in wealthier places, like Shanghai. Others now live about 20 miles upstream in New Yunyang. It has shiny pink- and yellow-tiled apartment buildings and a manicured park overlooking the Yangtze from a bluff. The heaviest burden is borne by those who are staying on in what will remain of the old city. Even after demolition crews finish blowing up buildings that fall beneath the projected new water line, and even after workers finish stripping the 1,700-year-old Zhang Fei Temple of its treasures and carting them away to a new site, many thousands of people will still call this place home. Parts of the old city will survive the deluge, but its residents say its spirit has been fully submerged. ''Emigration has left this place destitute,'' said Bao Yunfu, whose bookshop was empty of customers one recent evening. Managing the people who will lose their homes to the dam has in many ways proved a bigger engineering challenge than the dam itself. The government has allocated an estimated $10 billion to the task. But since resettlement began in 1993, the efforts have been dogged by rampant corruption and by complaints that the government has not always made good on its promise to provide factory jobs or alternative farmland to those displaced. Yet at least some of those who move find their circumstances significantly improved, while those who stay behind seem largely forgotten. Those who remain tend to be the ones without work units, the Communist Party's main channel to distribute social benefits and maintain social control. They are people who cannot afford homes in the new town, even with government relocation subsidies. They are peasants who lost farms near the river and have no place else to go. Red-lettered billboards, like targets on a rifle range, mark the meters of the coming flood -- 135, 148.4, 175. Nearly everything below 148.4 has been thoroughly ransacked, first by the families and companies that left, then by demolition teams removing traces of human habitation from the future reservoir floor. The city's lower reaches look as if they suffered sustained aerial bombing. Foundations are now ditches. A stone ramp to the port lies in a thousand pieces. The wind whips up clouds of architectural innards that look suspiciously like asbestos. People wander through the ruins collecting scraps to sell. One group uses an old grain storage warehouse as a dump. Discarded books, toys, bicycle tires and cardboard are stacked to the 20-foot ceiling. Chen Shunqing is one of the scavengers. He left his farm earlier this year because the government decreed that he and other farmers who cultivated the steep hillsides could no longer plant crops. Soil runoff adds to the silt in the brown Yangtze, which collects at the base of the new dam and requires constant dredging. Now, Mr. Chen, 48, is here trying to make enough money for his son to continue attending school. He tries to hammer an old motorcycle engine into scrap. When the head falls off the hammer, he uses the engine to bang it back together. Yunyang's once bustling port now handles almost no traffic. Capsule-shaped hydrofoils skim by without slowing down, as do the five-story ferry boats carrying tourists toward the Three Gorges. The beach serves as a dry dock for private contractors who repair or dismantle rusted river ships. Hulking barge carcasses in various states of destruction are propped up with rocks. Workers wave acetylene torches with one hand and smoke cigarettes with the other. Sparks fly, and the air smells of sulfur. There is no sign of supervision. Lan Tianguo, a former butcher who runs a ship-salvage crew, dismissed the need. ''We are careful enough,'' he said. ''We don't want to wreck our own ships.'' China's normally rigid social order has broken down. Residents talk about armed robberies and rapes. A boatman tells of an out-of-towner who was shot to death after a dispute with a taxi driver. Yunyang also has few of the usual population controls. Displaced farmers squat in buildings that will not be inundated until 2007, when the reservoir reaches its peak. Yang Yan, 19, moved to town from a nearby village with her boyfriend. They share a three-room apartment that has cement floors and no lights. The only decoration is a calendar from 2001, left behind by the owners. ''It's better than the village, which is very dark and cold,'' she said. Farmers, day laborers and porters are now the only regular diners at Xiang Guimei's noodle shop, which no longer sells noodles. ''Bank workers and officials used to buy noodle soup,'' Ms. Xiang said as she cooked over an open coal fire. ''But these guys,'' she said, pointing to her half dozen grimy-faced patrons, ''they only want cheap stuff.'' For centuries, the Three Gorges, the cliffs that rise into the mist over the mean surge of the Yangtze, have inspired poets and painters. More recently, they have attracted tourists eager to see their sheer vertical drop before the reservoir reduces it. But the river's towns have fewer admirers. The land is rocky and the soil is poor. It takes at least eight hours by fast boat to reach the nearest big city, and there are no railroads, airports or major highways nearby. Yunyang's fame comes only from the ancient temple honoring a Han Dynasty general, Zhang Fei. The temple was built in the third century to commemorate his battlefield victories. It has stood, though not without indelicate renovations, ever since. Dismantling it is now Yunyang's steadiest work. The government, addressing complaints that the dam would destroy too many cultural relics, vowed to preserve the temple by rebuilding it on higher ground, brick by brick. Locals have been pulling apart the stones for months now. One of them is Huang Bing, who is 21. He comforts himself that the temple, which he first visited with his father when he was 6, will be saved. But after a crane plucked Zhang Fei's statue from its altar one recent day, Mr. Huang and some friends burned incense and set off firecrackers, hoping to encourage the general's ghost to escape the flood. ''I don't really believe in Buddhism, but you never know,'' he said. ''Some people say we can move the stones but the spirit will stay behind.''"
"Sitting as close to the heavens as he could, Rabbi Karel Sidon took a moment before the Sabbath fell on Friday night to reflect on the floods that have inundated Central Europe this week. In Prague and beyond, the receding waters have left behind a carpet of sodden destruction. Across the still raging Vltava River, students and other residents were digging out from under a carpet of muck that had blanketed the cobbled streets and threatened the Baroque palaces of the historic Kampa district. In Prague's old Jewish quarter, there was flooding in the low-lying 14th-century Old New Synagogue and the nearby Pinchas Synagogue. But the rest of the quarter and the dozens of monuments around it were hardly touched. ''I thank God and the wall,'' said Rabbi Sidon as he looked up at his temporary sanctuary, the 19th-century Jerusalem Synagogue. The wall, which rescue workers named the Wall of Hope, is a fence of interlocking aluminum slats that was hurriedly put into place on the bank of the Vltava as floodwaters began to rise on Monday. By today, the local tabloid Blesk had crowned its builder, a Moravian businessman named Ladislav Srubek, as ''the man who saved Prague.'' Foundations for the $200,000 wall, designed by a German firm after floods hit the city of Cologne a decade ago, were put in place several years ago. ''It's not a miracle, it's just a smart piece of engineering,'' Mr. Srubek said in a telephone interview. He said plans and permits had been in place to extend the wall to other parts of the city, but it had not been a priority for the local government. ''Now they see it's worth it, and that's what's sad,'' he said. ''They knew it was possible, and they didn't want to do it.'' Nearly all of Prague's great art collections escaped major damage, although dozens of museums, castles and palaces are facing huge bills for structural repairs. Asked if the city could have done more to limit the flood damage, Mayor Igor Nemec said: ''Against this kind of catastrophe there are no measures you can take. It would be too expensive.''"
"As dams broke upriver in Bitterfeld and Mühlberg, inundating the towns, the people of Dessau were piling sandbags today on an earthwork dam -- but it was already leaking. The water level in Dresden finally began to drop from its record depth of 30.84 feet, but only by less than half an inch. But other less notable German towns were bracing for what is being called ''the battle against the water,'' and 30,000 people living along the Elbe and its bloated tributaries have been evacuated so far. Emergency workers from Hesse -- young people who chose to do nonmilitary duty when drafted -- were doing a lot of the heavy work, alongside local teenagers and housewives. They labored at a U-shaped bend of the Elbe, where the water comes closest to this town, famous for the Bauhaus, the modern design school founded by Walter Gropius. Two of the airy, geometric houses Gropius built for himself and other professors in 1926 are not far away. Nor is the water. Manuel Fehl, 21, got here with the emergency team on Thursday night and worked for 36 straight hours, before getting some sleep last night on a school floor. ''It's important for the country,'' he said, with a trace of embarrassment. ''When you see the commitment of the local people, it's impressive.'' But Martina Römpp, who owns 10 clothing shops in the area, is not optimistic that the river can be held. ''We live close by, where the warehouse is, and if the dam breaks we'll lose everything,'' she said, holding her two sons, 4 and 2. ''No one really tells us anything about when the water will come,'' she said, but she has her car packed, ready to evacuate. ''With two kids, it will be too dangerous to stay,'' with no electricity, the water so high and the nearby sewage plant in danger. ''If something breaks here,'' she said, the Elbe combining with the smaller Mulde River, ''it's all over Dessau.'' Ms. Römpp, 34, is one of the many Germans who believe that the flood is a result of environmental changes stemming from greenhouse gases. ''It's our new war,'' she said. ''We will have more of these floods from the heating of the planet.'' The German chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, in a tough battle for re-election, said proudly today that his government, in coalition with the environmentally friendly Greens, had reduced Germany's output of carbon dioxide by half in the last four years. Unfortunately for his chances, he has not been so successful in reducing unemployment. But politics were far from the mind of Peter Häselbarth, 45, who stood with his son, Jens, 19, and his badger, Sigi, 3, on his flooded street in Bitterfeld, 30 miles south of Dessau on the Mulde River. The water moved down Friedenstrasse, the main street, about 10 yards every 15 minutes, soaking into basements and yards. Rescue workers were using boats to move around the town. The town was once considered the environmental black hole of East Germany, a chemical center where a yellow haze hovered endlessly. Much has been done to clean it up, but still the water on Friedenstrasse had an oily stink, and emergency workers were toiling to protect the chemical plants in the town from the Mulde. Mr. Häselbarth was evacuated late Thursday night, leaving some of his other animals behind, including a pond full of fish. ''We were told we were in danger but it was too early,'' he said, so he returned today to gather more belongings, bring them up to the roof and feed the other animals. As for his fish, he said, ''maybe we'll find them in the garden when we come back again.'' But that is not likely to be for some time. An estimated 12 Germans have died in the flooding, along with 13 Czechs and about 60 people in Austria and Russia. But by comparison, more than 900 people died in the same period from seasonal floods in India and Bangladesh. Elsewhere upriver, workers gave up on the pretty town of Mühlberg, which was inundated when waters of the Elbe rose over a 33-foot dam. Even the local flood emergency committee had to be evacuated to higher ground in Torgau, where the Soviet Army met the American Army at the Elbe on April 25, 1945. More than 8,000 people were evacuated from around Torgau. Also upriver, an important railway bridge at Riesa broke, cutting train traffic between Berlin and Leipzig. Dresden, however, appeared to have emerged without severe damage to its cultural treasures, like the Zwinger Palace and the Semper Opera, where the basements and courtyards flooded. Further downriver, residents in Magdeburg, the next major city on the Elbe's path to the North Sea, were advised to prepare to leave. After the reunification of Germany, millions were spent rebuilding the eastern parts of the country. Mr. Schröder said the rebuilding now would have to begin again. Mr. Schröder has already promised hundreds of millions of euros in aid to affected German towns; Edmund Stoiber, his political opponent, called today for a fund of 2 billion euros, nearly $2 billion. In the meantime, the Swiss donated 500,000 sacks of sand, while NATO promised aid. But for Bianca Füller, 10, and Denis Röse, 9, skipping down the street in front of the Bauhaus, the floods have meant no school since Thursday. Are they afraid? ''No,'' Bianca said. ''I live on the second floor. I'll just go home.'' Denis, not to be outdone by an older girl, said: ''I live on the third floor -- that's best.''"
"A week after the River Mulde burst its banks and sluiced through streets here, Bitterfeld remains under siege. Military trucks rumble past, helicopters clatter overhead, and local officials are working round the clock, as the town struggles with a perilous clean-up operation. For all that, the residents are curiously cheerful. Natural disaster has given new hope to a town which had been deadened by man-made calamities. Bitterfeld is humming with something it has not had for years: a sense of purpose. ''It has created an enormous feeling of solidarity,'' said Mayor Werner Rauball, using a word laden with meaning in this once-Communist land. ''Together, the people are saving this town.'' Mayor Rauball insists that the experience is more than the fleeting high that often follows natural disasters, when neighbors pitch in to help one another. Bitterfeld stands to gain 700 state-funded jobs to help with the mopping up. It will also get millions of euros to fix ruined roads, bridges, and buildings. For a town with a 22 percent unemployment rate and a reputation as the buckle of Germany's rust belt, it is a huge windfall. ''Of course it has been terrible for the economy in the short run,'' Mr. Rauball said, as he monitored the water level. ''But I'm very optimistic about the future. We will have lots of new opportunities.'' Eastern Germans who live up and down the Mulde and its swollen sister, the Elbe, are finding a silver lining in the floods of the past month. As Germany prepares for an election in September, politicians are elbowing one another aside to appear compassionate toward this economically blighted region. Chancellor Gerhard Schröder has promised nearly $10 billion in relief funds, the bulk of which he hopes to raise by delaying a cut in personal income taxes and imposing a temporary increase in corporate taxes. His conservative opponent, Edmund Stoiber, also wants to pour billions into the region. But he says the government ought to find the money by tinkering with the budget. Mr. Schröder's take-charge response to the flooding has narrowed what had been an uphill battle for re-election. Whether the chancellor will be able to wring a political victory out of this calamity remains to be seen, of course. As a member of Mr. Schröder's Social Democratic Party, Mayor Rauball would love to capitalize on his leader's popularity. The trouble is, with nearly a quarter of the town's population still unable to return home, he has not been able to hand out voter registration cards. ''I don't think we can say yet how this is going to influence the election,'' he said. ''People have other things on their minds.'' Indeed, they are thinking of little other than how to stanch the rising waters of Goitzsche See, a 15-square-mile lake that was created 10 years ago from the pit of an abandoned coal mine. Fed by the rushing Mulde, the lake expanded its area by 20 percent in a single night, bringing its waters to the edge of the town center, parts of which had already been inundated by the river. As the waters begin to recede, engineers have found erosion on the far shore, which could raise the water level and, in effect, push it into the town. They hope to siphon off some of the water through a channel that tracks the original path of the river before it was moved to make way for the mine. More than 1,000 volunteers turned out to construct a mile-long dike around one corner of the lake. The volunteers, many of them teenagers, labored day and night for a week, some sleeping on piles of sandbags. It was a remarkable display of civic-mindedness in a town where teenagers -- idle, restless, and bereft of opportunities -- are usually locked in a cold war with their equally demoralized elders. ''We have no money and nowhere to go, so we stand on street corners drinking beer until someone calls the police,'' said René van der Wals, a loping 19-year-old who helped build the dike. Mr. van der Wals and his friends worked shoulder to shoulder with their parents. He says the shared experience improved relations between the generations, though he concedes that feelings may curdle again. Still, he wants to enlist as part of the 5,000-member clean-up crew being assembled by the German government. Workers will be paid $1,525 a month to work until the end of the year. That is almost $500 more than his unemployment check. He said he would be happy to do anything -- empty sandbags, sweep out basements, or cart away sodden heaters, washing machines and refrigerators. ''I need the money,'' Mr. van der Wals said, noting that his mother had lost her job in a newspaper kiosk that was flooded. Matthias Schüller, 36, has less hope about the redemptive effect of the flood, but he also wants a job. Mr. Schüller has been out of work since 1990. He has picked up only day jobs as a laborer or gardener, and would like a few months of steady work, but doubts he will be chosen. ''Even my father, who was 60 years old and the director of a factory with 50 or 100 workers, lost his job,'' he said. The same could be said of thousands of people in Bitterfeld. Built on the brown coal mines that scar the surrounding landscape, the town became the center of East Germany's chemical industry. After German unification in 1990, most of the factories were shut down, putting 30,000 people out of work. With its sulfurous air, toxic water and smoke-stained brick buildings, Bitterfeld stood as a forlorn symbol of environmental degradation in Eastern Europe. Hundreds of millions of dollars in government funds have cleaned up the town, but little has been done to retool its obsolete economy. Even those who want to join the clean-up corps have to navigate a thicket of bureaucracy. Several people stalked out of the labor office here today, complaining that they were not eligible to work because of the duration of their unemployment or the level of their benefits. Bitterfeld Journal"
"Floods that have caused billions of dollars of damage across Central Europe and have shut down the Czech Republic's biggest tourist attractions also did something almost unheard of today -- they stopped the production of the Czechs' two most famous beers, Pilsner and the original Budweiser. As floodwaters slowly began to recede in the historic center of Prague, heavy flooding threatened the southeast German cultural capital of Dresden, where Italian paintings and other artworks in the world famous Zwinger Palace gallery were left in a flooded basement, and where the Semper Opera will remain closed for weeks. City authorities prepared to evacuate thousands of residents and hospital patients with military helicopters if needed. Grimly, political leaders began to count the cost. Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany, who faces a tough re-election battle in September, traveled to heavily flooded areas in the former East Germany and announced about $380 million in swift aid. ''Ten years' work has been destroyed in a night,'' the chancellor said as he toured Grimma, a small town that had been renovated after reunification in 1990 but was severely flooded this week. Vaclav Havel, the Czech president, was criticized for remaining on vacation in sun-drenched Portugal while some of his country's most historic areas were submerged. He returned to Prague, and he toured the flooded district of Holesovice today. Noticing a submerged pub, he turned to a local resident and said, ''You have a pub right here, but you can't even get yourselves a beer.'' The taps may run dry, however, for a different reason: In the western town of Plzen, and the southern town of Ceske Budejovice, home of the original Budweiser, breweries stopped production this week because of the flooding. There was no estimate of how long production would be suspended, nor of the cost of the flooding to infrastructure and to Czech tourism, which has proven a boon to the economy since the 1989 Velvet Revolution overthrew Communism and brought Mr. Havel to power. Normally, thousands of tourists flock each day to towns like Cesky Krumlov, a Renaissance jewel in the south of the country. But its historic center is underwater and unlikely to receive tourists for the rest of the season, and the annual summer music festival there has been canceled, officials said. Elsewhere in Central Europe, Austrian authorities continued to struggle to contain the the Danube River, which has overflowed in several places, halting shipping. Greenpeace and other environmental groups tried to portray the flooding as a direct consequence of human-caused global warming, blaming oil companies. Many scientists said that the summer storms that swamped Prague and other parts of Europe, as well as South Asia, are consistent with rainfall patterns expected in a warming climate. Predictions call for more downpours. But experts stressed that no single storm, or single stormy season for that matter, could be singled out as linked to human alteration of the atmosphere. The progressive paving over of Europe's increasingly urbanized landscape has also left water no place to go but downstream and downhill. In Germany, where 12 people have died in the floods of recent days, workers in Dresden scrambled to save the precious artworks at the Zwinger Palace gallery. About 4,000 paintings were rushed to higher floors from basement storerooms, but the larger canvases could not be moved, museum officials said. ''We've got four enormous Italians trapped in the basement,'' said Uta Neidhard, an art curator at Zwinger Palace. She said those paintings had been lashed to the basement ceiling in hopes the waters would not rise that high. They included a work by Paolo Veronese, a 16th century Italian painter. The gallery will be closed for the foreseeable future, and the Semper Opera House, where floodwater has been pumped out of the basement, will not reopen for eight weeks, said Volker Butzmann, the opera's technical director. More than 200,000 Czechs have been forced to flee their homes this week in the worst floods for more than a century. ''It's as if somebody decided to wash this country away,'' a young Czech woman told a friend as she stood near a flood barrier in Prague early yesterday afternoon. Environment Minister Libor Ambrozek said the damages from the floods could exceed 20 billion crowns, or about $632 million. Although the waters began to recede in Prague late this evening, the danger moved swiftly down the Elbe River. Water was rising about a foot an hour at Usti nad Labem near the German border, and soldiers blew up a river barge that threatened to crash into a bridge near Litomerice, downstream from Prague. In Roudnice nad Labem, another Czech town on the Elbe, a television reporter pointed to the waters rising in the 18th century town and said, ''Every 10 minutes it is worse and worse.'' This morning, the sun finally emerged around mid-morning in Prague, glinting of the city's many golden-topped spires and roofs, as some of the 14,000 civil defense workers mobilized around the country to fight the floods watched the swollen Vltava River slowly recede. Volunteers rushed to plug waters pouring in through backed up storm sewers, which flooded low-lying areas inland from the river. Workers credited a ''wall of hope,'' a 10-foot-high fence of tightly interlocked aluminum slats backed by sandbags and anchored deep in the riverbank, with keeping more than 6 feet of water from spilling into the old part of Prague just south of the Charles Bridge. By midafternoon, the water was lapping at the tops of the barriers, and less than two feet remained beneath the arches of some major bridges. But by evening the water level had begun to go down. Mayor Igor Nemec of Prague said it could take up to a week for the floodwaters to recede, and officials said it could take a month or more to restore full service on the city's subway system. ''There's nowhere to pump the water,'' said Milan Houska, a metro official. Officials and art historians stressed that ''Prague is still open for visitors,'' as Jiri Kotalik, an architectural historian and rector of the Academy of Fine Arts, put it. ''The real center is untouched except for Kampa, but thank God, I think the buildings will not be heavily damaged,'' Mr. Kotalik said. ''They are built on medieval foundations, and Kampa used to be flooded every few years in the 17th and 18th centuries.'' That did little to reassure Marie Sediva, the director of the newly opened Muzeum Kampa, which houses collections worth an estimated $40 million. Marian Karel, a prominent glass artist who was helping her, said he was not worried that his own works might be damaged. But he said he feared for the museum's extensive collection of paintings by Frantisek Kupka, an influential painter at the turn of the 20th century, and an exhibit by the Czech collage artist Jiri Kolar, who died on Monday. ''I am alive, so I can always make my pieces again,'' Mr. Karel said. ''But the worst is the things by Kolar because they are going to bury him on Thursday.'' At Prague's riverside zoo, where keepers had to kill a hippopotamus and an elephant as floodwaters rose, five seals escaped into the rushing waters of the Vltava. Three were recaptured, but a zoo spokesman, Vit Kahle, said two were still at large in late afternoon. He said they could easily survive in the flooded Vltava. ''But we do hope they will come home today,'' he said. ''We have prepared dinner for them.''

"Under incongruously blue skies, more than 100,000 troops and hundreds of thousands of villagers patrolled dikes around giant, swollen Dongting Lake in central China today as officials expressed cautious hope that they had averted any major disaster from the summer's most menacing flood. The water level in the lake, which is considerably larger than Luxembourg, receded slightly today although it remained in the danger zone, according to reports by national and local television news and an official here in the Hunan provincial capital. But experts warned that lake waters might still peak Sunday and said vigilance was required to ensure that none of the dikes gave way. In several instances, officials said, potentially catastrophic seepages in the mainly earthen dikes and embankments had been spotted by roving teams of farmers and sealed by troops with sandbags and rocks. ''The water levels on Dongting Lake have fallen slightly today,'' said Xie Lejian, a spokesman for the Hunan Foreign Affairs Office. ''Whether the worst of it has passed will depend on whether there are any more major rainfalls in the next few days.'' Rain is not in the immediate forecast. Tonight, flood control officials downstream of the lake, along the Yangtze River in Hubei and Anhui Provinces, were bracing for an oncoming rush of waters, China Central Television reported. Officials and the Chinese news organizations have given wildly varying accounts of the scale of evacuations required so far around the lake, which is surrounded by a lattice of dikes protecting low-lying farms and millions of villagers. Two provincial officials said today that up to 270,000 people had been forced to leave their homes this month in Hunan, including many around the lake and others in vulnerable mountain areas. They discounted reports that 600,000 had been evacuated in the last week. Dongting Lake adjoins the Yangtze and serves as a natural spillover for the mighty river during flood season. But over the last 50 years, the lake and surrounding wetlands have shrunk by 40 percent as fertile soils have been taken by needy farmers. This made the region more vulnerable to floods. This year, more than 900 people have died from an unusual series of localized floods and mudslides -- first in central and southeastern provinces and most recently in Hunan, where 200 have died. But the Yangtze and other major river basins have not had wholesale floods, as in 1998, experts say, and are not likely to at this late stage in the season. In that year, when several stretches of the Yangtze, as well as Dongting Lake, overflowed, more than 4,000 people died. After those floods, the government promised to restore the lake's natural functions and to resettle more than two million people. The plan is partly carried out, though in most cases villages have been moved to adjacent high grounds and residents still farm the same vulnerable lands. These relocations, along with major investments to strengthen dikes over the last four years, have reduced casualties and destruction this summer, experts said. Waters have been allowed to flow into some of the relocation zones, but the current flood has not reached the stage at which officials must open dikes and divert water into large inhabited areas to prevent catastrophe in downstream cities. Much of the worst damage in 1998 involved such decisions by officials who were forced to choose between evils. Here in Changsha, the Xiang Jiang River -- a major feeder of Dongting Lake and a focal point of this month's floods -- dropped by several feet today, belying predictions of a peak surge. Four residents of a suburban village who described themselves as ''compulsory volunteers'' searched for leaks in the enormous embankment of concrete and dirt that channels the river past Changsha. ''The river fell dramatically today, and we feel out of danger,'' said Wu Guoliang, a 32-year-old driver who was putting in an eight-hour shift here. He said the water had been considerably higher in 1998, when his home was flooded, but that the dike had been raised 25 feet since then. -------------------- Villagers in Nepal Get Help THAPRA, Nepal, Aug. 23 (AP) -- Help reached residents of Thapra, east of Katmandu, late on Thursday, more than a day after a landslide obliterated their village, killing 41 people. A military helicopter arrived too late to help the dozens of people buried in the mud, or swept away by the roiling Likhu River at the base of the hill where the village stood. Only 13 bodies have been found. ''The land was boiling, it was melting away,'' Indra Basnet said today. The landslide clawed out his home and fields. His family was uninjured. The villagers say government assistance has been minimal. Soldiers and health authorities flown in by helicopter have distributed rice and helped dispose of some bodies."
"Chancellor Gerhard Schröder was out pressing the flesh here today, happier than he has seemed in weeks, with his steady leadership during the recent floods in Germany apparently paying off in the opinion polls. Mr. Schröder still has significant problems, lagging behind his conservative challenger, Edmund Stoiber of Bavaria, with elections only a month away. But heading into Germany's first televised debate between the two leading candidates on Sunday evening, Mr. Schröder can feel that he has made the electorate move a little in his direction at long last. In polls being published today and over the weekend, backing for Mr. Schröder's Social Democrats has risen two percentage points, to about 36 percent of the electorate, while the conservative parties have slipped a point or two, narrowing the gap. The Emnid Institute poll, for instance, has the Social Democrats at 36 points, up 2, and the conservatives at 39 points, down 1. Infratest Dimap has the Social Democrats up 2, to 36, with the conservatives steady at 41. The Election Research Group shows the Social Democrats up 2 points, to 38, with the conservatives down 2 points, to 39. But the Allensbach Institute says it has found no movement at all in its own fresh polls. ''The week of the flood was the week of the executive,'' Die Welt, a conservative daily, said today. ''The chancellor can thank his good crisis management skills, and the east is honoring him for that.'' ''This is a dynamic development,'' said Thorsten Scheider-Haase of the Emnid Institute. ''We'll have to see what next week brings.'' But when the floods in the eastern part of the country recede, many pollsters question whether the political landscape will have changed. Reinhard Schlinkert, director of Dimap, said economic issues remained foremost in the minds of 75 percent of voters. He said 53 percent of voters believed that the conservatives would handle the economy better, and only 20 percent picked the Social Democrats to do so. While Mr. Schröder is more popular than Mr. Stoiber as a candidate, polls indicate that 42 percent of voters think Mr. Stoiber would do a better job on the economy, compared with 28 percent for Mr. Schröder. The second most important issue is education, where Mr. Stoiber is considered to have done an excellent job as leader of Bavaria, which has some of the best public education in the country. Uwe Andersen, a political scientist at Ruhr University in Bochum, said the floods had helped Mr. Schröder change the subject. ''Crisis situations are good for the executive, and Stoiber's people have not taken a unified position on what to do.'' Instead, Mr. Stoiber hesitated before finally opposing Mr. Schröder's decision to delay planned tax cuts to help pay for the flood damage. Mr. Schröder has looked decisive, and Germans have responded with more than $130 million in personal donations for flood victims. ''The one good result from the flood,'' Mr. Schröder told a campaign rally today in Berlin, is the feeling that ''from German unification comes the unification of Germans.'' But Petra Coneus, listening in the crowd, was offended by the use of the flood as an election issue. ''We would have had the same solidarity under Stoiber,'' she said. Mr. Schröder is running hard to the left, stressing environmental issues and his refusal to support any military action in Iraq, which has led to a public spat with the United States. But that dispute appears to have helped him with an electorate that, given its history, is allergic to warfare and skeptical about the wisdom of the Bush administration's policies in the Middle East. One of Mr. Schröder's big applause lines today came when he said, ''I want to say right here and right now that I will not support any military actions in the Middle East.'' Angela Fried, 53, said he was right. ''Sept. 11 was terrible,'' she said, ''but it is being used now by the United States for warmongering.'' Mr. Schröder has an opportunity to score more points in the debate on Sunday evening, the first of two, which the German press has been playing up in an otherwise fairly boring campaign. Mr. Schröder is renowned as a good speaker, especially on television. Mr. Stoiber is so widely considered to be earnest but dour and somewhat tongue-tied, that anything short of a collapse by him should not hurt too much. In some sense, given such low expectations, Mr. Stoiber is almost at an advantage. ''It's like going into the ring with Mike Tyson,'' a Western diplomat said. ''If Stoiber is still standing after a couple of rounds, he'll have won.'' Yvonne von Starck, 30, expects little from the debate. Will she watch? ''Well, only if it's raining,'' she said."
"Below the paintings by Raphael, Rubens, Rembrandt and other old masters that crowd the walls of the Zwinger Palace hundreds of other works by Renaissance and Baroque artists are now lined up on the floor, survivors of what might have been a cultural tragedy when the palace's underground storage rooms flooded on Tuesday. Working by the light of candles and torches, 200 museum workers, police officers and soldiers carried some 4,000 paintings to the upper floors of the 19th-century palace as the Elbe rose by the hour. Six paintings too large to move were attached by ropes to pipes in the ceiling in the hope that the floodwater would not reach them. ''It was like a horror movie,'' said Martin Roth, managing director of the State Art Collections of Dresden. ''But under horrible circumstances, we were lucky. We found the right people to help and no one panicked.'' But the flooding has proved particularly traumatic for Dresden, an eastern city that since the reunification of Germany in 1991 has been working to rebuild itself around its historic cultural image. Even now, cranes stand above church towers as restoration goes ahead on the Schloss, one of the former royal residences of the Saxon dynasty that played a crucial role in turning this city into a Baroque jewel. For older Dresdeners, the flood has brought reminders of the rebuilding that followed the end of World War II. In February 1945, Allied bombers flattened the city, killing perhaps as many as 100,000 people in the resulting firestorm. It took East Germany's Communist government decades to rebuild. A Baroque church, the Frauenkirche, which was left in ruins for half a century, is now finally being rebuilt using much of the original material. ''We pulled so many bricks out of the ruins so we could use them again,'' said Irmgard Krause, 75, who came to look at the floodwaters today. ''And now this is shocking to see again.'' Ingeborg Richter, also 75, was even more upset. ''All this was reconstructed,'' she said. ''You could see the gold shining. And now it has all gone again. It throws it back all so far. It's almost like 1945 when the war ended.'' The Elbe, already close to its 1845 record high, continued to rise today as the water that swamped Prague earlier this week headed downstream toward its eventual release into the sea near Hamburg. In Dresden, the main railroad station, the Haupt-Bahnhof, has been flooded by the nearby Weisseritz River, while gardens on the northern bank of the Elbe are underwater. Some 3,000 of the city's 480,000 inhabitants, including 570 hospital patients, have been evacuated. Today, tourists and curious residents crowded the riverside area around the opera house and the cathedral as well as the Augustus Bridge that crosses the Elbe to watch the muddy swollen waters rushing by. Elsewhere in Saxony, the river continued to threaten towns and smaller communities. Some 20,000 people have been evacuated from the low-lying region around Magdeburg. Nine people in the state have reportedly died so far this week. Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who is involved in a difficult campaign for re-election next month, has promised help to the region, $100 million of it in cash for those most immediately in need. But, for the moment, the threat to Dresden's cultural heritage seems to have passed. Firefighters continued to pump water from the basement of the 19th-century Semper Opera, which has suffered damage to technical equipment and costumes. Officials indicated Wednesday that the opera could be open again within eight weeks, although they acknowledged that this might be overly optimistic. Mr. Roth, the state art official, said the 11 museums under his charge could be back to normal by early next year, although it will be costly to restore air-conditioned underground storage rooms. He said he plans to open new galleries for the porcelain collection at the Zwinger Palace on schedule on Oct. 6. The Albertinum, another Baroque palace, which houses Dresden's museums of antique statuary and 19th- and 20th-century paintings, was also forced to empty its basement on Tuesday. With the help of many of the same people who had saved the Zwinger Palace artworks hours earlier, some 650 paintings and 11,000 statues or antiquities were carried up a narrow staircase to safety. ''We had candles and we had to go up those very heavy things,'' said Helga Puhlmann, the spokeswoman for the state collections. ''You had women carrying heavy boxes. I put an Egyptian alabaster piece in a box with soft paper and carried it very carefully.'' Nowhere was relief greater than in the Old Masters Picture Gallery of the Zwinger. Many of its greatest masterpieces, like Raphael's ''Sistine Madonna,'' Giorgione's ''Sleeping Venus,'' Titian's ''Tribute Money'' and Correggio's ''Holy Night'' are permanently displayed on the building's second floor and were never under any threat. But the museum's collection is so large that there were many works by old masters that simply could not find room in the gallery. Now they lean against the room's wall, five deep -- safe, but uncertain of their future. Correction: September 24, 2002, Tuesday An article on Aug. 16 about flooding in Dresden, Germany, misstated the number of people believed to have been killed in the city during the Allied bombing and subsequent firestorm of February 1945. According to the city government, the toll was as many as 35,000 people -- not 100,000. (A reader reported the error by e-mail on Aug. 17; this correction was delayed for fact checking.)"
"Insurers and analysts have already begun to tally the economic impact of the rains and flooding in Central Europe, even as the floodwaters continue to surge downstream and burst the banks of rivers. Much of the billions of dollars in damage done to homes, farms, buildings and businesses will soon be reflected in insurance claims, hammering an insurance industry that was already having a tough time because of the sour securities markets this year. And two important industries in the region, tourism and transportation, are suffering direct disruptions that will be hard to overcome. For both those industries, the timing was especially painful. August is the height of the tourist season, and many of the region's most popular destinations are the medieval villages, old city centers and cultural landmarks in places like Prague and Salzburg that are along major rivers. River shipping is also being disrupted at a time of the year when huge amounts of bulk farm produce are commonly moved by barge. Perhaps nowhere outside the direct path of the flooding has the economic sting been felt more immediately and acutely than along the Danube, Europe's second-busiest inland shipping corridor, after the Rhine. Both rivers drain portions of the flood-affected region, but while the Rhine has largely remained open to cargo and cruise shipping, large sections of the Danube have been closed since last Friday. In normal times the Danube is navigable through 10 countries, from southwestern Germany through Central Europe and the Balkans to the Black Sea, providing a route for moving bulk goods like coal and grain economically in a region where road and rail connections can be crowded or creaky. But Danube commerce has often been hampered in recent years by the political turmoil after the fall of Communism in the early 1990's and then by war in Yugoslavia when NATO bombs left the Serbian stretch of the river blocked by the rubble of wrecked bridges. Cargo shipments on the river fell from 102 million tons in 1987 to just 27 million tons in 1997, according to the Danube Commission, an international body that oversees commerce on the river. The river had made a comeback in recent years, reaching about 44 million tons last year, but that was still only 10 percent of its capacity, according to Edgar Martin of Danube Research, a private consulting firm. Now nothing is moving on the upper reaches of the river. And some of the volume diverted by the flooding to other routes, like roads and railways leading to the Italian port of Trieste, will never come back, Mr. Martin said. When parts of the Danube were closed in 1999 and 2000, traffic at Trieste rose 25 percent, he said, and it did not fall when the river reopened. As a result, many of the large Danube shipping companies, some of them state-owned, have been struggling, cutting jobs and breaking up idle barges for scrap metal. The flood-related disruptions may be the last straw for many of them, Mr. Martin said. For insurers, the arithmetic is only beginning. Early estimates of the total damage in Austria are approaching $3 billion; in the Czech Republic, analysts say, the tally is likely to exceed the $1.9 billion incurred during the last serious flooding in July 1997, analysts said. The German Farmers' Association puts the likely agricultural losses in that country at $1.5 billion. Most of those losses are probably not privately insured, analysts said. In the 1997 floods in the Czech Republic, insurers were liable for about 20 percent of the total economic losses, according to Ivo Menzinger, head of the flood group at Swiss Re. He expects a similar ratio there this time, and a smaller one in Germany and Austria, where fewer people and businesses tend to be insured against flood damage. The Austrian Insurance Association said today that it expected the industry's losses in the country to total 100 million euros ($98 million), only about 3 percent of the preliminary estimates for total damage. Munich Re, the large German reinsurer, said the figure for German insurers was likely to exceed 500 million euros, but it could not say by how much. Even if insurers are not liable for most of the losses, the flooding will still be a big blow to them because of its scope, Mr. Menzinger said. ''It is rare to have damage in all these countries at the same time,'' he noted. Governments will wind up bearing much of the uninsured cost of flood relief and repair, analysts said. Mindful of elections coming next month, the German chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, has already announced $378 million in aid. Large additional spending on flood relief may put Germany far out of compliance with European Union rules limiting the size of budget deficits, but politically, Mr. Schröder has little choice, analysts said, and the emergency nature of the flood relief spending may make it easier for Germany to find forbearance in Brussels. Natural disasters can have unpredictable effects on economic growth; the damage and disruption can drag it down, or cleanup and relief spending can stimulate growth. Before the rains, economists were generally trimming their 2002 growth forecasts for the region from 1.5 percent to about 1 percent; several say now that the flooding will have only a minor impact on those estimates. ''It's wrong to say the floods are not economically significant, because they are,'' said Steven Barrow of Bear, Stearns. ''But it's not as if we've got the whole of Germany underwater.'' The big picture, though, smooths over the devastating effects the flooding may have on individual businesses and industries. ''It is a disaster,'' said Robert Fuehrnstahl, a traffic fleet manager for DDSG Cargo, the large privatized Austrian company that ships about 2.2 million tons of cargo a year, mainly on the Danube. With consignments of soybeans and wheat stranded in the company's cargo bays, Mr. Fuehrnstahl said he had been at his office window watching the Danube rushing by. ''What can we do,'' he said, ''except wait and drink a lot of tea?''"
"Prague emerged sodden and paralyzed today as the worst floods in its recorded history drained from buildings and poured down the Vltava River and into the Elbe. The Old Town, with its cultural monuments and museums, was protected by an aluminum flood barrier, although power cuts and flooded sewers prevented most people from returning to their homes for a second day. Basements and cellars in the historic center of the city were damaged, and officials said there was considerable damage to both the 14th-century Old New Synagogue and the Pinchas Synagogue, where the names of more than 78,000 Czech Jews who perished in the Holocaust were painted on the walls. Mayor Igor Nemec estimated damage would run into billions of dollars in Prague alone. The city's subway system had 17 stations flooded and will be out of commission for at least a month, he said, adding that dozens of buildings will have to be razed. Several thousand people were evacuated from the Czech cities of Decin and Usti nad Labem, and thousands more were forced to leave the Slovak capital, Bratislava, 200 miles southeast. The Spolana chemical plant released a cloud of chlorine gas, and environmental activists said they feared a stockpile of mercury and toxic dioxin stored at the flooded factory could wash downstream to Germany."
"The city's historic center, a premier treasure of European architecture, was losing ground today to Vltava River floodwaters that by evening had swamped low-lying zones. Tonight, with the river rushing at many times its normal volume, tens of thousands of residents had fled, alerted to expect a further surge after midnight. The city's most famous tourist attraction, the 14th-century Charles Bridge, was closed and a backhoe and crane were stationed on it to remove trees and other flotsam that crashed into its pilings. Former Mayor Jan Kasl said that without the removal of the debris pressure from the floodwaters could topple the structure. The entire district of Kampa, and historic buildings including the French Embassy, the John Lennon wall and the zoo were all under water several yards deep. Jiri Friedel, an official of the state company that regulates the Vltava, said he and fellow workers were fighting to save Novotneho Lavka, a small pier housing restaurants and dance halls that juts into the river a few yards upstream of the Charles Bridge. Prague's mayor, Igor Nemec, told journalists that water levels were expected to rise 10 more inches and that large areas of lower-lying suburbs could be inundated. A Prague City Hall spokesman, Martin Kupka, said it was impossible to tell what damage had been done to the city's architectural gems, but he said ''so far no buildings have collapsed.'' President Vaclav Havel cut short a vacation in Portugal, where the weather was hot and sunny, and was expected in Prague on Wednesday. At least three more Czechs have been killed in the floods since Monday night, including a 14-year-old girl who drowned near Tabor. The death toll in the Czech Republic now stands at nine; the total across Europe and Russia from a week of freak weather has reached 88. Meteorologists say low pressure and relatively high temperatures have created a virtual water fountain above Central Europe. As heavy rains lashed the region for the seventh straight day, pooling on saturated ground, already-battered cities south of Prague were also submerged. ''The area where the risk is greatest is Prague and everything below Prague,'' Prime Minister Vladimir Spidla told Nova Television tonight, after the government was evacuated from its headquarters in the Straka Academy on the river bank to a palace on high ground. South of Prague, the historic centers of Pilsen and Ceske Budejovice were under water. The center of Cesky Krumlov, a perfectly preserved Renaissance town, was inundated. In Pisek, waters rushed over the 13th-century stones of the Judita Bridge, Central Europe's oldest; only the heads of its decorative statues were visible. Water was expected to soak other areas for days longer. North of Prague, the Elbe, fed by the Vltava, overflowed in Dresden, leaking into the Semper Oper, the historic opera house rebuilt after Allied bombing in World War II. Flooding forced the closing of the city's train station and a hospital, news agencies reported. Some 15,000 people were evacuated from Melnik, where the Vltava flows into the Elbe, and 1,600 people were evacuated from Decin, where the Elbe narrows near the German border. In parts of Austria, at least, relief was in sight. The Salzach River was settling back into its channel, and hydrologists said there was no danger to Salzburg's old town, where Mozart was born. The city's famous summer music festival was not seriously disrupted by the high waters, although they closed bridges in the city center for several days. Viennese officials opened the New Danube, a channel parallel to the river, to keep floodwaters at bay. But large stretches of the Danube were closed to shipping. In Prague, the adversity brought out a rare spirit of fellowship among normally taciturn residents, who worked together to fill sandbags and pump water out of flooded basements. Many expressed anger that the city authorities had failed to prepare them for the floods. ''The system just doesn't work,'' said Jiri Domas as he pumped water from the basement of the Hotel Mucha in the Karlin district of Prague. ''I pay my taxes and these people were paid with my taxes to be prepared, and they weren't.'' Mr. Domas said he had had to buy his own sand and sandbags to protect his 39-room hotel. By nightfall, the city center was a ghost town, as offices and homes were evacuated and electric power was cut to many buildings to prevent blackouts. The luxurious Four Seasons hotel, alongside the Charles Bridge, sent its 130 guests elsewhere, said the marketing manager, Andrew Farnfield. The city's animals were not immune to the waters, either. While ducks and swans paddled placidly on the Vltava's rushing waters, penguins, storks and gorillas were evacuated from the Prague Zoo, and a crane was used to lift two rhinoceros to high ground. But one turned violent and had to be killed, and keepers had to shoot a 35-year-old Indian elephant named Kadir as water rose to his ears and he refused to move to high ground. If the rising floodwaters seemed at times tragic, there was also a touch of the absurd. As civil defense sirens wailed, firetrucks rushed past and police loudspeakers urged residents to evacuate the area, a group of French tourists from Nice stood yards from the floodwaters in seeming oblivion. ''The town will be flooded,'' said one Frenchwoman. ''Is this a joke or what?''"
"The Czech government is likely to abandon a plan to spend $2 billion to buy jet fighters from a British and Swedish consortium as the country struggles to cope with the costs of cleaning up from the huge floods this week, a Czech defense ministry spokesman said today. ''We must change our view of buying 24 supersonic JAS 39 Gripen fighters because we simply cannot afford it,'' Milan Repka, the defense spokesman, said in an interview. The government had approved a plan to spend $2 billion to buy 24 of the Swedish-made jets to replace its aging fleet of Soviet-built MIG-21 fighters, and hoped to win Parliament's approval in September. The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and has struggled to upgrade its military to NATO standards. The United States Embassy in Prague had complained to the government that its specifications in seeking bids for the aircraft had been written to exclude participation by American companies. An industry executive who has been following Czech arms purchases closely said that a decision not to proceed would give a ''lifeline'' to Lockheed, which withdrew from the bidding but may have another chance to sell its F-16 fighter to the Czechs. ''What's at stake here is a 30-year relationship with a country's air force,'' the executive said. ''You get a lock on the customer -- weapons, spare parts, upgrades, even replacement planes when they crash. It goes way beyond the 'fly-away price.' '' BAE Systems, formerly called British Aerospace, which had won the competition for the contract, had pledged to invest about $3 billion in the Czech Republic. A spokesman for BAE, John Nielson, said some of the investments would continue even if the Czechs decided against buying the fighters. ''We are ready to continue discussions on whatever the Czech Republic decides to do when it decides to do it,'' Mr. Nielson said. ''We are there for the long term.''"
"Parts of the historic center of Prague were under water tonight and 50,000 residents were ordered evacuated as rivers swollen by more than a week of near constant rain etched ribbons of destruction across Central Europe and southern Russia. More than a dozen people were killed by high waters today, pushing the toll for the last week well past 70. In Russia alone, 58 people have died in flooding caused by some of the heaviest rains in memory. With the worst rains since 1890 pelting the Czech Republic, Prime Minister Vladimir Spidla declared a state of emergency in nearly half the country. Late tonight, Prague's mayor, Igor Nemec, said Mala Strana, the carefully preserved heart of the old city, could be flooded by Tuesday afternoon because heavy rains had forced the opening of three dams farther south on the River Vltava. The mayor ordered residents to start leaving as soon as they could and said city schools would open before dawn to accommodate evacuees. In Austria, at least three people died as the Salzach River burst its banks south of Salzburg and threatened to inundate the city at the height of its famous summer festival, forcing authorities to close most bridges and major roads. Floodwaters rose in Hungary and Germany, and in northern Austria the authorities halted river traffic on parts of the Danube. Mayor Nemec said the Vltava River, which wends through the center of Prague, flowing fast through the arches of the historic Charles Bridge, was already more than five feet above its normal level and was expected to rise six and a half feet more by Tuesday. High embankments should protect much of the city center, but the floods expected on Tuesday would cover historic Kampa Island, a favorite tourist destination in the shadow of Prague Castle, parts of the Old Town near the medieval Jewish Cemetery, the working-class district of Liben and all the main islands in the Vltava. The mayor said the floodwaters could take up to a week to recede. In Linz, Austria, 120 miles west of Vienna, rescue workers lowered baskets from helicopters to rescue people stranded in their homes, and a fireman was swept away by roiling waters in Mariapfarr, near Salzburg. In the eastern German city of Leipzig, firefighters and soldiers helped residents battle rising waters as the Pleisse River broke its banks. German tourists fleeing the Austrian flooding found the autobahn between Salzburg and Munich under as much as five feet of water, Reuters reported. Three people died in Germany today, including an 8-year-old girl who was hit by an uprooted tree, and a state of emergency was declared in parts of the German states of Bavaria and Saxony. In Switzerland, the river port of Basel was shut after part of the swollen Rhine River was closed to navigation, and in France a sodden mountainside gave way, sliding into a highway near Moutiers in the French Alps. In southeastern Russia, where at least 58 people died when flash floods swept vacation resorts near the Black Sea coast over the weekend, authorities today began vaccinating residents and vacationers, fearing an outbreak of hepatitis A and typhoid. In Prague, soldiers and police officers were helping fill sandbags in a last-minute effort to protect pubs and residences dating back centuries on Kampa Island. Some residents said the government had moved too slowly to protect them. ''It's terribly badly organized,'' said Ladislav Pregner, as he moved sandbags to try to protect his hotel, the Golden Scissors, from rising waters. ''The cops just stand there, and if the waters come it's going to be a big problem.'' Mr. Pregner pointed to the half-dozen soldiers slowly filling sandbags as tourists milled around taking pictures. ''We had to buy our own sandbags and buy our own sand to fill them,'' he said. ''The city is totally unprepared.'' Farther along the embankment, floodwaters were already filling the basement of the Kampa Museum, and curators worked feverishly through the morning to move their collection of modern art to higher floors. By late afternoon, a huge wooden chair from the museum's collection, which once stood on a concrete pile in the river, was half submerged. Librarians evacuated books and rare documents from the basement of the National Library, the Klementinum, and from the basement of the Czech senate in the Waldstejn Palace. At least seven people have died from the storms in the Czech Republic over the last six days, including two volunteer firemen and, today, a vacationer who was swept away in the Prague suburb of Radotin. By late evening, floodwaters had risen in several historic towns, including Cesky Krumlov, a Renaissance jewel near the Austrian border, and the fez-making city of Strakonice, whose 12th-century castle sits on an island in the middle of the normally placid Otava River. There, the regional governor ordered 4,300 residents evacuated from the city center, and the authorities feared that it might take until dawn to move them all. Asked why it had taken until near midnight today to announce the partial evacuation of Prague, Mayor Nemec replied that he had been poorly advised. ''I'm not a water engineer,'' he told a reporter. Meteorologists said abnormal weather patterns had brought the region the equivalent of several months rainfall in just six days. Prime Minister Spidla said the floods were worsened by industrial farming and forestry that was introduced during four decades of Communist rule. ''We have to begin thinking about how to reconstruct our landscape in order to avoid such floods again,'' Mr. Spidla said. The Czech Hydrometeorological Office said late today that the heavy rains would gradually move eastward, with only occasional showers continuing in Prague and the south and west of the country. But a senior river water official, Jiri Friedel, said even light rains would increase the flooding. ''The ground is saturated and the water has no place to go,'' he said. Several hundred Prague residents and some of the many visitors drawn to the historic city gathered on the 14th-century Charles Bridge to watch the racing brown river waters. In the 19th century, felled trees shooting down the river in floods brought down two of the bridge's massive sandstone arches. In Zbraslav, an outlying suburb of Prague alongside the Vltava, Miloslava Prikrylova, 73, looked glumly from her ground-floor window at the flooded orchards across a highway. ''I've lived here 40 years and we've never seen anything like this,'' she said. Then, with a touch of the humor for which Prague is known, she added, ''I have my bathing suit ready.''"
"After a worrisome increase in small leaks, citizen patrols have been stepped up along hundreds of miles of dikes that hem in a huge, swollen lake here in central China. Still, the mood around Dongting Lake remained calm today, with officials and local residents expressing confidence that the network of protective dikes would hold through a peak in waters that has been predicted for Sunday. ''It doesn't seem so dangerous now,'' said Wang Renwei, 35, a rice farmer whose home and farm are vulnerable. There were no reports today of serious threats to those dikes or to the hundreds of thousands of residents who have remained in adjacent lowlands. Overall, it appears, Hunan Province and neighboring areas have battled this intense flood with remarkably few casualties. Officials said the weather upstream during the coming week would determine whether the flooding threat and need for vigilance along the dikes abated or was prolonged. The water level in the vast, multifingered lake, fed by the Yangtze River and four tributaries, was creeping upward today and was expected to rise four more inches before peaking on Sunday at about 115 feet. That is several feet above the danger point, at which rising water pressure can undermine dikes. But it is three feet below the level reached in 1998, when flooding along much of the Yangtze killed more than 4,000 people. That prompted major construction programs to raise and strengthen the region's protective walls. This summer, more than 900 people across China have been killed by floods and landslides, but few if any deaths have been reported this week during the menacing surge of Dongting Lake. Strains have begun to show, though, on the dikes, which are large earthen and concrete mounds, often with roads along the top. The first sign of trouble is usually a sudden gush of water that may appear hundreds of feet away from the dike walls. These ''gushers'' result from seepage underneath the dike, and if left untended for more than a few hours they can lead to disaster. ''The dikes have remained fairly stable, but we had a number of new gushers today because of the continued high pressure,'' said a water bureau official for Yongji county, covering a large southern part of the lake, who would only give his surname, Mr. Xia. ''Altogether, we've had 27 gushers during this flood season,'' he said, referring to his county alone, ''but 20 of those have occurred in the last two days.'' Though it is impractical to pinpoint the lakeside source of such seepages, they are easily countered with a technique used worldwide: sandbags are stacked in a circle around the gushing water, creating a pool that is filled in with sand and gravel. Water pressure in the makeshift tank equalizes that pushing in from the far side of the dike, halting the spread of the leak. Searching for gushers is the task of villagers who have been pressed into service here. They were prominent around the lake today, walking in lines along the dikes and poking at the earth with poles. Most wore big straw hats on this hot, sunny day when the lake region was eerily quiet, giving no obvious sign of the subterranean battle of earth and water."
"As the Elbe River reached a record high level here today, about 30,000 residents were evacuated from their homes while volunteers stepped up efforts to protect centuries-old palaces and museums. But fears are mounting over the devastation that the river may still cause as it plows through northern Germany toward the North Sea. After a night in which much of the city was blacked out, Dresden woke to fresh flooding. The four bridges crossing the Elbe were closed to all traffic but fire trucks and police cars. The area beside the grandiose Semper Opera and the sprawling Zwinger Palace gallery was for the first time under water, which had mostly bubbled up through manholes. Four hospitals and several hotels were evacuated overnight. By early today, the Elbe's swirling brown waters had risen to 29.5 feet, 9 inches higher than the high of 28.75 feet recorded in 1845. ''The floodwaters are still rising, and at the moment it's impossible to say exactly how far it will go,'' Mayor Ingolf Rossberg told reporters. He added that experts predicted that the river would crest at about 31.5 feet early Saturday. Across Central Europe, where at least 89 people have died as a result of the past week's flooding, cities and towns in Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia are beginning to measure the vast damage caused to homes, government buildings and factories. In Bratislava, the Slovak capital, the Danube River began receding from a 50-year high, while the authorities in Budapest were bracing for its swollen waters to reach the Hungarian capital this weekend. Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany has called for a ''flood summit'' in Berlin on Sunday. Leaders from Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia are expected to attend, as is Romano Prodi, the president of the European Commission, which has offered $63 million in emergency assistance to affected regions. Along the Elbe to the north of Dresden, flooding has already forced the evacuation of thousands of residents in some communities. Many have come to resemble ghost towns, with homes closed and shuttered, and sandbags piled up against doors. Even 100 miles to the north, in Dessau, the Elbe has already spilled out of its boundaries and flooded thousands of acres of land. Dessau, a rundown industrial town, is home to the Bauhaus, the landmark Modernist building designed by Walter Gropius in 1925 to house the famed avant-garde art and architecture school that was closed by the Nazis in 1933. Officials have moved an exhibit to higher floors, but there is a risk of damage to the building if the Elbe breaks its banks two miles away. Normally about 250 feet wide, the river is now a vast lake on the opposite side of Dessau. Volunteers worked feverishly today to fortify the dike protecting the town itself. At Dessau, the Elbe meets the smaller Mulde. On Thursday, the river breached a bank separating it from a manmade lake, which is now rising and threatening the industrial town of Bitterfeld, about 30 miles south of Dessau. Thousands of people have been evacuated from Bitterfeld, but the main fear is that the waters could reach a vast complex of chemical factories. The waters surged over the aging Spolana chemical factory in the Czech Republic this week, raising concerns about dioxin contamination. A company spokesman, Tomas Zikmund, said today that floods prevented his firm from checking whether the dioxin had leaked, but he said it was unlikely that the poisons had contaminated the river. ''It can be supposed that dioxins did not get into the water because there was no stream of water running away from Spolana,'' he said. In Bitterfeld today, the focus of prevention efforts was a low-level bank separating Lake Goitsche from the town. As trucks arrived in convoys with bags of sand, hundreds of volunteers worked under a fierce sun to build up the defenses. Dtelef Hübsch, drove 15 miles with his son, Christian, 18, to help out. ''People have come from all over the region,'' he said, waving his muddy arms toward the crowds of volunteers. ''There is a lot of solidarity.'' Birk Löwenberg, 28, who works for a wholesale food company in Halle, 25 miles to the west, stood beside a van in which he had brought food and drinks for the volunteers. ''We were called by a Protestant group and asked if were willing to do something for Germany,'' he said. ''We agreed without hesitation.'' The flooding in Germany has so far affected mainly regions of the former East Germany, still the poorest part of the republic. Unification in 1991 brought a sharp rise in unemployment as many government-owned factories were closed and as modernization drastically cut bloated staffs at others. Especially in the east, the flooding has become an electoral issue. The government of Mr. Schröder, who is seeking a new term in general elections next month, has offered the region hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and has promised to invest heavily in reconstruction. Katrin Schuchardt, a government railroad employee who drove a visitor past dozens of abandoned factories in Dessau, said her main worry was unemployment. The threat of flooding forced her to leave her home and move her family into her mother's third-floor apartment, but even with Mr. Schröder's pledging huge emergency assistance for flood victims, Mrs. Schuchardt said new jobs were the priority for the region."
"His full white beard and flowing hair shining bright in the dim cellar, Jaroslav Krejci lifted his arms like an Old Testament prophet as he surveyed his sodden, mud-smeared, foul-smelling art studio. ''This atelier was my genius loci, it felt like a small country mill,'' he said. ''Now my whole life is lost.'' A shaft of sunlight poured in through a windowless frame, illuminating a wooden chair with a single rubber glove on it, a small curtained alcove and row upon endless row of once-carefully sorted black-and-white negatives. They represented 36 years of work documenting the modern history of Czech theater, whose small companies, at a galvanic moment in the 1960's, spawned Czech new-wave cinema and were entwined with the anti-Communist dissident movement. All those negatives are now ruined, victims of the raging floods that tore through the Czech Republic last week, inundating parts of the old Mala Strana district, with its winding narrow passages and Baroque buildings in the shadow of Prague Castle. The floods submerged large swaths of the Czech Republic, leaving broad ribbons of destruction, including hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to the country's cultural fabric, though a formidable number of artworks were saved during the pandemonium. Much of the damage is hidden: undermined foundations, devastated castle gardens, soaked cellars and damaged heating and alarm systems in castles, museums, galleries and archives. On a smaller scale, there was damage to irreplacable cultural artifacts, like Mr. Krejci's photographs, and on the personal effects and creations of artists who have flourished since they won back their freedom with the fall of communism in 1989. The damage is still being quantified and evaluated, but fund-raising for recovery has already begun, including pop and classical music benefit concerts around the republic. Unesco has promised aid, but no amounts have been determined. None of this country's major art collections were harmed, although a number of archives and the rare-book collection of the Prague Municipal Library were badly damaged. At a half-dozen of the scores of delicately preserved castles and chateaus that cover the Bohemian and Moravian countryside, gardens nurtured for centuries were ravaged in days, foundations were washed out and freshly painted and plastered walls were soaked. At the Baroque Chateau of Veltrusy, in Melnik, north of Prague, the Vltava River meets the Elbe, and at this convergence a vast lake formed, devastating the 18th-century English gardens, which themselves had replaced French-style gardens destroyed by a great flood in 1764. In Pisek, a medieval gold-mining town 60 miles south of Prague, where the 14th-century stone Old Bridge is the oldest in the Czech Republic, the flooded Otava River knocked a Baroque stone sculpture off its balustrade before throwing much of the balustrade into the water. ''Thankfully, we had repaired the bridge two years ago, so the bridge itself stayed up,'' said Zdenek Novak, the deputy minister of culture. Near the head of the Vltava, the once exquisitely preserved Renaissance castle town of Cesky Krumlov, a tiny jewel box of period architecture, was clobbered. Its aristocratic pink-and-white castle tower was untouched, but the town center, wrapped in a bend in the Vltava, was under more than six feet of water at the flood's peak. ''The scene was apocalyptic,'' said Robin Schinko, an architect and member of the county council. ''We can fix the houses, but the reason why this town was made a historical monument can never be restored.'' To much original fabric has been lost to the river. But in Cesky Krumlov as elsewhere, a resolve to rebuild and continue is evident. By Wednesday, a week after the floods had peaked, tourists were back picking their way through waterlogged streets and the town's annual August musical festival was back on schedule. Here in Prague, floodwaters backed through storm sewers to fill the sanctuary of the 13th-century Old-New Synagogue with almost five feet of reeking river water. In the 16th-century Pinkas Synagogue, where the names of nearly 78,000 Jewish Czechs killed during the Holocaust were carefully painted in tiny letters on the plaster walls, five feet of water filled the sanctuary and curators fear that the plaster may soon start to flake. The Old Jewish Cemetery was untouched and all the artifacts from the Jewish Museum's several buildings were removed days before floodwaters arrived for safe-keeping. Leo Pavlat, the director of the Jewish Museum here, said he feared that the damage to the synagogues and other buildings that make up the Jewish Museum could cost up to $4 million to repair. The museum will be closed until the end of September as cellars are pumped dry and equipment is replaced. A wall of interlocking aluminum slats hurriedly erected along parts of the Vltava to hold back flood waters protected Old Town and its museums, galleries and two opera houses. But city officials never authorized building foundations for such a wall elsewhere in the city, leaving Mala Strana and the working-class districts of Karlin and Liben vulnerable. Instead, a half-dozen theaters, including the Karlin Musical Theater and the avant-garde Archa Theater were below water, their stages and sets ruined. Just a few yards from Mr. Krejci's atelier, damage in the low-lying parts of Mala Strana was horrendous. Workers used crowbars and hammers to dismantle 23 grand pianos in the courtyard of the Jan Deyl Conservatory and Piano-Tuning School, where floods destroyed all the workshops and nearly all the instruments. The school, which trains students who are blind or have other disabilities, lost about $1.6 million in equipment, estimated the school's director, Miroslav Dvorak. ''There is no way we will get it all together to start school in September,'' he said. Across town from the Mala Strana, at the Prague Municipal Library, Pavla Pursova, one of the librarians, was near tears as she recounted how hundreds of rare books were soaked despite being moved for safekeeping. Among those ruined were an edition of the rare 1488 Prague Bible, the first in the vernacular Czech (the New York Public Library has another copy), and the 1836 first edition of ''Maj,'' or ''May,'' a poem by the Czech Romantic Karel Hynek Macha. ''This is a terrible blow. I want to believe that these books can be at least partly saved, but when I look at them I doubt it,'' she said. The municipal library and several archives have been carting their damaged collections to a frozen-food processing plant, where they will be frozen to halt further deterioration until they can be vacuum-dried. Meanwhile, the books are being stored in freezer trucks. The waters in Terezin also damaged archives in the Small Fortress, which served as a Nazi camp. Nearly all of the camp's records were inundated. ''It's all been digitalized, but nothing can replace the originals,'' said Mr. Novak, the deputy minister of culture. By the Vltava's edge, Marcela Flasarova, a museum administrator, was wiping mud from the second floor of the Muzeum Kampa, a new gallery intended to present the extensive collection of 20th-century Czech art amassed by Jan Mladek and Meda Mladkova. More than 200 works by the early 20th-century Czech painter Frantisek Kupka, and over 100 more by Jiri Kolar, the poet and collagist who died last week, were moved to an attic depository just hours before the floods hit. River mud poured through the museum's ground floor, shattering windows and doors and destroying heating and cooling systems. But the collection emerged virtually unscathed. A stone statue of a woman by Miloslav Chlupac was dismembered by the floodwaters, and river mud filled the museum's courtyard and basement. An oversize wooden chair by the contemporary artist Magdalena Jetelova was washed away. That brought an outburst of black humor from the painter Antonin Strizek, a member of Tvrdohlavi (the Stubborn Ones), a loose circle of prominent artists in their 40's. ''The problem with modern art is that when it is not in a gallery, no one knows what it is,'' Mr. Strizek said and then made a wry grin. ''It could end up in a garden in Dresden, and the Germans will think the Czechs use strange chairs.'' The biggest tragedies of the flooding were personal. Mr. Strizek's ground-floor atelier, where he worked for the last 15 years, was flooded to the ceiling when waters inundated the the Karlin district of Prague. He had only a few minutes to evacuate his workshop before dawn one morning last week. ''I was able to take a few drawings, but I left behind paintings and a cabinet of family photographs,'' he said. Some 30 canvases had to stay behind, but he hopes they can be salvaged. But gone are the pictures of his children growing up, the slides that documented his career and the record of where he has sold his work. The floods may create a new, creative impulse for some artists, Mr. Strizek said, but overwhelmingly, the feeling is one of immense frustration. In the basement belonging to Mr. Krejci, the theatrical photographer, the waters also swept away memorabilia, like the chair from which the dissident philosopher Jan Patocka (a student of Edmund Husserl) gave lectures to human rights activists in the 1970's, when the Communist secret police had banned him from public life. Among the two-thirds of Mr. Krejci's ruined negatives was a chronicle of every significant moment in small theaters such as Vaclav Havel's Theater of the Balustrade and Jiri Grossmann's eponymous theater. About 4,000 images of Mr. Havel and the Civic Forum movement as the velvet revolution unfolded and brought down communism in 1989 were also gone. Former students of Mr. Krejci's picked up negatives to try to save them, but Mr. Krejci was inconsolable. His work space had turned into something sadly surreal. ''It's like a theater here,'' he said. ''Like a stage set.''"
"When the waters of the Malse River poured into the Budejovicky Mestansky Pivovar (Budweis City Brewery) here in the beer-making capital of the Czech Republic in August, the managing director, Miroslav Lestina, a bear of a man, stopped shaving. ''I'll take it off when we get the brewery running again,'' said Mr. Lestina, his cheeks and chin dark and furry, as he led a visitor around the mud-spattered buildings a few weeks after two waves of flooding ravaged the brewery. The swollen rivers that roared through the Czech Republic have settled back peaceably within their banks, leaving workers at dozens of factories and businesses with the huge job of shoveling away the mud and blasting muck and mildew with pressure sprayers. But it has become clear that more than sunshine, soap, water and elbow grease will be needed to get the country's damaged industrial base back to health. Government and private economists estimate that the direct costs of the flooding will be at least 110 billion koruny ($3.6 billion). The Czech Statistical Office has warned that the country's economic growth rate has probably been slowed to 1.5 percent from 2.5 percent. Job losses have yet to be calculated. The government expects to spend about $1.2 billion itself repairing flood damage. But on Friday, the Parliament narrowly rejected a government proposal to raise rates on sales and income taxes to finance the cost. Opposition leaders argued that the necessary funds could be found in the existing budget and that the government was using the floods as an excuse to ram through a broader agenda of tax changes. For private industry, the floods may have wrought more lasting changes than just the physical damage from high water. The Czech Republic's haphazard post-Communist privatization left many companies stripped of their best assets, burdened with huge debts and in the hands of managers struggling to adapt. When the floods hit, many of these companies were already in perilous shape, and often underinsured. Czech enterprises that had been bought by multinationals over the years generally fared well. Many have elaborate disaster-recovery plans and have been able to shift production abroad while they ride out a temporary collapse in production or local demand. Few locally owned companies can say the same. At the 207-year-old Budweis City Brewery -- which has battled for decades with the neighboring 107-year-old Budejovicky Budvar brewery and with the American brewer Anheuser-Busch over the rights to the Budweiser brand name -- the high water came in two waves, five days apart, and much faster and deeper than had been forecast. The floods knocked huge brewing kettles off their mounts. Steel aging tanks that hold batches of beer for up to three months bobbed against the ceiling. The once shiny bottling line emerged from the receding river water jammed and rusted. An entire warehouse of empty kegs was washed away, and thousands of pallets of mud-caked beer bottles had to be discarded. Like most Czech companies, the brewery had no business-interruption insurance coverage. Mr. Lestina said that that other local breweries, built on higher ground, had stepped in to supply his customers, at least temporarily. About 40 percent of the 6.6 million gallons of beer that Budweis City Brewery had expected to produce this year would have been sold in and around the city of Ceske Budejovice; most Czech pubs serve only one brand of beer. ''We have some stock left, but we can't bottle or fill kegs, and a lot of bridges were washed out, so we can't make our deliveries,'' Mr. Lestina said in mid-August. ''I just hope the big hyenas won't take our markets.'' Another danger looms in the company's staggering debt load. Like many potentially profitable enterprises sold by the state, the brewery's parent company, Jihoceske Pivovary, was bought by an investment fund that was linked to Investicni a Postovni Banka, a bank that has since failed. The brewery floundered under the management of the bank, and control of it was sold to Frantisek Chvalovsky, a former soccer star who at one point was jailed for tax fraud. The brewery borrowed heavily, and was finally repossessed by the government and sold to its current owner, a Budejovice businessman named Jan Divis. By then, two satellite breweries and an office building had been sold to repay creditors, but the company still owed some 280 million koruny ($9 million), nearly equal to a year's revenue, at interest rates near 14 percent. Before the floods, the company had hoped to break even this year and post a profit next year. Mr. Lestina finally shaved off his beard in early September. The sweet, heavy smell of malting hops had by then replaced the stink of river mud, and the brewery had managed to resume serving most of its former customers and avoid laying off any of its 145 workers. Altogether, Mr. Lestina said, insurance will cover about 85 percent of the 130 million koruny ($4.3 million) in physical damage. But new machinery to replace what was damaged will cost much more than the older equipment was worth, and nothing will restore the 25 million koruny ($804,000) in lost sales. ''We still have to rebuild half the brewery,'' Mr. Lestina said. ''All our modernization was wiped out, and we are back to brewing by hand the way we did 15 years ago.'' Fifty miles north, in Pisek, a medieval gold-mining town, six feet of water filled the main factory of Jitex, a cotton knitwear maker, when the first of the floods came Aug. 13. ''We were told to expect a 100-year flood, and we were prepared for that,'' Miroslav Kosta, the company's personnel director, said in a late-August interview at the plant. ''But what came was a thousand-year flood,'' he said, stretching up to touch the thin line of brownish-gray film, marking the high-water line on a wall that was still damp. Spinning and knitting machines on the ground floor were half-submerged, but cutting rooms and other operations upstairs were spared, he said; Jitex's finishing factories, some on higher ground nearby and others out of town, came through safely. ''Only the end of the process is working now,'' Mr. Kosta said of Jitex's plants. ''They have some stocks of material, but we have orders from abroad to fill, and we need to keep those customers. We can't produce any new material, and we can't dye any material now.'' After the floods, Jitex subcontracted some of its orders to other Czech factories, but it was already under pressure from cheaper goods brought into the country illegally without customs duty. ''We do everything to meet standards, protect the environment, pay a minimum wage,'' said the company's sales director, Jan Rousal. ''It makes our products more expensive than things produced with child labor in Vietnam. We want a level playing field, but the law is being broken by people who import without paying taxes.'' Matters have been harder by the rise in the value of the Czech currency, which has gained 25 percent against the dollar and about 15 percent against the euro in the last 12 months. Add that loss of competitiveness to the flood damage, and the company is teetering on the edge of survival, Mr. Rousal said. Even before the floods, Jitex had big problems. A group of investors financed by Investicni a Postvni Banka took control and then went bankrupt after saddling Jitex with heavy debts. Their 42 percent stake in the company is to be auctioned by a bankruptcy administrator later in September, and Mr. Rousal and his colleagues are hoping that investors who plan to keep the company intact will outbid a group that wants to redevelop its land. Under an ambitious recovery plan begun long before the floods, Mr. Rousal and fellow managers cut the work force to 1,650 from 2,500 this year, and they had hoped to break even by December. But now, Jitex expects losses of about 20 million koruny ($643,000) this year on revenue of about a billion koruny ($32.2 million), even after getting some low-interest loans and tax relief the government has promised. The most pressing concern is making the monthly payroll of 20 million koruny. Mr. Rousal said by telephone recently that the power was back on at the flooded plant but that the company's future remained an open question. Insurance will cover less than one-third of the $12 million in physical damage. Government grants will help pay workers for a while. But in Jitex's battle to survive the flood, Mr. Rousal said, ''We still don't know who won.''"
"The waters from the calamitous floods in Europe last month have receded. What is left -- in Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic -- is the political debris, wreaking more havoc than expected. Here in Austria, a dispute over tax relief for flood victims ignited the strife within the far-right Freedom Party that led the chancellor, Wolfgang Schüssel, to dissolve Parliament and call new elections. In the Czech Republic, the fledgling government of Prime Minister Valdimir Spidla teetered near collapse after one of its coalition partners voted against a tax increase to help flood victims. In Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's take-charge response to the disaster halted the momentum of his conservative challenger, Edmund Stoiber, who had appeared to be headed for an election victory. ''The repercussions of that rain have been Europe-wide,'' said Anneliese Rohrer, the foreign editor of Die Presse, a leading Austrian newspaper. ''The floods have turned over the political landscape.'' Some analysts say the floods may be remembered as the political point-of-no-return for Jörg Haider, the right-wing populist who became a behind-the-scenes power broker in Austria's conservative government. Two weeks ago Mr. Haider, the Freedom Party's de facto leader, demanded that his party colleagues in the government retreat from their plans to defer a tax cut to pay for disaster relief. They refused and quit the party en masse. Mr. Haider seemed intent on reclaiming the helm of the party, a position he gave up two years ago so it could enter the governing coalition. On Saturday, however, he unexpectedly announced that he would not lead the party in the coming elections after all. He maintained, to the widespread hoots of his critics, that he had been threatened by an unknown man outside a restaurant and feared for his family's safety. ''Haider was always a problem psychologically,'' said Peter Ulram, a pollster and political scientist. ''But this time he lost touch with reality. He's become ridiculous.'' Mr. Haider may swerve yet again. But the chaos has hurt the party -- its support is down from 27 percent of the vote in 1999 to as little as 14 percent in recent polls. In elections now scheduled for November, polls predict that the thin majority held by the governing coalition could evaporate, giving way to a left-of-center government. The ouster in 1999 of the Social Democratic Party, which remains Austria's largest, was accelerated in no small part by the strident populism of Mr. Haider, who opposes immigration and the enlargement of the European Union. Once in power, however, the party lost Mr. Haider as leader and found its message blunted by the exigencies of government. Mr. Haider watched in frustration from his redoubt as governor of the southern province of Carinthia. He had managed to remain a voice in Austrian politics, particularly creating a furor over relations with the Czech Republic and its scheduled entry into the European Union. He called for a veto on Czech membership unless Prague closed a nuclear power plant on the Czech-Austrian border. ''Opposing the E.U. may be bad for Austria, but it's a great political issue for Haider,'' Ms. Rohrer said, warning against writing Mr. Haider's political obituary. ''Austrians are afraid. They're afraid of foreigners. They're afraid of losing their jobs.''"
"Jacques Féraud, a sturdy factory worker, has lived in a daze since Monday night when he failed to save his mother. Infirm at 84, she drowned inside her home. ''I tried to carry her,'' he said, sobbing. ''But a wall of water just knocked us down.'' Juliette Féraud is one of five people who died in this Provençal village when a dike broke and waves of water from the Gardon River rolled through these lowlands in the Rhône Valley in southeast France. Aramon is one of the hardest hit, but close to two dozen small towns and villages have been severely damaged by floods resulting from 36 hours of heavy rain earlier this week that swelled rivers. Officials said today that at least 21 people had died and that 8 were still missing; rescue workers are focusing on the most remote farms. The waters are receding, but brown lakes cover a land known for its ancient stone villages, vineyards and melon fields, with the greatest damage in a region known as the Gard, between the towns of Orange and Nîmes. The wine produced here is known as Côtes du Rhône, and although the impact of the flood and the fierce rains has not been fully calculated, wine growers' cooperatives estimate that more than half of the grape harvest of the Gard and a smaller portion in the Vaucluse -- accounting for almost 10 percent of France's vineyards -- might be ruined. Floodwaters reached 12 feet in the lowest areas, said Pierre Prat, a policeman, at the command post in Aramon. He said he had spent the past 48 hours going out on small boats, plucking people from roofs and balconies. He estimates that Aramon has about 1,000 houses, and said he thought ''more than 500 had water up to the second floor or to the top of the roof.'' In some outlying areas, he added, ''the water was so high, sometimes we had to duck to pass in our boats under the overhead electric wires.'' Such rescue teams, which also involved military helicopters, have ferried several thousand people to higher ground in the past two days, according to a spokesman for the Fire Department in nearby Avignon. In villages like Montfrin, Comps and Théziers, farmers wading through the mud were trying to take stock of their losses. René Coullomb, who had recently retired at 70, wiped his face with his red neckerchief and swallowed to hold back his tears. ''I already know my losses,'' he said. ''Two horses, 55 rabbits, 60 chickens, and I cannot find the ducks.'' In this region between the Alps and the Cevennes, rivers have a history of turning into deadly torrents, and people see flash floods as part of life. Many buildings have plaques on the walls marking high-water levels from past inundations, mostly from the mighty Rhône, which has largely been tamed. In older farmhouses, families often live on the second floor. But residents complained bitterly that local officials had not given people adequate warning of the floods. At the local school in Aramon, where rescue workers distributed food, bottled water and cups of red wine, farmers said that even though the Gardon and some of its tributaries reached had flood levels by midday Sunday, no one sounded the alarm. Some also said the dike that burst gave warning signs, largely ignored, hours beforehand. Residents of Aramon said they became aware of danger only when the church bells began to ring frantically on Monday night, about an hour before water overwhelmed the village."
"Forget last year's drought. Now, local governments across the region are hurrying to prepare for having too much water from heavy rains and snow melt this weekend. The National Weather Service predicts that as much as two inches of rain will fall through Sunday across the region. Combined with continuing mild weather and a melting snow pack, forecasters said that the region will face the equivalent of four inches of rain making its way down gutters, through drains and into streams and river by dawn on Sunday. The National Weather Service has posted flood watches for 31 counties in the region, stretching from New London in Connecticut, across all of Long Island and New York City, and arcing through Westchester and Rockland down across the low-lying counties of New Jersey from Warren and Somerset to Cape May. The National Weather Service has forecast rain moving into the region from the Southwest overnight and through today, when the heaviest rain is expected. Besides warning citizens to keep storm drains clear and fire hydrants visible above the snow, counties are deploying pumps and heavy machinery in New Jersey, preparing to use sand bags if needed in Westchester, and alerting Connecticut residents about high tides on the Long Island Sound. ''We have a lot of snow cover on the ground that's packed, that's saturated and that's ready to release a lot of water,'' said Tim Morrin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service forecasting office in Brookhaven, Long Island. ''And then we have one to two inches of rains expected on top of that. So we're expecting flooding in any poorly-drained areas, especially where the snow pack has not been cleared.'' Although the region faced severe local flooding from the one-two combination of melting snow and warm rain in 1996, the relatively warm weather of more recent winters has given officials some time off from their usual late winter water woes. ''We've had so many mild winters that this one seems really unusual,'' said Pat LaRocca, emergency management coordinator for Middlesex County, N.J. ''But maybe this was the normal one, and the others were unusual.'' Many emergency officials said they were used to seeing the flooding from a winter thaw, either from ''ponding'' by rain and snow melt behind clogged drains -- the kind of flooding most likely to occur in cities -- or along the shores of rivers and streams that have been clogged by ice dams. Since Wednesday, workers have been clearing storm drains of snow, gassing up portable pumps, preparing search-and-rescue boats along major rivers, urging citizens to be prepared, and watching the skies. ''We have this pretty well under control,'' said Dannel P. Malloy, the mayor of Stamford, Conn. ''We know where we are likely to have flooding based on conditions that preceded this winter'' -- he mentioned the Shippan and Cove sections along the Long Island Sound -- ''and we're pretty confident we can handle it.'' But Frank J. Ryan, the mayor of Bound Brook, N.J., was more wary. Parts of his town on the Raritan River have flooded nearly every year for years, usually during hurricane season, and he said the town's 14 public works employees have been busy keeping drains cleared and trucking snow to parkland. ''We should be used to this by now, we've been through it enough times,'' Mayor Ryan said. ''But at this point we have to rely pretty heavily on the county to tell us what we should expect.'' The warm weather of the last few days produced spectacular ice breakups along the Delaware, and the Delaware River Basin Commission reported rising water behind ice dams -- usually behind bridges - as far upstream as Port Jervis, N.Y. The ice blocked the river at the Calhoun Street bridge at Trenton on Wednesday, said Carol R. Collier, executive director of the commission, and the river rose to within five feet of its flood stage. The bridge has since released the ice, and the river has returned to normal, but Ms. Collier said the authorities would be watching the big ice floes that have yet to make their way downstream. ''Mother Nature is in control, and we should all be prepared,'' she said."
"In the largest relocation of artworks in France since World War II, museums here have begun evacuating about 100,000 paintings, drawings, statues, sculptures, books and other valuable objects from underground storage rooms that would be expected to flood if the River Seine were to rise to or beyond the record level of 28 feet, reached in 1910. The decision to move this art to an undisclosed location north of Paris followed the floods that swept Central Europe last summer, damaging museums and other cultural institutions, notably in Dresden, Germany, and in Prague. Although French art collections were not seriously affected by the 1910 floods, the French government concluded that Paris museums were more vulnerable today. In 1910 many museums did not have their basements packed with art objects as they do now. Some, like the Musée d'Orsay, did not even exist. At that time, however, the museum building was a railroad station, the Gare d'Orsay, and it was flooded. ''In 1910 this space was completely submerged,'' said Jean-Jacques Aillagon, the French culture minister, who stood on the ground floor of the Musée d'Orsay when he announced last week that the transfer had begun. ''The threat is real.'' Along with the Musée d'Orsay, which houses the principal collection of 19th-century art in France, many artworks are also being moved from the Louvre, the National School of Fine Arts, the Central Union of Decorative Arts, the Georges Pompidou Center, the Modern Art Museum of the City of Paris, the Carnavalet Museum and several libraries. Government officials estimated that 600 truckloads of art would be moved in the coming weeks. In some cases, like at the Musée d'Orsay and the Louvre, the immediate threat comes from the possible overflowing of the Seine. In others, like the Pompidou Center, the main danger is posed by rising groundwater and flooding of underground drainage and sewage canals. The Pompidou Center, which gained experience in moving its collection when it was closed for renovation in 1997 and 1998, has already transferred about 3,000 paintings, drawings and sculptures. The government has assured the museums that they will have 72 hours' warning of a possible flood by the Seine. As a result, several museums have decided to move only those artworks too heavy or cumbersome to carry to higher floors within that period. In the case of stone and bronze statues considered impractical to move, the Louvre has stocked protective plastic wrapping. ''These storerooms are not dead places,'' Henri Loyrette, president of the Louvre, noted, echoing the reluctance of several museum directors to be separated from a good part of their collections. ''They are constantly visited by researchers and play a central role in the scientific life of the museum.'' The Louvre is nonetheless expected to move 5,000 artworks. For the Louvre, a major flood would cause still greater problems because its laboratories, workshops and archives are in basement areas susceptible to flooding. Its archives are to be transferred permanently to the Palace of Versailles, but it is thought impossible to move other equipment, including X-ray machines, without disrupting the Louvre's operations. Even the Louvre's main reception area, below I. M. Pei's glass pyramid, could be flooded. Mr. Aillagon estimated that all the moves could cost about $6 million, which would be paid by the French government and individual museums. He refused to disclose the location of the warehouse for security reasons, although he noted that the space had been rented for two to four years until a permanent solution could be found. Although the Seine reached a threatening level in 1955, the possibility of a devastating flood was not broached by architects and officials in the 1970's and 80's when the Pompidou was built, the Gare d'Orsay became a museum, and the Louvre was expanded. ''An overflow of the Seine comparable to 1910 has gradually faded from our collective memory,'' Mr. Aillagon said when he announced the planned transfer last October, ''but we cannot ignore the reality of such a risk this winter or in future winters.'' The gamble is that no major flood will occur before the transfer is scheduled for completion on April 7."
"November was actually the cruelest month. For about two-thirds of it, the water that usually edges and lattices this improbably liquid city sloshed amok, turning Piazza San Marco into a gargantuan puddle and other low-lying areas into shin-high wading pools. January was bad, too. Right at the start, the lagoon rose, the canals swelled and Venetians slipped back into their galoshes, while tourists teetered atop makeshift boardwalks that had been set up to bridge the dry patches, too few and far between. ''We've had it,'' said Adreano De Giulio, the manager of a restaurant here that posts, on the wall, an ever-lengthening list of each significant flood and the heights that the tides scaled. It goes back four decades and records more than 150 days of watery misery. ''It's time to do something,'' Mr. De Giulio said. Now more than ever, that feeling seems to pervade this storied but endangered architectural wonderland. But this month provided a fresh illustration of how slowly and uncertainly Venice is paddling toward a solution. In government meetings in Rome, including one today, officials were expected to give concrete approval for the construction of a sophisticated system of 79 sea gates to be placed along three openings where the Adriatic meets the lagoon in which Venice is situated. On days of exceptionally high tides, the gates would rise from the sea floor and close those openings, controlling the water level around Venice. But that grand plan, which would be executed over the next eight years and could cost more than $3 billion, keeps bucking up against opposition, and the meeting today did not yield a steady green light. Officials were still wrestling with the profound concerns of environmentalists, who assert that the project would further dirty an already polluted lagoon and are pressing their case in courts. The project has already been delayed about 20 years, during which it was researched and researched again, refined and refined anew, and batted from one Italian government to the next. ''At the end, one thing I can say is that this will be one of the most studied projects in the world,'' said Flavia Faccioli, an Italian architect who is supervising the project. ''If this project isn't done, or if another project isn't done, the suffering will only increase,'' Ms. Faccioli said in an interview on Monday, adding that already ''Venice has changed in a frightening way.'' Built on soggy foundations that were later weakened by industrialization, Venice has been sinking for a good long while. By some estimates, the land below the city settled by 5.1 inches over the last century, while the sea rose 4.3 inches. Doors and windows that were once well above the pavement are now flush against it, because entire alleyways and squares have been raised through the years in an attempt to keep the city afloat. The ground floors of many residential buildings have been abandoned and are now simply vestibules, pitted and corroded by the saltwater that laps into them during the increasingly frequent floods. The ratio of tourists to residents is higher, in part because so many Venetians have fled for dry land, diminishing the permanent population in the historic heart of the city from about 150,000 half a century ago to about 70,000 today. ''What is at stake is the use of this city as an ordinary city,'' said Paolo Costa, the mayor, who has generally supported the sea gates project but has also called for more study of the environmental impact. Mr. Costa said that without the traffic of real life through the exotic maze of Venice, it would become infinitely less enchanting. ''It would be like you were in Williamsburg,'' he said, referring to the American colonial village in Virginia. Some projections for this century show that the combined effect of the sinking of Venice and the rising of the sea, worsened by global warming, would cost Venice a further 8.6 inches. Other predictions put that measurement higher, and opponents of the project cite these in saying that the sea gates, intended to work for about 100 years, would be sufficient for only 30 to 50. They also say that the gates would eventually have to be raised 100 times a year, not the half-dozen times that the project's supporters suggest. According to critics, that would prevent an adequate exchange of water between the lagoon and the sea, changing the lagoon's ecosystem. ''Looking long term, there's just no hope,'' said Dr. Albert Ammerman, a Colgate University archaeologist who has looked into the problem. ''You're going to have to do something radical and different,'' Dr. Ammerman said, adding that the sea gates were ''a giant toy.'' But with a paucity of alternatives, Venetians seem inclined to embrace the sea gates project. A recent poll of 1,500 residents showed that 67 percent support it. They are tired of treading water. ''I've got the boots,'' said Matteo Toboga, who works in a bookshop here, referring to the kinds of adjustments that Venetians make. ''But the last time I used them, they weren't high enough, and the water got in my shoes.'' Many store owners, who cannot move from street level, hustle to move and protect their wares at the first bleat of sirens that signal a coming flood. ''It takes me half an hour to dismantle the gallery and move the paintings,'' said one owner, Luciano Ravagnan. ''This is not mineral water we're talking about,'' he said, referring to the pollution of the lagoon. ''It ruins everything.'' He said he wanted to see the sea gates installed, and had only one concern and message for government officials. ''Please,'' he said, ''don't take another 20 years.'' Venice Journal"
"Somehow, in a where-else-but-New-York kind of way, this sounds like the Tommy Dorsey arrangement about how the music goes round and round and comes out somewhere or other. Water gushing from a knocked-over fire hydrant went round and round beneath Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street yesterday until it lapped over a high-pressure steam pipe. The cold-meets-hot combination created a geyser of asbestos-tainted steam that came out in front of some of New York's priciest stores. It showered parked cars with reddish-brown debris before Con Edison workers shut it off. They also shut off heat and hot water to 10 nearby buildings that rely on Con Edison's steam system, including three office buildings on Fifth Avenue and the Museum of Television and Radio on West 52nd Street. Next door to the museum, at the ''21'' Club, dishes could not be washed after lunch -- two of the restaurant's dishwashers depend on steam. ''We have a zillion dishes here,'' a spokesman for the restaurant said, ''so we're O.K.'' The police closed Fifth Avenue between 48th and 54th Streets after the accident, which happened just before 10 a.m. Traffic was rerouted to Madison Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas for much of the day, though by late afternoon two lanes of Fifth Avenue were re-opened. Con Edison said it had not figured out exactly why the steam shot from the street. In its search for an explanation, Con Edison will dig up the street and examine the steam line. Witnesses said the steam erupted after a truck making a delivery at the Cartier store at the corner of Fifth Avenue and East 52nd Street knocked over a fire hydrant. One Cartier employee said the episode had been captured by a security camera, and the store had shared its videotape with the police -- though not, of course, until after the delivery had been made, the truck had pulled away and the steam had spewed. Whether the tape showed the license number of the truck was not known. The steam bath began about 10 minutes after the truck's departure, witnesses said. Michael Clendenin, a Con Edison spokesman, put the time of the eruption at 10 a.m. He said that by 10:40, Con Edison crews had shut off the steam valves in the area. Soon, the cleanup began. Workers with street brooms and large shovels began putting debris into trash bags and piling them at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street. Later, the workers hosed down some of the parked cars and wiped them clean. Charles G. Sturcken, a spokesman for the city's Department of Environmental Protection, said that samples of debris had tested positive for asbestos and that Con Edison had expanded the cleanup to include buildings in the neighborhood. He said that officials would conduct an inspection after daybreak today and, assuming they find nothing that should have been mopped up, they would open the other lanes of Fifth Avenue. ''We presume there's asbestos when there's a leak like this,'' Mr. Sturcken said. ''We wipe the cars, we wipe the sidewalks and take samples. The health professionals will tell you it's long-term exposure for asbestos which causes concerns in the health community. Once you do the cleanup, the area is safe and you're not going to have any contaminants around.'' Con Edison's steam mains run as large as 30 inches in diameter, but Mr. Clendenin said the ones beneath Fifth Avenue measured 6 to 8 inches. As steam pipes go, they were fairly young. He said that they had been installed in the 1990's. After past steam-pipe breaks, Con Edison has said that steam pipes suffer little wear and tear over time, even though steam is zooming through them at more than 100 miles an hour. Above ground, the geyser and the disruptions it caused left some would-be shoppers grumbling. Rod Sager of Dallas, whose 11-year-old-son, Dennis, was carrying shopping bags from the Museum of Modern Art, had been on their way to the N.B.A. store, on the northwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street. ''We started on Fifth and 55th,'' Mr. Sager said. ''We walked to Sixth and came onto 52nd.'' They gave up there. Mr. Sager was ready to head back to their hotel. Dennis, though, had another destination in mind, one well away from the steam zone: F.A.O. Schwarz, at Fifth Avenue and 58th Street."
"Fierce winds and rain cut a destructive swath across Europe in the past two days, killing at least two people, flooding parts of Germany and Belgium, and halting traffic on the swollen Rhine River. The winds, which sometimes reached hurricane force as they howled from Britain to Austria, knocked down hundreds of trees, causing widespread power outages and chaos on roads and railway lines. In Germany, a 13-year-old boy was killed and his father seriously injured when a tree fell on their car near Stuttgart. An 18-year-old was killed when his car flipped over on a treacherous road near Hamburg. Germany, which is still recovering from calamitous floods last August, has been inundated by rain for several days, swelling the Rhine to dangerous levels and causing its tributaries to burst their banks. ''It's been raining here hard for the last three days,'' an official at the water and shipping office in Cologne told the Reuters news agency. The Rhine was more than 15 feet higher than its normal level, forcing the German police to close a 90-mile stretch south of Cologne to barge traffic. The Mosel and Main rivers, which flow into the Rhine, were flooded in several places, the police said, also halting traffic. In Belgium, serious flooding has led the government to put the army on alert. Two weeks of torrential rain have left much of the southern and western parts of the country under nearly three feet of water. ''Almost every house in this region has suffered grave damage,'' Philippe Cloet, a flood coordinator in Ghent, told Reuters. ''All these people will be confronted with water-related problems for the next six months.'' Dresden, which was swamped during the summer, is still drying out its opera house and museums. The cleanup effort cost the German government nearly $10 billion. The damage from these storms is not expected to approach that level, though the German reinsurance firm, Munich Re, said it could total several hundred million dollars in Germany alone. Gale-force winds ripped through Britain and France earlier in the week, cutting electricity to 10,000 people and disrupting rail service. Flood warnings were maintained in Paris, where the Seine continued to rise, and in southern Britain, where the waters were finally receding. Relief is not yet in sight, with the German weather service, DWS, forecasting more rain. In northern Portugal, the downpours triggered landslides in the valleys of the port-wine region. Emergency workers were searching for a car that witnesses said had plunged into the Douro River. Winds of 60 miles per hour this morning cut power to thousands of people in parts of Austria. The Czech Republic and Romania were also hit by winds and flooding. The storms add to what has been a freakish year of weather in Europe. Northern Europe has endured violent wind and rain, in addition to a record-breaking cold snap last month. Farther south, balmy temperatures have left much of the Alps without snow, playing a different kind of havoc. A World Cup ski race scheduled for Monday in Hinterstoder, Austria, was canceled because of a lack of snow, while downhill and slalom races were moved from Chamonix, France, to Bormio, Italy, as organizers hunted for snow, according to the International Ski Federation."
"Every person in this little village at the foot of the Catskill Mountains has lost two children, as have their neighbors in Hamden and in Sidney Center. ''When I first heard about it, I couldn't sleep that night,'' said Asra Rab, as she stood along a bank of the Delaware River, near the broken trees and makeshift memorial where 10-month-old twins drowned on Wednesday after their mother's car was swept into the flooded river. ''I feel very sad, so sad.'' She said she did not know the babies, Grae and Brahm Dykstra, or their parents, Dawn and Frank. No matter. She lives close to the river and knows of them now. She knows, from widespread news media accounts, how the Dykstras tried to have children for 11 years. On her fifth attempt at in vitro fertilization, Dawn became pregnant. The twins were born a few minutes before midnight on Dec. 31 -- the last boy and girl for 2002 in the Southern Tier, and the family was included in a year-end article in The Binghamton Press & Sun-Bulletin. ''After all the years of crying, pain and sadness, this is just one gift after another,'' Dawn Dykstra, then 42, was quoted as telling a reporter. On Wednesday, Mrs. Dykstra was driving home with the children from her job at a Tyco Healthcare plant in Hobart. She was just outside Delhi, halfway through her 40-mile trip to the family's house in Sidney Center, amid the region's dairy farms and maple-sugar stands. Mrs. Dykstra told rescuers she did not see that the river had flooded its banks at the base of the rolling hills until her PT Cruiser was in the swirling waters. She was sucked out of her car near Fitch's covered bridge and could not fight the current to make it back to her children. She flagged down Jay Clark, a contractor from Hamden, who said he summoned help before putting Mrs. Dykstra in his pickup truck next to his 11-year-old daughter and taking her to O'Connor Hospital here. ''When I first heard about it, I was hoping it was a false call, a Halloween prank,'' said Delaware County Sheriff Thomas E. Mills, who met Mrs. Dykstra at the hospital. ''She was in shock, cold, and very distraught.'' The sheriff said he called for help from every fire, police and ambulance squad within an hour's drive. His son, Michael Mills, a village police officer, lived close and ran to the river without shoes, chased by his fiancée carrying a pair of boots. A few miles away, Carl Orlando, the pastor of the Assembly of God Church, where the Dykstras worshiped regularly, was in a meeting when a firefighter was paged and ran out. ''We started to pray,'' Mr. Orlando said. ''Before the meeting was totally finished, Frank was knocking on the window. I put it all together and I said, 'Oh God, no.' '' Mr. Orlando went with Mr. Dykstra to the hospital. Later, he brought the grieving parents back to the church, where they spent the night. As the disaster unfolded, many people in nearby towns learned of the rescue efforts on their personal police scanners. Soon, they lined the river bank, some with flashlights, some with prayers, all hoping to find the car. ''There were so many people there, we were actually concerned about their safety,'' said one rescuer who would not give her name. ''The river was just going crazy.'' Divers found the car the next morning, the twins still strapped in their car seats. ''I wouldn't have been able to stand it if the river had whipped them away,'' said Delhi's fire chief, Gerard Garofalow. ''Being a father and grandfather, I hugged those babies to my chest before I laid them down.'' A nearby resident set up a memorial by the river, where friends and strangers are leaving flowers, balloons and stuffed animals. The Dykstras held a private wake on Friday, and will schedule a burial service with their relatives. The church has organized a scholarship fund. People are praying for the parents. Asra Rab seemed to speak for all of them. ''How could it happen?'' she said, staring into the muddy river."
"The last time William Boyer Sr. ran into one of his old friends from this community, the place Mr. Boyer called home for 30 years, the man brushed past him with no hello, no smile, not even the slightest of nods. ''I couldn't believe it,'' said Mr. Boyer, who is in his late 60's and in poor health. ''Just walked right on by.'' That does seem difficult to believe in a city of fewer than 300 people, a place where family names have stayed the same for decades and where drivers wave to one another as they pass. Unbelievable, unless you consider what happened here after the flood. During one long summer 10 years ago, floodwaters swamped Chelsea and hundreds of communities across the Midwest, killing 50 people and damaging 50,000 homes in nine states. Still, the flood itself, residents here say, brought out everything people like about living in small places. They united. On each waterlogged edge of Chelsea that summer, volunteers in boats stayed up night after night to keep looters out. Young firefighters hoisted furniture above muddy waters in living rooms. People rode tractors through high waters to deliver meals to older residents who insisted on staying put. But after the waters receded, so, too, did some of that unity. A community that had cheerfully worked together to tough out a natural disaster seemed more challenged by the political storm that followed. People were split over whether to move away from this low spot beside the Iowa River or to stay put. Many who stayed insist that there are no lingering sore feelings. Sure, they have watched Chelsea's already shrinking population shrink some more in the years since the flood. Still, says Larry Frese, who owns one of the remaining businesses in Chelsea, the tavern, ''The city looks better than ever.'' What happened after the storm, he said, has simply meant that the most dilapidated homes have emptied and been demolished, adding, ''We got rid of the negative people, too.'' For some who left, like Mr. Boyer, who accepted a government buyout for his Chelsea home, memories are raw. ''Too many people were arguing and fighting,'' Mr. Boyer said, as he watched television in his new three- bedroom home in Tama, a town 11 miles down the road. ''So many people were trying to make you do what they wanted you to do, and I really had to get away from all that water.'' The onetime friend who ignored Mr. Boyer in the grocery store not long ago was part of ''the clique'' that wanted everyone to stay in town, Mr. Boyer said. ''I don't hold it against Chelsea,'' he said. ''It was a very good town to live in. But this kind of took the enjoyment out of it.'' Around the Midwest, the fall of 1992 was a wet one, and then, the next March, more rains began soaking ground that was soaked already. As summer approached, the rain kept coming. Although river flooding can happen with regularity in this region, as it did this past week in Indiana and Ohio, the 1993 flood was devastating and widespread. Soon, the Missouri and the Mississippi Rivers, and many tributaries including the Iowa, had risen out of their banks. Barge traffic stopped. At different times, bridges closed from Davenport, Iowa, to St. Louis on the Mississippi and from Kansas City to St. Louis on the Missouri. Airports, railroad lines and parts of interstate highways shut down. Here, in a lush valley of farms 70 miles northeast of Des Moines, Chelsea was covered in slow-rising waters, from the Iowa River on one edge, Otter Creek on the other. But in Chelsea, which was settled in the 1860's, mild flooding can come almost as often as the new corn crop, and people here take a certain amount of pride in not being bothered by a touch of water. Longtime residents, many of whom are of Czech descent, rattle off the big flood years: 1918, 1944 (when two local girls were killed), 1969 and of course, 1993. When water began covering the first floor of Bill Kent's house 10 years ago, he and his wife, Alice, simply moved upstairs. Mr. Kent was born in this house 100 years ago, and the idea that one more flood might scare him, or even send him packing from a place that holds so much significance to his past, amuses him. ''There are other floods that are far more negative than water,'' Mr. Kent said on a recent evening, as he sat in his backyard watching trains chug by. ''Like bootleggers and drug peddlers -- those are floods other places. If we wanted to be somewhere else, we would be.'' But even for people accustomed to flooding, 1993 was frustrating. The water did not recede for days. And when the levels finally did drop, they rose again, more than once, erasing the smells of Clorox scrubbings that had come in between. When it was over, local, state and federal officials began meeting. All over the Midwest, the authorities were looking for ways -- by moving whole towns or individual families or something else altogether -- to get homes out of flood zones for good. The idea, too, was to protect the government from having to pay, again and again, to rebuild the same communities. In the end, the Federal Emergency Management Agency spent more than $150 million in the nine states affected in 1993, a FEMA official said, buying and tearing down nearly 12,000 homes, moving more than 300 homes to safer places and elevating 31 others. In Chelsea, the City Council voted in 1994 to move as much of the community as possible to a nearby hill, out of harm's way, with what was to be millions of dollars in federal help. It would be a new, higher Chelsea. But people took sides. Those in favor said they could not bear another flood. Those against said they could not sacrifice the rich history of their community for the certainty of staying dry in some new, generic place. The mayor at the time favored the move. The tavern owner, Mr. Frese, was against it. And the banker, who owned part of the hill in question, did not want to sell. ''Too much land is being eaten up by concrete,'' the banker, Gary Fattig, said on a recent afternoon, from behind his desk at the Chelsea Savings Bank where he is vice president. He said that he also had concerns about possible Indian burial mounds on his property, as well as an endangered species. Complicating matters, state and federal officials had little experience at that time trying to move whole towns. ''Every agency had a different deadline and a different idea, and it wasn't working,'' said Jerry Knox, an Iowa State University professor, now retired, and part of a team that tried to help Chelsea plan its future. So, as the plan seemed to be slipping away, some residents quietly began moving to higher ground on their own. Many accepted government buyouts of their homes, which would then be demolished. Some received about $30,000, they said. ''I would have stayed in Chelsea. I had every plan to move up the hill, but it wasn't going to happen,'' said Frank Fetter, a former City Council member who moved to nearby Toledo, Iowa. ''There were hard feelings, bone hard feelings.'' One man was heckled near the tavern as he and his house, pulled along on wheels, left town. The owners of about 45 homes left, but the majority in the city remained. Still, a place that was struggling long before the flood, as so many small farm-based towns have, showed more signs of trouble. The oat processing plant closed. The city's latest economic hope is a housing development -- on a nearby hill. The city bought the land, ran utilities to it and called it Riverview Estates. Only three people bought lots, so the city tried a radical measure: it would give away lots as long as the takers agreed to promptly build houses. More than a year later, though, only one man is finishing his new house. Eleven lots await. ''We thought they would just go like hot cakes,'' said Roger L. Ochs, who is now mayor. From Beverly Gerard's front stoop on Station Street, the view has changed entirely since the summer of 1993 when muddy water ran in the street. The water is gone now, of course, but so are many of her neighbors. Houses that were once beside hers are demolished. ''They've all moved away,'' said Mrs. Gerard, 75, pointing next door to a blank lawn and recalling with a smile how the children who used to live there had once enjoyed her baking skills. ''It's kind of like living out in the country now, so much open space.''"
"AFTER a decade of construction work, China will today close the sluice gates of the giant Three Gorges Dam and forever alter the landscape of its historic heartland. When the gates close, waters from the mighty Yangtze River will begin filling a reservoir that stretches nearly 400 miles, or about the length of Lake Superior. Hundreds of thousand of people who lived in ancient villages along the banks of the Yangtze have been resettled upland. Their homes, many already reduced to rubble by scavengers, will be inundated in the first stage of flooding that will raise the water level as much as 450 feet above the river floor by the middle of June. The event marks a mid-point in the building of the dam, which began a decade ago and is estimated to cost about $25 billion. It is expected to be completed in 2009. China's government views the project as engineering wonder that will control flooding, produce as much electricity as 10 coal-fired power plants and improve navigation along the turbulent Yangtze. Critics see it as a monumental folly that will wipe out relics of China's ancient civilization, uproot the lives of some 1.13 million people, threaten aquatic life and partially fill the vertiginous gap between a series of spectacular cliffs known as the Three Gorges. Authorities in recent weeks scrambled to complete the final relocation of the area's most prominent ancient relics, like the temple of the Han Dynasty general Zhang Fei and the tomb of Liu Bei, king of the state of Shu about 1,700 years ago. Archeologists say there was no time or money to save thousands of other artifacts that will be submerged. China's leadership stands firmly behind the dam project, conceived 80 years ago by the revolutionary nationalist Sun Yat-sen. But officials have had to crack down on corruption that has dogged the project. And engineers have defended the soundness of the dam despite the discovery of fissures in the 60-foot high structure., located in Yichang in the central province of Hubei."
"Floodwaters in Colorado have left a giant sinkhole in the middle of a major highway in the mountains and hundreds of residents of Vail cleaning up their water- and mud-soaked homes. A combination of high temperatures, runoff from melting snow and thunderstorms caused many rivers and creeks to overflow last week and over the weekend. On Sunday, Bighorn Creek exceeded the capacity of the culvert it channels through under Interstate 70 near Vail and created a sinkhole 20 feet wide and 10 to 20 feet deep. As the creek flowed over its banks, more than 200 residents of East Vail were evacuated overnight. Although residents were able to return to their homes today, 24 miles of I-70, which is the only east-west Interstate across Colorado, will remain closed for days. Vehicles were rerouted to a two-lane highway, and drivers of tractor-trailers were told to detour as far north as Wyoming or as far south as New Mexico to make their deliveries. ''The good thing was that nobody was hurt, no vehicles were damaged,'' said Stacey Stegman, spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Transportation, adding that the extent of the damage to the road and the culvert was unknown. ''Our concern is that, especially with truck traffic, the weight could cause the pavement to collapse.'' Road crews also repaired areas of mudslides and loose rocks that could fall to the Interstate. ''The difficulty is the enormous amount of water,'' Ms. Stegman said. 'It could happen in a number of locations. I think everyone up here recognizes this is one of the difficulties of living in Colorado, where we have such beautiful weather and some extreme situations caused by that weather.'' The rising waters were certainly not bad news to everyone. ''For the next two to three weeks here it's guaranteed oh-my-gosh-this-is-perfect really fun boating,'' said Darryl Bangert, owner of Lakota River Guides in Vail, which offers white-water rafting and Hummer tours. ''If you're unprepared, it can be dangerous or miserable, just like skiing if you're not prepared or experienced. But it's spiking right now, and this runoff is going to be real hard and early with a good, steady flow throughout the summer.'' One kayaker was killed on Saturday in the Cache la Poudre River in northern Colorado, and a canoeist is missing after his boat overturned on the Colorado River on Sunday. But river outfitters interviewed said they did not know whether higher and faster waters were factors. Caught up in a four-year-long drought, many river outfitters in the state have struggled. ''We haven't seen this kind of water in five years,'' said Bob Hamel, president of Arkansas River Tours in Cotopaxi, Colo. Mr. Hamel said there had not been any flooding in southern Colorado where he works."
"With snow on the mountaintops and heavy rain in the forecast, rescue workers said today that hope was fading for finding the remaining victims of the flash floods that may have claimed up to 16 lives on Thursday in the San Bernardino Mountains. ''It's been several days, and our hopes are not high of finding people alive,'' said Chip Patterson, a spokesman for the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. ''We may never find everyone,'' Mr. Patterson added, noting that the washout is five miles long and strewn with refrigerator-size boulders and trees from the October wildfires. So far, 12 bodies have been recovered, including five found on Sunday. The authorities are using cadaver-sniffing dogs, bulldozers, chainsaws and their bare hands in an attempt to find the others. ''We're depending heavily on the dogs,'' Mr. Patterson said. ''The whole power of the flash flood is almost indescribable.'' Today, the bodies of two children were found trapped in debris near the St. Sophia campsite, where most of the victims were spending the Christmas holiday. The authorities said that the bodies of two men and a woman were found nearby buried in mud. Two other bodies were recovered in the same area on Saturday. None of the victims recovered on Sunday had been identified as of early evening. Among those whose bodies have been recovered and identified are Ramon Meza, 29; Jose Pablo Navarro, 11; and his cousin, Ivan Navarro, 13; all of San Bernardino. Also among the dead are Wendy Monzon, 17, and Raquel Monzon, 9, children of the camp's caretaker, Jorge Monzon, who is still missing along with his wife, Carla, and their 6-month-old son. Up to four inches of rain are forecast for Monday, and the authorities have asked residents to take appropriate precautions including voluntary evacuations. ''Our problems are not over,'' said Tracey Martinez, a spokeswoman for the San Bernardino County Fire Department. ''All winter long, we're going to have rock slides and mudslides and flash flooding.'' County officials said they planned to use the emergency broadcast system, air raid sirens and radio and television to warn people of impending danger. Nevertheless, officials said residents should use common sense to protect themselves. ''It's people's responsibility to be ready,'' Ms. Martinez said. ''They should remember that the people who got caught up at the campground had no time to escape.'' The St. Sophia Camp, a Greek Orthodox religious retreat in the Waterman Canyon, had been closed because officials believed it was vulnerable to flash flooding and mudslides since the fall wildfires denuded the canyon walls above it, said Rev. John Bakas, dean of the St. Sophia Cathedral in Los Angeles, which owns the 66-acre retreat. Apparently, Mr. Monzon ignored the church's directive and invited 22 relatives and friends to spend Christmas there. Four inches of rain fell in the mountains on Thursday and the campers at St. Sophia had little warning that a wall of water and mud was on its way. Two cabins were washed away, and all that remains are splintered wood and their concrete foundations. A memorial service was held Sunday afternoon at the Church of God Prophecy in San Bernardino, the parish of some of the victims who are Guatemalan and Mexican immigrants. A trust fund has been established and donations can be sent to the Waterman Canyon Relief Fund. In nearby Devore, two other people were killed at a KOA campground when a flood swept through on Thursday. They have been identified as Janice Stout-Bradley, 60, the campground manager, and Carol Nuss, 57, an insurance adjuster who was in the area to process claims on property from the wildfires."
"Blinding rainstorms danced across the New York City region yesterday afternoon, disrupting the homebound rush with widespread flooding that turned some highways, streets and subway tunnels into running rivers, all but closed the three major airports and left low-lying intersections and basements awash. Accompanied by thunderclaps and spectacular lightning, the downpours -- one to two inches an hour in some areas -- cut visibility to dangerous levels on roads and runways, forced many drivers to crawl or halt, prompted the rerouting of some subway trains and delayed thousands of air travelers. The storms -- blotches on the radar screens of forecasters but curtains of falling water to those caught in them -- moved slowly from west to east, with the heaviest rains, between 3 and 6 p.m., inflicting another soaking on the waterlogged metropolitan area. Some areas were hit harder than others. The National Weather Service said La Guardia Airport had 2.78 inches of rain in three hours, while Newark had 2.48 inches, most of it between 3 and 4 p.m. In northeast New Jersey, the rain came down at nearly two inches an hour, said Nelson Vaz, a meteorologist. Scores of cars and trucks pulled off the major highways in northern and central New Jersey during the height of the storms. Traffic backed up for five or six miles as drivers forded small lakes that covered the roadways. Enormous backups were reported west of the George Washington Bridge. In Westchester County, the Bronx River Parkway was closed by the flooding from Mount Vernon to White Plains, and traffic that spilled over onto Interstate 287 and the Hutchinson River Parkway was bumper to bumper and hardly moving at times, witnesses said. The storms forced numerous flight cancellations and lengthy delays in takeoffs and landings at the major airports, said Tony Ciavolella, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airports. At Newark-Liberty International Airport, he said, outbound flights were delayed up to three hours, while inbound flights were up to 90 minutes late. At Kennedy International Airport, delays for all flights ran up to 90 minutes, while inbound and outbound delays at La Guardia ran up to two hours. Fog rolling in off Flushing Bay had also delayed morning flights at La Guardia. Jim Peters, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said that a lightning bolt struck the control tower at La Guardia at 5:45 p.m., but it had no effect on flight operations. Lightning occasionally strikes control towers since they are the highest points at airports, he noted. Flooding at the Montague Street tunnel under the East River shortly after 5 p.m. prompted the rerouting of N and R trains over the Manhattan Bridge, said Charles Seaton, a spokesman for New York City Transit. Deep water around 79th Street on the West Side prompted the suspension of the No. 1 and 9 trains between 137th Street and Times Square, and the No. 2 and 3 express trains were suspended between 96th Street and Times Square, also about 5 p.m., he said. Mr. Seaton said some No. 2 trains were also rerouted to the Lexington Avenue line between Manhattan and Brooklyn, and trains running under Queens Boulevard were ordered to move at slow speeds because of flooding on the line. ''This is a result of a lot of water coming into the system at once,'' he said. In Paterson, N.J., the police reported a street collapse that damaged several cars, and flooding that left some drivers trapped briefly in their vehicles. ''But everyone was brought out safely, and there were no injuries,'' Lt. Michael Recca said. In Brooklyn, numerous basements were reported flooded in Park Slope, and the intersection of Fourth Avenue and Carroll Street -- always prone to flooding because it is at the base of a small hill -- was awash again. ''I've been living here 66 years, and for 66 years there has been flooding,'' said Marie Mannaruma as she sat in a folding lawn chair on her sidewalk and surveyed sewage and debris left by the flood tide shortly after 5 p.m. But, she added, ''This is the worst I've seen.'' Residents said the intersection flooded twice yesterday, first in the early-morning rains, and later when the torrential rains came down about 4 p.m. The rain submerged a fire hydrant down the block from Mrs. Mannaruma's home, swamped cars in more than three feet of water and left police and fire personnel scrambling to clear the intersection. Anthony DiMonda, the owner of ABC Collision, an auto repair shop on Fourth Avenue at Carroll Street, watched the water rise into his place of business, and then recede. He was miffed. ''This is raw sewage, and a health issue,'' he said. ''It's 2003 already. You'd think they would find a way to correct this problem.'' But Mr. DiMonda was not above a bit of levity. ''I've always wanted waterfront property,'' he said. In Riverdale, in the northwest corner of the Bronx, floodwaters gushed down a slope at 261st Street onto the campus of the College of Mount St. Vincent. Just to the south, a driver on the Henry Hudson Parkway saw rainwater rippling like a series of waterfalls down the western slopes of Fort Tryon and Inwood Hill Parks; a pretty sight, but it flooded one lane of the parkway. Chris Johannesson, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University, said that thunderstorms were typical of the summer months, when warmth rising from the sunlit ground touches clouds laden with moisture. But the storms yesterday were heavier than usual, he said, because the jet stream with its cooler Canadian air has drifted to the south and, over the metropolitan area, run into heavier than normal moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic. While yesterday's rains were heavy in some areas, especially in northern and central New Jersey and in New York City, other areas, including Long Island and much of Connecticut, experienced only light showers. ''You drive a few miles and it won't be raining,'' Mr. Johannesson said. ''A few miles on, you hit pretty heavy downpours.'' For most of the past week, thunderstorms have grumbled over the metropolitan area almost daily, selectively soaking parts of the city and suburbs. And the forecast for much of this week calls for the same. ''The threat of this happening will be around for the next several days,'' Mr. Johannesson said. Correction: August 7, 2003, Thursday A picture caption on Tuesday with an article about rainstorms and flooding in the New York City region misidentified the roadway shown. It was West End Avenue, not 11th."
"As it began to rain again one day this week, Sally Gonzalez, who owns Joyce's Bakery and Restaurant on East Main Street, peered out her store's front window and tried not to let her customers see that she was beginning to shake. ''I thought we were going to flood again,'' Ms. Gonzalez said. As cars drove down Main Street, their wheels splashed water into her establishment. At one point, Main Street was closed for about a half-hour because of the storm water. But it was nothing close to the eight feet of water that inundated this tiny borough in 1999 during Tropical Storm Floyd, when Ms. Gonzalez's business had to shut down for a month to clean up. ''I was very nervous, but I tried to stay calm for my clients, and this time, the water went down very quickly,'' she said. Across the street at Bound Brook One Hour Photo, Tony Cabral keeps several pictures in plastic frames as symbols of his survival. In one of them, taken in 1999, floodwaters reach almost to the traffic lights on Main Street. Another, from 1996, shows his store with two to three feet of water. Each time, Mr. Cabral rebuilt his business. But each time it rains, the fears return. ''We are all desperately trying to survive,'' he said. Tropical Storm Floyd dumped 10 inches of rain in 24 hours in parts of northern and central New Jersey, causing the Raritan River to overflow its banks where it meets the Green Brook in downtown Bound Brook. An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in their ground-floor apartment after refusing to evacuate. It took months for some businesses to clean up and reopen. Some never did. In 1973, when six men died in a flash flood near here, federal and local officials began plans to build the Green Brook Flood Control Project. But the project became a study in bureaucratic foot-dragging over the next two decades. There were federal budget cuts, changes to the plan demanded by Congress, environmental debates, and political feuds about how to parcel out the costs and benefits of the plan. It took the two deaths during Floyd, and an estimated $630 million worth of damage throughout the state, to make everyone come together and push the plan forward. In October 2000, the Army Corps of Engineers broke ground on the $330 million project. ''Out of something bad, something good is finally happening,'' Frank Ryan, the mayor of Bound Brook, said today. The project, which involves dredging, bridge reconstruction and building flood walls and levees, will cover 65 square miles in 13 municipalities and three counties. When the project is finished -- which might not be until 2012 -- it should control severe flooding problems in Bound Brook, Middlesex Borough, Green Brook, North Plainfield and Piscataway. And so, this week, even as rain fell relentlessly, work continued steadily on the project, which, once under way, has proceeded so quickly that some residents have failed to notice how much has been done. A month ago, the Army Corps and state and local politicians held a ribbon-cutting in Bound Brook for a new Lincoln Boulevard bridge that passes over the Green Brook just before it feeds into the Raritan River. The bridge is 11 feet higher than the one it replaced, to accommodate floodwaters, and work is under way to build a new pumping station here. This spot is critical to the flood-control project because it is where the Raritan backed up in 1999, spilling into the Green Brook, which itself overflowed into the lowlands that make up downtown Bound Brook, Middlesex Borough and nearby Manville. As part of the project, 19 homes in Middlesex Borough that were in the flood plain were bought from their owners and demolished. Streams and creeks have been widened and deepened, and riprap material made of stones has been placed along their banks for erosion control. An earthen levee has been built along the banks of the Green Brook on the Bound Brook side, beginning at Billian Legion Park. It then turns west to run along Vosseller Brook. At the point where East Street goes over the brook, workers are building an eight-foot-high steel gate that will move on rollers to form a wall with concrete barriers on either side. The gate will shut off downtown Bound Brook from water in the event of a flood like the one during Floyd. New, wider culverts have been installed where streets cross over streams and brooks. Eventually, downtown Bound Brook will be surrounded on three sides by a levee system to protect it from floodwaters. But that, and much more, remains to be done. ''Even though we're not finished yet, people here already have a higher level of protection than they did during Floyd,'' said Joseph Rossano, project engineer for the Army Corps, as he pointed out where the roller gate will go on East Street. Bradley M. Campbell, the state's commissioner of environmental protection, said the project depended on more than just concrete and steel. Instead of just fortifying areas against flooding with steel, concrete and earthen walls, officials also decided that 31 homes were in areas so prone to flooding, that it made more sense to remove them from harm's way. A voluntary buyout program was offered, and so far, 28 owners have agreed to sell, including the 19 whose homes were already demolished. The vacant land will be turned into parks. ''That better balance of structural and nonstructural features meant that this project avoided some of the environmental objections that typically slow down or stymie flood-control projects,'' Mr. Campbell said. In spite of all the work, some people in Bound Brook are barely aware of the project, and some are still skeptical about how it will work. At Bound Brook One Hour Photo, Tom Fuller, a customer and a longtime resident, was not aware that the Army Corps had even begun its work. ''They've been dragging their feet over there,'' he said. ''They should've been done by now.'' Mr. Fuller, like the store's owner, Mr. Cabral, said people were still spooked by memories of past floods. Mr. Fuller said he left one apartment on Linden Avenue because it flooded so much. ''Every time it rains, I can still picture the trucks driving down the streets, and hearing them shouting out over the bullhorns, 'You have to evacuate,' '' he said. ''If you live here, you have to expect that.'' Other residents and merchants are tired of Bound Brook bearing the label of Flood Town U.S.A. They include Phyllis Pournaras, who has lived here for 30 years and owns Bill's Luncheonette II on Main Street. ''If we had 13 inches of rain in one day, then I'll get nervous,'' Ms. Pournaras said. ''But we'd like to move beyond what happened in '99, and I look forward to the completion of the flood project.''"
"Hurricane Isabel began jabbing the North Carolina coast today, emptying out low-lying areas up to 40 miles inland in expectation of the approaching storm's torrential rains, fierce winds and tidal flooding. Yet by tonight, as rain and wind began buffetting the coast, hundreds of residents stayed behind on the Outer Banks, dining and drinking in a few restaurants, braving the winds along sand dunes, posing for pictures on rickety piers and generally tempting fate. ''Izzy Who?'' someone had spray-painted on plywood covering a store along Highway 12, the beach road that people here fully expect to become an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday. By late tonight winds along the coast reached the force of tropical storms, exceeding 39 miles an hour. The storm is also expected to deliver drenching rains and winds of 60 miles an hour or more to major urban areas far from its center, including Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. Forecasters with the National Hurricane Center said that the hurricane's forward speed had nearly doubled, to 13 m.p.h., this evening and would continue to accelerate as it neared land. They predicted that the storm would strike North Carolina with sustained maximum winds of 105 miles an hour, huge waves, rainfall of 10 inches or more and a tidal surge 7 to 11 feet above normal by late morning or early afternoon on Thursday between Cape Hatteras and Morehead City. Because of the wind's direction, the worst of the storm was expected to be felt northeast of its eye, placing the Outer Banks and mainland areas bordering Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds in greatest danger, experts said. By tonight, more than 150,000 people along the coast had evacuated inland, officials said. Mark Van Sciver, a spokesman for the North Carolina state emergency center, said late last night that mandatory evacuations had been ordered in part or all of 11 counties and that 84 shelters had opened in 28 counties. Low-lying areas of Washington County, along the Albemarle, were reporting some flooding. But for many residents here, hunkering down made sense -- and made for a little excitement. ''Where we going to go?'' asked Eddie Boykin of Powell's Point, who went to the 708-foot pier here to see the surf, a hurricane ritual for him and his wife, Donna. ''I got everything here,'' Mr. Boykin said. ''I got to protect what's mine. If it gets blowed away, I guess I get blowed away too. At least we'll have a beautiful ride.'' In Elizabeth City, 40 miles from the Outer Banks, 12 people were waiting when the Red Cross opened a shelter for 600 people at the state university this afternoon. Phil Park, 77, brought his bag of medicines and a box of chicken from Hardee's. ''I got a mobile home,'' he said. ''I passed by here a couple times and figured it was the thing to do.'' The hurricane should also cause canceled flights. Airports may close because of crosswinds, wet runways and flying debris. Some control towers are forced to close in high winds. At Dulles International outside Washington, ''at 55 miles per hour, they'll abandon the tower,'' said Jeff McAndrews, a spokesman for United Airlines, which has a hub there. William A. Shumann, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said the towers at Reagan National and at Philadelphia and Norfolk, Va., might close because they were vulnerable to flooding. In Virginia, Gov. Mark Warner authorized mandatory evacuations in flood-prone Tidewater areas. Mr. Warner predicted that the storm's effects would be felt for days and urged residents to prepare for prolonged power failures. ''This is going to cause some frightening incidences,'' he said at a news conference. ''It's going to cause some inconveniences.'' Following his order, officials in Virginia Beach, Norfolk, Hampton, Chesapeake and other places near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay ordered more than 70,000 people to move to higher ground and opened shelters in schools. The officials urged people to depart quickly because bridges and tunnels that provide escape routes will be closed when winds exceed 59 miles an hour, possibly by midday Thursday. Early this afternoon, many roads leading to the river crossings were jammed. Mr. Warner and local officials warned that residents would probably be better off finding shelter closer to home, rather than fleeing inland, where they might move directly into the storm's path. ''The traditional evacuation routes take you to Richmond,'' Bob Batcher, a spokesman for Norfolk, said. ''But that's where the storm's heading.'' Craig Blessing followed the governor's advice. Mr. Blessing, 50, a plumbing contractor, planned to close his house three blocks from the ocean in Virginia Beach and drive 25 miles to a relative's house in Chesapeake. There, he still may face power failures and falling trees, but flooding is less likely. ''It's a choice of two evils,'' he said. ''I'll take the falling trees.'' In Norfolk, workers moved animals from the zoo to stormproof buildings. Hotels and businesses stocked bottled water and laid sandbags in lobbies. On the Virginia Beach Boardwalk, businesses seemed to take the storm threat seriously, boarding up windows and piling merchandise on high shelves. After it passes northeastern North Carolina, the hurricane's center is projected to veer toward Richmond and cut north through central Virginia, western Maryland, eastern West Virginia and into Pennsylvania. In Washington, officials said they might shut the subway and bus systems because of concerns that winds would blow riders onto tracks or in front of buses. The House of Representatives ended its business for the week today, with lawmakers saying they wanted to catch flights home. The Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, called off votes for the rest of the week. Forecasters said a combination of factors could still make Isabel, now a Category 2 hurricane, more dangerous than storms of similar strength. Heavy summer rains have swollen rivers and streams that empty into Chesapeake Bay. The hurricane will probably push water northward in the bay, flushing it into the rivers and causing flooding inland, they said. Many tree roots have been loosened by the heavy rains, making them easy prey to strong winds, the forecasters said. Utilities across the region have recruited workers from other states in preparation for widespread power failures. At Outer Banks Hospital in Nags Head, officials said they decided to keep the emergency room open when the hurricane was downgraded to Category 2 on Tuesday. Twenty-four staff members are to remain through the storm, behind hurricane-resistant storm shutters. Along the beach in Kill Devil Hills tonight, Rebecca Maberry said she had stayed to avoid evacuating to the wrong place and getting stuck in the storm. She also worried about leaving her animals. ''How are we going to walk the dogs tomorrow?'' she asked a friend, Sean Kelly. ''We'll just float them out the top window,'' he said."
"Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, stopping to inspect hurricane damage in the island nation of Grenada, said Wednesday that the Bush administration had asked Congress for an additional $50 million to provide relief to Caribbean countries, bringing the total pledged for the region to $113.3 million. Mr. Powell met with Prime Minister Keith C. Mitchell of Grenada at the airport on the southern tip of the island and then went for a quick tour of relief efforts. Before landing, his plane circled the island to see a vast expanse of damaged homes and ruined farmlands and forests. ''Clearly this country has been hit with a devastating tragedy that has affected its infrastructure, its means of income and its people psychologically,'' Mr. Powell told reporters at the airport. ''But Grenadians are a resilient people, and there is no doubt in my mind that they will spring back.'' Mr. Mitchell called the secretary's visit a ''special occasion'' because of his ''personal touch and presence.'' He praised Mr. Powell for listening intently and added: ''You lifted me. I've been lifted, and I'm pretty sure you have lifted every single Grenadian.'' Mr. Powell, who stopped here on his way back to the United States from a visit to Brazil, had said earlier that he had considered stopping in Haiti, also damaged by Hurricane Ivan, but that Haiti was still struggling from the damage and would be overburdened by such a visit. Haiti is also experiencing riots that State Department officials said had made a visit difficult. Mr. Powell took note of the unusual relationship between the United States and Grenada, a lush mountainous island whose main industries are tourism and the production of nutmeg, both of which have been set back, according to relief officials. He said he had last visited the island with President Ronald Reagan in 1984, a year after the United States sent in forces to restore order after a power struggle resulted in the killing of the country's prime minister. Caribbean nations at the time appealed for American intervention, which quickly became notable for reflecting the Reagan administration's muscular opposition to Communist governments in the region. Aid for Grenada and for the Caribbean has come in phases, starting with an emergency shipment of $13.3 million in food, medicine, construction materials and other supplies to the region, about a quarter of it for Grenada itself. President Bush later attached a $50 million request for the Caribbean to a larger package of help for Florida, Louisiana and other states in the South hit by the rolling series of storms this summer and fall. Still another $50 million was requested by the White House on Tuesday, Mr. Powell said. ''Grenada has been hit the hardest, so you can expect your assistance will be significant,'' the secretary told Mr. Mitchell, adding that help was needed not simply to repair homes and schools but also to restore the economic infrastructure of the country. He said experts had begun discussing ''creative suggestions'' for how Grenada could diversify its agriculture output after the destruction of its nutmeg groves, which could take five to seven years to restore. Officials said later that it might be so difficult to rebuild its nutmeg output that Grenada should consider trying to grow other products, like flowers. About 30 percent of the island's economy is based on tourism, including cruise ships. Nutmeg accounts for 10 percent of Grenada's economic output, but it is a labor-intensive industry, employing 8,000 families. Correction: October 12, 2004, Tuesday An article on Thursday about Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's visit to Grenada, where he announced an increase in American aid to Caribbean countries damaged by hurricanes, misstated the date of his previous visit, accompanying President Ronald Reagan. His office says it was 1986; at the time, Mr. Powell was a military adviser to Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger."
"A powerful typhoon roared through Japan's main islands on Wednesday, killing at least 30 people and injuring more than 250 in mudslides and flash floods, Kyodo News said. With giant waves destroying breakwaters, 40 more people were missing. Pounding Japan just 10 days after the ''strongest typhoon in a decade'' hit Tokyo, this latest tropical storm is the 10th typhoon to strike Japan's main islands this year, breaking a record of six. While power failures affected about one million people on Wednesday, many Japanese bunkered down in their homes, watching television reporting of a storm called ''Tokage,'' or ''Lizard'' in Japanese. Television images showed flash floods rising to car windows, powerful winds knocking over trees, and landslides wiping out houses. Much of Japan's highly efficient transportation system ground to a halt on Wednesday afternoon as airlines canceled 937 flights, affecting 127,000 passengers, and bullet train service was suspended between Tokyo and Osaka, the busiest line. Powerful waves beached two oceangoing freighters. In Nagoya, high winds and whipping rain forced organizers to cancel all events for the 11th World Conference on Intelligent Transport Systems. The Toyota Motor Corporation halted work at 12 auto factories on Wednesday, Kyodo reported. Given the pummeling series of storms, Wednesday's deaths had a sad familiarity. A 61-year-old man was blown off his roof while doing repairs. A 68-year-old fisherman was snatched by waves as he was trying to secure his boat. A 31-year-old man drowned when his car was swept into a rain-swollen river. A family of three was killed when waves destroyed its coastal home. Japan's first nine typhoons this year killed 102 people, injured 1,991 and left 13 missing, according to Japan's Fire and Disaster Management Agency. The storms have caused $4 billion in damages, according to insurance estimates published in Japanese newspapers. As the storm started to swirl through Tokyo, Japanese members of the environmental group Greenpeace held an outdoor news conference in front of city's trendy Shibuya train station. Members asked Japan to meet its commitments to reduce emissions of gases blamed for global warming. They also asked that the government look into possible links between this year's bad weather and global climate change. The number of typhoons to strike Japan this year is the highest since Japan started keeping records in 1551, Nobutaka Mannoji, director of National Typhoon Center of Japan's Meteorology Agency, said in a recent interview. ''We cannot say anything about whether the unusual activeness of the typhoon phenomenon this year is related to the global warming,'' he said by telephone. ''Higher sea surface temperature is one important element for the birth of typhoon, but there are other elements.''"
"THE destructive rainstorms visited upon Westchester County over the last two months by four Florida hurricanes provide an uncomfortable reminder of Tropical Storm Floyd, which hit here five years ago, on Sept. 16, 1999. While New York City was largely spared the worst that night, nearly a foot of rain fell on the county within a 24-hour period. The result was severe, widespread damage, especially in northern areas, where the landscape was transmogrified by floating cars, downed trees, collapsed railroad embankments and impassable roadways. Some experts claimed at the time that a storm of such magnitude would be very unlikely to recur in New York for another 250 years. But judging from the recent weather, that prediction may have been a little rosy. In fact, according to Gary Conte, a warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Upton, N.Y.: ''The New York area experiences some impact from tropical storms every 4 years, and from hurricanes every 10 years.'' In the five years since Floyd, one of its few positive results is an improved county emergency service. When the storm hit in 1999, there was no major coordinating group, according to County Executive Andrew J. Spano. Each municipality had to deal with its own emergencies, he said, adding that the problem at the time forced him to rely for most of his storm information on Westchester's cable news channel. ''Floyd was a big lesson in what we needed to do to enhance emergency management in Westchester County,'' Mr. Spano said. Anthony W. Sutton, commissioner of the Department of Emergency Services, described the newly integrated group as putting ''fire and emergency medical services and emergency management under the same roof.'' ''I use the analogy of the wedding planner for emergency management,'' he added. ''We bring everything together and make things happen.'' Yet the other lessons to be learned in the county from what could be called ''Floyd 101'' are: a) that because of prohibitive cost, almost nothing gets rebuilt sturdily enough to withstand a comparable storm, and b) that no one -- whether private homeowner, business or municipality -- recovers 100 percent of a storm loss. Just about every city, town and village in Westchester County incurred some storm damage from Floyd, starting with minor amounts in Dobbs Ferry and ranging to more than $3 million in Peekskill and Ossining, according to a list compiled by Dennis Michalski, a spokesman for the New York State Emergency Management Office. Indeed, Westchester was one of 13 New York counties declared federal disaster areas, which enabled municipalities, businesses, and homeowners to become eligible for federal relief. Ultimately, Westchester municipalities were reimbursed about $14 million by the Federal Emergency Management Agency for damages; local businesses received $2.3 million from the agency, and homeowners got about $1.6 million, according to Barbara J. Ellis, a spokeswoman for the agency. It was the biggest chunk of federal disaster assistance provided to Westchester County since FEMA was founded about 25 years ago, Ms. Ellis said. In Cortlandt, the final check for a federal reimbursement of $886,000 arrived just this summer -- one of about 10 separate payments, said the town controller, Glenn Cestaro. In the recent spate of storms, however, Cortlandt was hit again, said Linda D. Puglisi, the town supervisor. Several of its major roadways were submerged. ''We have drainage issues,'' is how Ms. Puglisi described the problems, noting that post-Floyd improvements had not prevented flooding. Parts of Peekskill, which has a century-old infrastructure, still flood during rainstorms, although the areas repaired after Floyd have held so far, according to David Greener, director of city services. The city has received payments totaling $500,000, although it has been promised an additional $2 million by the emergency management agency. ''I've been approved, but I haven't seen the money yet,'' said Mr. Greener, adding, ''I don't want to jeopardize the money.'' Five years ago during Floyd, Mr. Greener took a video camera out in the rainstorm and taped the surging rainwater just as it buckled and collapsed more than 200 feet of Central Avenue. The site remained closed for two years, he said, with repair delays related to engineering problems. Today, the completed culvert under the repaired Central Avenue roadway is a giant rectangle 14 feet by 5 -- roomy enough for a short family to hold a tail-gate party inside. It was designed not to interfere with the electric lines, gas mains and sewer lines nearby. If Floyd happened again today, with a full moon and at high tide, Mr. Greener said, the new culvert would probably hold -- but the runoff it would spew into Water Street, which runs perpendicular to Central Avenue, wreaking havoc there. In Ossining, Floyd-related flooding was so dramatic that Gov. George E. Pataki, Senator Charles S. Schumer and other officials visited, turning the village into a sound bite site for local television news. Ultimately, Ossining incurred about $3.56 million in damages. It has been reimbursed for about $3.16 million of that, said Lynn M. McCrum, the village manager. The day Floyd hit, Mr. McCrum recalled, the normally tame Sparta and Kil Brooks flooded, and he watched in disbelief as a car, crushed and compacted by its trip downstream, floated toward the Hudson River. The lower Kil Brook, where the car eventually landed, exploded out of a large culvert and flooded the railroad tracks -- where, Mr. McCrum said, it shut down the Hudson Line of Metro-North. Despite extensive repairs at that site, he added, the water has risen nearly as high several times during the recent storms. Repairing Floyd's damage in Ossining required 54 separate projects, so detailed and complicated in nature that, Mr. McCrum said, he is still working on the FEMA applications five years later. The hurricane doled $2.8 million in losses out on Metro-North, from flooded tracks and washed-out embankments in Ossining, as well as in Golden's Bridge, Purdy's and Scarborough, said Marjorie Anders, a railroad spokeswoman. No amount of planning or preparation can prevent such problems, she said, but she did cite standard company procedures -- like getting chainsaws sharpened and fueled, and readying shuttle buses. Nearly all of the state-controlled parkways in Westchester flooded during Floyd, causing about $2.8 million in damage, said Robert A. Dennison, regional director of the New York State Department of Transportation. But then again, officials say, parkway flooding is so frequent that most county residents would be surprised if it didn't occur. Mr. Dennison, who says he is fatalistic about the problem, points out that the roadways' very names indicate why they are so susceptible: the Saw Mill River Parkway, the Hutchinson River Parkway, the Sprain Brook Parkway and the Taconic Parkway were all built on river channels. Because the roads are surrounded by heavy development, Mr. Dennison explained, they fill up like plugged bathtubs during storms. Little else can be expected of an area ''comprised of paving and roofs,'' he said. The way to fix the problem: divert all the extra water to empty land near the parkways -- which ''you could do in Idaho,'' Mr. Dennison concluded, ''but not here.'' Yet despite these inherent problems, infrastructure systems like highways have to function, and so are repaired after natural disasters. The same is not true of private businesses. Ms. Ellis, the FEMA spokeswoman, said that although her agency usually pays about 75 percent of the cost for municipal storm losses, it pays smaller, and varying, amounts for private business and individual losses. One of those individuals, Salvatore Credendino of Ossining, says his company, Highland Transmissions, has recovered less than 20 percent of the $3 million loss it suffered in Floyd. That night three years ago, surging storm waters sluiced through the property, turning two buildings into three. Today the damage is still glaring: one unrepaired structure on the site remains open to the elements -- a gaping maw with wires and cables dangling. Mr. Credendino, who says he still gets nervous every time it rains, recalled that in the middle of Floyd's onslaught he rushed to his site, a three-quarter-acre property that dips down from Route 9. The business is adjacent to the Kil Brook -- usually a small trickle of water that feeds into the Hudson. But he arrived to find the buildings enisled in about 12 feet of water. He saw equipment, tools and car parts floating by, along with a chunk of one building, which had collapsed into the filthy rising tide. ''I'm surprised we managed to pull through it,'' he said in a recent interview at the site, ''but we're still struggling.'' Among the uncounted Westchester homeowners who suffered losses in Floyd, fewer than 1 percent had flood insurance, according to information provided by the emergency management agency. That number, incidentally, remains about the same today -- partly because even the most deluxe homeowner's insurance policy does not cover storm-related flooding. That must be bought separately from the National Flood Insurance Program. In Peekskill that night, the torrent in storm drains sent manhole covers on neighborhood streets shooting into the air. Among the basements that became wading pools, or worse, there was one in Sleepy Hollow in which the water exploded up through a concrete floor. ''The water came up through the slop sink and it geysered through the concrete floor like Yellowstone,'' said the homeowner, explaining that she did not want to be identified because other people now live in the house. By the end of the day, the family's basement was filled nearly to the ceiling. They had to replace the washer, the dryer and the boiler, not to mention the floor, she said, and they also waterproofed the basement -- which has nevertheless flooded several times since. Elsewhere in Sleepy Hollow that night, recalled Lawrence P. Doyle, a resident, he helped neighbors bail out the lower level of their home, where two sump pumps working at full speed were being outpaced by the storm. After moving the washing machine's hose from the sink to the window, Mr. Doyle bailed water into the machine and set it on spin cycle. The extra water spewed into the back yard. At another home, he said, he remembers building a channel out of area rugs, so water flowing in at the front door could be diverted out the back. The situation was little better at Philipsburg Manor, a historic edifice in Sleepy Hollow, which suffered $4.1 million in damage, according to Waddell W. Spillman, president of Historic Hudson Valley in Tarrytown. He remembers watching the property's historic mill bridge as it was hit by a flow of gardening equipment, barbecue grills, parts of swing sets and other debris borne forward on the turbulent Pocantico River. The detritus ended up building a makeshift dam that diverted the river water onto the grounds. ''All of this junk came down the Pocantico River and wedged up at the bridge,'' said Mr. Spillman, adding that the ensuing flood undermined the foundation of both the reconstructed mill and the Manor House, which was built in 1693. State and federal emergency funds paid $2.1 million toward the renovations, along with an additional $1.5 million in grants, and the rest in private donations, according to a spokeswoman, Rachel Carr. ''The day of the flood,'' Mr. Spillman said, ''we went through stages of grief, beginning with total shock. Later, we were equally stunned by dozens of people who materialized from the neighborhood and community to help out.'' Two ponds on the site have since been dredged, Mr. Spillman said, although the work is not yet finished. In addition, concrete walls were built underground to protect the buildings' foundations. ''We hope to leave things in better shape for the next Floyd,'' he said. That may be about the best Westchester can hope for, said Mr. Dennison of the Transportation Department, emphasizing the near-impossibility of achieving true protection. ''Is it a prudent investment of public money to solve something that might happen two times in 250 years?'' he asked. ''The money is more well spent fixing something that will probably happen more frequently.'' He did acknowledge, however, that fast and easy repairs can sometimes hold their own dangers. ''Everybody has a tendency to do the quick fix,'' he said, adding, ''We have to keep local government focused on doing permanent repairs.'' Meteorology Fans, Take Note THE last six weeks were particularly Floydlike, according to Jerome S. Thaler, a weather buff who volunteers for the National Weather Service. September 2004 was the fifth-wettest month in Westchester since 1860, said Mr. Thaler, who has run the weather station in Yorktown Heights for 40 years. The county got 13.25 inches of rain last month, about the same amount as September 1999, which registered 13.6 inches, he said. As for the day that Hurricane Floyd struck Westchester County -- after it had been downgraded to a tropical storm -- Mr. Thaler calls it ''the single wettest day on record.'' The county got 11 inches of rain during that 24-hour period, he said, although in some areas it may have been closer to 15 or 17 inches. Weather records do vary, though, depending on one's location in Westchester County, as the area includes two distinct climate regions. The National Weather Service describes the southern part of the county -- everything below Interstate 287 -- as being in the coastal climate zone, which includes New York City and Long Island. The northern part of Westchester, above Interstate 287, belongs to the large Hudson Valley climate zone, which includes Putnam, Dutchess, Rockland, Columbia, Saratoga and Rensselaer Counties, as well as parts of seven others. On weather issues, Mr. Thaler considers Interstate 287 ''the waistline'' bisecting Westchester's 450 square miles. The hottest day in Westchester County, as recorded at the Westchester County Airport, was 102 degrees Fahrenheit, on July 4, 1966, according to records provided by the Northeast Regional Climate Center. The coldest day: Feb. 11, 1979, when the thermometer dipped to minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit. But those numbers only go back to 1948, when the airport opened. Westchester"
"ACCORDING to the Insurance Information Institute in Manhattan, about 11 million homes in the United States are in areas highly susceptible to flooding. And while homeowners' insurance does not cover losses caused by floods, such coverage is available through the National Flood Insurance Program. But only one in four homeowners in flood-prone areas buys flood insurance. ''People tend to think that the risk of flooding for structures in a flood zone is about the same as the risk of fire,'' said Jeanne Salvatore, a spokeswoman for the institute. But according to a Federal Emergency Management Agency analysis, Ms. Salvatore said, over the life of a 30-year mortgage, a property in an area with a high risk of flooding would have a 26 percent chance of being flooded, compared with a 1 percent chance of being involved in a fire. ''Ninety percent of all natural disasters in this country involve flooding,'' Ms. Salvatore said. Butch Kinerney, a spokesman for the federal agency, said that ''everyone lives in a flood zone -- it's just a question of whether you live in a low-, moderate- or high-risk area.'' Areas that have the highest risk, Mr. Kinerney said, are designated Special Flood Hazard Areas. Those with a low to moderate risk of flooding are called Non-Special Flood Hazard Areas. Usually, he said, when someone buys a home in a Special Flood Hazard Area, the mortgage lender will require flood insurance. But just because a house is in a Non-Special Flood Hazard area does not mean flood insurance is unnecessary. About 25 percent of floods occur in low and moderate flood hazard zones, Mr. Kinerney said. ''You don't have to live near water to be at risk for flooding,'' he said, explaining that unusually heavy rainfall can cause flash floods and mud slides just about anywhere. He said that homeowners can determine their zone by checking the federal government's flood insurance rate maps, which are available on the agency's Web site, www.floodsmart.gov. Mr. Kinerney said that if a community participates in the National Flood Insurance Program -- about 20,000 communities do -- homeowners and renters there can buy flood insurance from agents representing about 90 companies. (If a community is not in the program, residents cannot buy flood insurance.) Jack DeCicco, a property and casualty underwriting consultant for State Farm Insurance in Bloomington, Ill., said that flood insurance premiums are based on the zone, with the highest rates for homes in coastal areas and along rivers, lakes and streams. ''The annual premium for homes in a Special Flood Hazard Area can range from $500 to $5,000,'' he said, depending on the zone. He added that lower premiums are available for homes in other areas. The annual premium for a $200,000 policy with $25,000 in contents coverage for a home in a low- to moderate flood risk area would be about $300, he said. The maximum dwelling policy anywhere is $250,000. Owners and renters can insure personal property for up to $100,000. Mr. DeCicco noted that insurance for the structure is ''replacement cost'' -- covering the cost of replacing the original structure with a similar one. Coverage for contents is provided on an ''actual cash value'' basis, counting depreciation. There is one catch for homeowners who decide to buy flood insurance only after hearing that a particularly bad storm is headed their way. ''There is a 30-day waiting period before the policy takes effect,'' Mr. DeCicco said. YOUR HOME"
"ON rainy days, as residents along the swollen Delaware River have come to see, the flotsam of life consists of sodden luggage, wrecked bicycles, logs, liberated lawn chairs, propane tanks, porches and other bits of backyard debris. But when the Delaware flooded two weeks ago -- fed by the last gasps of Hurricane Ivan to become the river's most destructive flood in eight years and a disaster comparable to its historic flooding in 1955 -- it washed in other and more surprising arrivals. Portable toilets popped up across the landscape on both the New Jersey and Pennsylvania sides, the result of swamped municipal sewage systems unable to handle the surge. River waters crested at more than 23 feet in Trenton, poured into the State House and closed state offices. To the north, the cascade passing through Phillipsburg was the third-highest measured in the past 100 years and carried a house beneath the Phillipsburg-Easton bridges. Damages to buildings and roads on both states' banks was extensive, leading to pleas for immediate federal disaster relief. Even so, most surprising has been the reaction -- or lack of it -- by federal officials. Only a day into the flooding, on Sept. 19, Pennsylvania was granted aid by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help in the recovery of 46 of its counties, spanning from the Delaware to the state's western edges, which suffered an estimated $180 million in property damage. Accordingly, on Sept. 20, Governor McGreevey also appealed to the federal agency to provide relief for four counties in New Jersey -- Mercer, Warren, Sussex and Hunterdon -- and last week was still waiting for a reply. Total damages in New Jersey have reached $33 million, according to an assessment by the state Office of Emergency Management. ''It's very infuriating and distressing down here,'' said Bonnie-Marie A. Dakis, the deputy municipal clerk for Harmony Township, in Warren County, a town where waters deluged 148 houses and residents were still mopping up in recent days. Continuing rain falling throughout the week did not help matters. Ruined mattresses, furniture and other items sat in piles before the houses on Goat Farm Road, where someone had posted a sign, ''We don't need sightseers, we need workers.'' ''It is not a time for politics or games,'' said Ms. Dakis, giving voice to the accusation of political preferences in play for Pennsylvania, considered a crucial swing state in the presidential election next month, heard along the river. ''These people on this side are in the same predicament.'' For some residents and state officials, mostly Democrats, the assumption has been that the Bush administration is turning a cold shoulder to New Jersey's disaster petition because the heavily Democratic state -- recent polls notwithstanding -- is expected to go for John Kerry. But Lea Anne McBride, a spokeswoman for the emergency management agency in Washington, said the state's request was ''in process'' and had not necessarily been denied. With the descent of Hurricane Jeanne on Florida last week, the agency has been particularly hard-pressed with disaster petitions, Ms. McBride added. Last week, the Bush administration proposed an additional $7.1 billion to rebuild Florida -- also considered a key state in the election -- on top of earlier aid requests for slightly more than $5 billion. ''We have to do our preliminary damage assessment for New Jersey,'' said Ms. McBride. ''We are working through the request and we certainly try to turn these around.'' Yet others still interpret partisan motivations behind the delay. ''Why does this not surprise me?'' asked State Senator Shirley K. Turner, a Democrat of Mercer County, whose constituency includes Trenton and Ewing Township, two places where floodwaters caused some residents to evacuate their houses. ''It is the political season,'' said Ms. Turner, nearly coining a slogan with her words ''Pennsylvania is a battleground state. We haven't gotten satisfaction and I guess New Jersey will have to wait.'' Assemblyman W. Reed Gusciora, a Democrat of Trenton, pushed the point even further, likening the lack of disaster aid to the apportionment of Homeland Security money. Mr. Gusciora said that New Jersey had ranked ''eighth or ninth'' in the nation for the amount of federal dollars it receives for homeland security, even with its proximity to the terrorist target of New York City. ''If the Bush administration will play with Homeland Security aid,'' he said, ''then it's likely they'll play with who gets the disaster aid.'' The state's two Democratic senators Jon S. Corzine and Frank R. Lautenberg, have written to President Bush requesting federal aid to help pay for the flood. Governor McGreevey declared a state of emergency and sent his own letter to Mr. Bush, asking for ''disaster unemployment assistance, crisis counseling, public assistance, hazard mitigation and Small Business Administration disaster loans'' to resuscitate the four riverside counties. Yet the governor stopped short of mentioning political motivations. Juliet Johnson, a spokeswoman for Mr. McGreevey, had only this to say about the situation: ''As of now, FEMA has not responded. Certainly, the governor is disappointed. There are families out there struggling to get back on their feet.'' In the flooded counties, Republicans have resisted the notion of partisanship, and suggested that the McGreevey administration's tardiness in recognizing the disaster and applying to federal officials were possible reasons for the emergency agency's delayed response. Asked if questions of national politics were blocking relief, state Senator Leonard Lance, a Republican of Hunterdon County, said: ''I hope not. There should be absolutely no partisanship about this issue.'' Then, noting that rural Sussex, Warren and Hunterdon counties tend to be known as Republican strongholds in an overwhelmingly Democratic state, Mr. Lance added, ''We expect the federal government to grant our request as quickly as possible.'' Another Republican, Assemblyman Guy R. Gregg of Flanders, in Sussex County, blamed Mr. McGreevey for being ''somewhat slow on the uptake'' in reporting the urgency of the flood. ''I was told,'' said Mr. Gregg, ''that, as a state, we were not as expeditious as Pennsylvania in our application. But it's not a question of what the decision will be -- FEMA will respond. It does appear that New Jersey could have gotten a faster dollar.'' And Assemblywoman Allison Littell McHose, a Republican of Sparta, also in Sussex County, said the federal response had been appropriate and that ''when you measure the damages, Pennsylvania got harder hit and had more more damages.'' Ms. McHose concluded: ''I don't see a political aspect to this situation.'' Nor did the rising waters of the Delaware. In New Jersey, the flood damaged 844 houses and 47 apartments, for an estimated loss of $18.7 million, according to the state's figures. Damages to roads were estimated to be about $7.5 million, in addition to effects on utilities, parks and public buildings. No lives were reported lost on either side of the river. Warren County sustained the most widespread destruction of property and farm crops. Sussex County, where the Delaware's riverbanks are for the most part lightly populated, reported the least. And yet, in Hunterdon County, the downtown section of Lambertville was awash in floodwaters, as was New Hope, Pa., right across the river. Both towns are enclaves for restaurants, shops and art galleries, some of which were still closed last week after the waters receded. In Phillipsburg, situated near the point where Interstate 78 crosses the Delaware, the river shut down a sewage pumping station for two days and caused $100,000 in damages to a youth recreation building, said Mayor Harry L. Wyant. But for the most part Phillipsburg was protected by several steep stone bluffs on which the town was built. ''We were somewhat spared,'' acknowledged Mr. Wyant. ''But below and above us, the towns were not as fortunate. We see all the criteria in place for federal aid.'' To the north in Belvidere, another significant river town, the Delaware's rising was joined by the flooding of the Pequest River, which runs through the town to join the larger river. Mayor Charles J. Liegel, Sr., said that 10 houses were badly damaged, adding that about 20 other houses had flooded basements and that the effects were more dire than the disaster of 1996, when ice floes holding back the flow of the Delaware River caused another memorable flood. ''We have big-rig trouble out here,'' said Mr. Wyant, before pausing. ''I'm trying to get my people the help they deserve, and FEMA says they can't do anything without a decree from above. I'd hate to think that politics is deciding this.'' Nearby Belvidere, the river also overran parts of Knowlton and White Township. But at no point along the 100 miles or so of flooding were conditions more desperate than in Harmony Township, where last week there was a marked discord among the more than 140 houses drying out. Inner spoils of the houses were jumbled in piles by the roadsides, as residents living next to the river reported near-total losses. Ms. Dakis, the town's deputy clerk, and others are seeking federal aid to help pay for temporary housing as well as low-interest loans to begin repairs, although some residents also have private flood insurance. Fire trucks from the local department traveled from house to house to pump out silt-filled basements. On River Edge Lane, the houses were being gutted of their walls and insulation and the trees still carried the flood's high-water mark. Most dwellings bore symbols spray-painted on exterior walls -- the sign that state police had navigated the street by boat and checked for stranded survivors. Ms. Dakis noted that 450 people in Harmony were displaced by the storm. At the home of Nadine Shandor, a mental-health counselor, the waters stood at six feet in the living room. Ms. Shandor's back deck floated away and now leans against the house next door. She intends to move her house farther away from the riverbank. ''My propane tank ended up in Burlington County,'' she said, before declaring, ''We're staying. The flood made everyone's resolve that much stronger.'' Along Harmony's Goat Farm Road, the devastation was also in view. Stephanie Wydner, a retired teacher, was piling up furniture that she said had been handed down in her family. In the aftermath of the flood, Ms. Wydner discovered fish swimming in the basement. The river's waters even carried away a steel plate covering the valve of her drinking well. '' ''This was the first time in my life that I've seen all of these men, tough and strong guys, cry,'' she said. Solutions for taming the Delaware's flooding have seemed about as frustrating. A federal proposal to dam the upper reaches of the river -- the so-called Tocks Island project -- was dropped in the early 1990's, after environmentalists pointed out that it would corrupt Philadelphia's supply of drinking water. While the project was intended to control the river, it would probably have allowed salt water from Delaware Bay to advance upriver, fouling the city's water intakes. As it now flows, the Delaware's main stem runs unfettered and without dams for 330 miles, from Hancock, N.Y., dividing and defining New Jersey and Pennsylvania before rolling into the sea. One environmentalist, Jeff Tittel, director of the Sierra Club of New Jersey, has advocated a more complex approach to lessening flood damages. While acknowledging the difficulties, Mr. Tittek argues for moving houses and buildings back from the river, removing outdated dams on tributaries and pursuing open-space policies statewide. Open spaces and wetlands, he reasons, are areas that allow rainwater to percolate down into the soil, rather than to rapidly run off and raise a swelling river. ''Even now, we're still building in floodplains,'' said Mr. Tittel, who observed the recent flood from a lawn chair at his house in Lambertville. ''Even now, we're building parking lots on stream banks, creating things that make waters run off faster and do more damage.'' Maya van Rossum, an environmental lawyer and the Delaware Riverkeeper -- a sort of personification of public efforts of preserve the purity of the river -- has taken Mr. Tittel's suggestions and run with them. ''Every time we have a flood like this one,'' said Ms. van Rossum, who is based in Washington Crossing, Pa., ''there's a lesson to be learned.'' She is pushing for voluntary buyouts of private property along the Delaware and a permanent restoration of the river's basin, a notion seen by many homeowners and taxpayers as farfetched. Still, the Riverkeeper is not easily contained. ''After every flood event, we have to invest for people to rebuild,'' Ms. van Rossum explained. ''The public is literally buying the same houses many times over. That's an expensive undertaking in itself, when you are also paying to repair roads and bridges and supply emergency services.'' She looked at it this way: ''All of the options are expensive. We want to move people out of harm's way and keep people out of harm in the future. Buying their property is the best way.'' Given the regularity of flooding on the Delaware, the question remains as to why people continue to build so close to the river. Outside of Belvidere last week, Jeffrey Bugge methodically raked gravel and jetsam from the grounds around King Cole Grove, a restaurant and unofficial landmark on Route 46 that has been run by his family since the 1920's. The building sits on a bluff above the river, with views of rocks, greenery and small islands upstream and down. Mr. Bugge has lived through many spates, many floods, including the latest, which closed the restaurant for a week. ''It's a beautiful site,'' he said, returning to his raking. ''This is the price of being here.'' New Jersey Editors' Note: October 5, 2004, Tuesday An article in the New Jersey section on Sunday reported concerns among residents and elected officials about the delay in a federal government response to Gov. James E. McGreevey's request for disaster support after the recent flooding along the Delaware River. On Friday, after the section had gone to press, the White House issued a declaration making businesses and residents in Warren, Sussex, Hunterdon and Mercer Counties eligible for loans and assistance."
"From Trinidad to Tallahassee, Fla., tropical storms have ravaged the Caribbean basin, exacting a multibillion-dollar toll on housing, schools, hospitals, roads and sewage systems. Most of the casualties were in Haiti. But almost no community escaped unscathed. In Grenada, half of the population is now homeless, the famed nutmeg groves flattened, the power plants wrecked. The tourism industry that was the island's lifeblood could take years to recover. Many other islands -- including Tobago, Jamaica and Grand Cayman -- also suffered. The biggest killer in natural disasters is poverty. The same hurricane tides that flood houses in Florida sweep away entire neighborhoods in places like Gonaïves, Haiti. And while survivors need places to live, simply rebuilding their tin-roofed shacks in flood plains guarantees they will suffer again. Better planning, and more focused foreign aid, can help even poor nations reduce the loss of life and property from natural disasters. Compare the consequences of the storms in the two countries that share the island of Hispaniola. In the Dominican Republic, which has invested in hurricane shelters and emergency evacuation networks, the death toll was fewer than 10, as compared to an estimated 2,000 in Haiti. And Cuba's proven ability to survive hurricanes with few casualties -- Ivan claimed no lives there because two million people were swiftly moved out of harm's way -- is a testament both to the value of disaster response planning and the need for it throughout the Caribbean. According to climatologists, vulnerable coastal communities should be prepared for greater erosion and more severe floods in the future. Poor countries need help to rebuild and to better protect themselves against future such calamities. The United Nations is now beginning appeals for emergency humanitarian aid for Grenada and Haiti to provide food, temporary shelter and basic health care. But long-term development assistance in the Caribbean from agencies like mine, as well as from donors like the United States, must focus on reducing the destructive impact of these storms. Virtually every school, road, hospital or housing settlement destroyed in Grenada by Hurricane Ivan or in Haiti by Hurricane Jeanne was financed with foreign assistance. Reconstruction often occurs with such haste that countries end up with even greater exposure to future hurricanes. But housing developments can be sited and designed to avoid the worst damage. In an effort to promote better long-term planning, the United Nations Development Program early this year evaluated disaster preparedness in scores of nations. It showed Haitians were 100 times more likely to die in an equivalent storm than Dominicans. In the storms that hit last week in Gonaïves, flash floods occurred in just a few hours because upstream terrain has long since been stripped of forests and topsoil. The magnitude of the destruction in Haiti and Grenada underscores the need for vulnerable island states to develop policies that will enable them to withstand these storms. And from the international development community, they deserve not just more aid, but smarter aid. Op-Ed Contributor Julia Taft is assistant administrator of the United Nations Development Program."
"For the past two days, Ricot Dupuy, the manager of the radio station Soleil D'Haiti in Brooklyn, has been fielding inquiries from concerned callers. In Manhattan, the sidewalk outside the offices of Alianza Dominicana in Washington Heights is all but blocked by folding cots, bags of rice, canned goods and children's toys. A shipping container sits by the curb, its doors open and awaiting donations for the victims of the floods that devastated towns along the Haitian-Dominican border earlier this week. The heavy rains, which swept away buildings, unearthed graves and killed as many as 2,000 people in the remote towns along the border, have brought together two of New York's immigrant groups as they await word on the fate of family and friends and mobilize relief efforts. ''It's really bad, one of the worst I've seen,'' said Mr. Dupuy. ''People want to know how many died.'' Batey Relief Alliance, a group of 15 Haitian and Dominican groups on the island, and Alianza Dominicana are working together to raise money, collect medicine and organize efforts to help the victims. In Flatbush, Brooklyn, Haitians struggled to get information on what was destroyed, who had died and who was homeless. At L'Unique, a Haitian restaurant on Nostrand Avenue, Joseph Halcine said that he had heard about the destruction caused by the flooding, but that he did not realize its extent until he saw it on television. ''I knew it had flooded, but when I saw it on TV it killed me inside,'' Mr. Halcine said. He said that he had not realized that the Haitian border towns of Fond Verrettes and Mapou had been struck hard by the floods. ''I have a couple of friends that live near there. I have to give them a call,'' said Mr. Halcine. He said that even if it turned out he did not know any of the victims of the flood, he would still be concerned. ''I'm still worried because we are all Haitian. We are all brothers and sisters,'' he said. Ulrick Galliard, the executive director of Batey, said that the flood hit his country particularly hard because it came so soon after the departure of the former president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and the violence that followed. ''We had a political hurricane earlier this year. It's been one calamity after another. The country really has suffered a great deal,'' said Henry Frank, the executive director of the Haitian Centers Council, an alliance of Haitian groups throughout the United States. Moises Perez, the executive director of Alianza Dominicana, said that it had started accepting donations on Wednesday and had already filled 200 boxes with donations for the Dominican town of Jimaní. He encouraged people to donate food, money and medicine, particularly multivitamins, eye wash and stomach medicine. His group is hoping to send the supplies on an airline by the beginning of next week. José Collado, 58, an unemployed cook who is a Dominican native, stopped by Alianza's office in Washington Heights yesterday to donate food, clothes and shoes. ''We are Dominican. Everybody is family,'' said Mr. Collado. ''As something happened over there and we help them, something could happen over here and they could help us.''"
"Aid workers, soldiers and villagers struggled to save the living, find the lost and bury the dead in Haiti and the Dominican Republic on Thursday after floods that took everything in their path. ''We have nothing left,'' said Socorro Moquete, a 67-year-old grandmother in Jimaní, the most devastated town in the Dominican Republic. ''The river took everything, even the dead in the cemetery.'' Burials have been rough and rapid, and many hundreds of people remained missing three days after the spring rains made the rivers run wild. An accurate assessment of the death and damage may take days. Government officials in both nations said the confirmed death toll from the devastating floods reached nearly 900 on Thursday. But they said it might go as high as 2,000, with the greatest losses in Haiti, making it one of the worst natural disasters in Caribbean history. The death counts remain estimates from officials citing conflicting and sometimes second-hand information. They stood as high as 1,660 or more in Haiti, according to some government officials, and were confirmed at more than 300 in the Dominican Republic. A total of at least 11,200 families, probably more, have been displaced by the flood in both nations, Red Cross workers here said. Thousands of homes and shanties have been destroyed in villages so poor and isolated that no one is exactly sure how many people lived there before the flood. Two weeks of heavy rains, which continued Thursday, became a deadly torrent at dawn on Monday. In Haiti, as much as five feet fell in 36 hours on the town of Fond Verrettes, in a valley about 40 miles east of the capital, Port-au-Prince, officials said. The rains washed away villages and hamlets clinging to the deforested hills along the border separating the two nations, which share the island of Hispaniola in the Caribbean. The death toll was so high, in part, because almost all the trees on those hills are gone, and the soil is eroded, leaving no natural barrier for the annual spring rains. The trees have been cut for charcoal, the only product with much market value in Haiti, the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation. The two hardest-hit areas in Haiti are in and around Fond Verrettes, where hundreds are dead and missing, and in and around Mapou, to the southeast, where at least 280 people are dead and as many as 1,000 are feared to have died, according to conflicting accounts given by Haitian officials. International aid workers are still trying to reach towns and villages in Haiti's southeast, including Bodarie, Thiotte and Grand Gosier. Margareth Martin, the Haitian government's representative for the southeast region, placed the death toll in the Mapou area at 1,000 and said that rescue efforts were nearly impossible there because the roads were impassable. Prime Minister Gérard Latortue planned to leave Haiti on Thursday for a summit meeting of Latin American and European Union nations in Guadalajara, Mexico, after blaming deforestation for the magnitude of the disaster and promising to create a forest protection unit made up of former soldiers of the demobilized Haitian Army. Just across the border in the Dominican Republic, more than 300 people are dead and 375 still missing in and around the town of Jimaní, where the river burst its banks at dawn Monday, washed away hundreds of homes, killed cattle, destroyed crops and displaced more than 1,000 families, according to Dominican and Red Cross officials. Jimaní residents and local authorities said the death toll might be higher, fearing that many people were buried under the mud or had been washed down to Lago Enriquillo, a lake about 19 miles to the southeast. Jimaní was a town of about 15,000. Now its diminished population is seeking those who were lost, along with food, drinking water and clothing. What was the La Cuarenta neighborhood, its poorest area, is now mud, rocks, branches and debris. Largely inhabited by Haitians, it had been built in a riverbed that had been dry for years. La Cuarenta had several hundred small houses. All have been washed away. Those who lived there are dead or missing. ''The river took my daughter and two granddaughters,'' said Altagracia Recio, 54. ''I lost everything.'' The Dominican Republic's president, Hipólito Mejía, flew to Jimaní on Thursday for the first time since the disaster. So did the United States ambassador, Hans H. Hertell, who said, ''This situation is grim, and we're looking at ways to get more money here.'' Promised aid to the victims includes $50,000 from the United States, $42,000 from Canada, $100,000 from Japan and $2.43 million from the European Union. Family and local private aid has been faster than international relief. Trucks and buses have been traveling to Jimaní since Tuesday with contributions from schools, businesses and individuals. Jimaní was filled with ''Haitians who had fled their country, many trying to make a living in a black market, selling second-hand clothes,'' said Cristina Estrada, a representative of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The Dominican Republic is poor, with a per capita income of about $2,000 a year, but Haiti is far poorer. Its annual per capita income is roughly $400. And the floods in Haiti come at a difficult time, after an uprising that left more than 200 people dead and helped oust President Jean-Bertrand Aristide this winter. A government cobbled together with the help of the United States remains nearly bankrupt, without many functioning agencies. Among those trying to aid the living are members of the American-led multinational military force that occupied Haiti after Mr. Aristide fled three months ago under pressure from rebels and the United States government. Lt. Col. David Lapan, a spokesman for the multinational force, said United States marines had been flying helicopters to Fond Verrettes and Mapou, in the southeastern region of Haiti, for several days, ferrying drinking water, food and plastic sheeting to shelter thousands of people left homeless by the flooding. Mapou, he and others reported, is gone. The town lay in a valley now under as much as 10 feet of water rimmed by mud and rubble. ''In Fond Verrettes, they used what little flat land they had in the middle of this valley, which is what was flooded,'' Colonel Lapan said. ''A flash flood rolled through the area, took what had been a dry streambed and expanded it by a few hundred meters and took everything in its path, and either swept it downstream or buried it right there.'' The forecast called for more rain Friday, which could hamper efforts to deliver relief supplies. Using about half a dozen Marine helicopters, the interim force delivered about 18,000 liters of water and 500 boxes of fruit and bread, but flights may have to halt because of downpours, Colonel Lapan said. The roads between Port-au-Prince and the worst-off towns remained impassable, making helicopters the only way to transport food, water and shelter. Officials at the United Nations World Food Program in Haiti said they were struggling to get enough food for an estimated 15,000 people who had to flee their homes. ''We are trying to react as quickly as possible,'' said Iñigo _lvarez-Miranda, a spokesman for the food program in Port-au-Prince. ''Even before this we were already operating in a country in a deep crisis.'' The program feeds 500,000 of Haiti's 8 million people. The country's man-made misery has grown since the revolt that toppled Mr. Aristide, Mr. _lvarez said, and now this new natural disaster has deepened Haiti's despair."
"The awful truth is that life in this ruined patch of Haiti may be better now than it has ever been, or will ever be again. Doctors and nurses treated the sick and wounded on Sunday in a shack that passed for a clinic. Hulking American helicopters delivered tons of food. People with money and power -- aid workers and American soldiers -- attended to Mapou. For the first time, and perhaps the last, someone strong is looking after the people of Mapou and its outlying hamlets. The people here lost as many as 1,670 of their friends, neighbors and relatives in the floods that have destroyed swaths of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, according to one Red Cross official in Mapou on Sunday, Erich Baumann. The 1,900 American soldiers in Haiti -- and their helicopters, now Mapou's lifeline -- will start leaving the country on Tuesday. They will all be gone in a month. About 1,500 of them are marines based at Camp Lejeune, N.C. More than 1,000 of them were scheduled to go to Iraq in August. Some may take a bit more time to rest, retool and retrain, but almost all will head to Baghdad and beyond by year's end. The Haitian government has about $3 per person to help the estimated 75,000 people affected by the flood. With so little money to aid Mapou's survivors, the government may force them to move. Many of the survivors say they might as well leave forever. ''This land is cursed,'' said Lilie Jean-Baptiste, 26, who like most of her neighbors had willed a living out of the earth, growing a little cassava, buying rice and beans when she scraped a dollar or two together. ''Mapou is over.'' Marcberth St.-Louis, 21, is the son of dirt farmers who dreamed of a better life abroad someday. Mr. St.-Louis, who speaks fluent French, Creole, Spanish and a little English, said: ''For many people here, life is finished. People loved their little piece of land but it's all gone now.'' Raymond Delaba, 15, a survivor of the torrent that took Mapou and now the sole support for his six younger brothers and sisters, said: ''It's just impossible to survive here, with or without the flood. My parents are gone. My house is gone. Our pigs and goats are gone. How am I going to survive? Are we going to eat a handful of rice out of a bag from abroad for the rest of our lives?'' This is what life was like before the flood in Mapou and its six surrounding hamlets -- one of which, Barrois, was completely destroyed: As in most of Haiti's villages, the average income here is a dollar a day or less. Last year, a drought shriveled the corn. For Christmas, fate gave Mapou a flash flood. During and after the February revolt that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected leader, the price of rice -- the staff of life for Haitians -- rose 50 percent in Mapou. That meant 50 percent less to eat, Mapou's survivors said. No leader of Haiti has ever visited Mapou, the people said. ''For the poor, there is no government,'' Ms. Jean-Baptiste said. ''The only government of Haiti is God.'' Now, starting June 1, a coalition of foreign soldiers cobbled together by the United Nations will begin to replace the American-led force that occupied Haiti after the fall of Mr. Aristide, who flew to exile in South Africa on Sunday. It is unclear that this force will have the organization, money or equipment to deal with the emergencies of food, medicine and shelter facing survivors of the flood, who will need help for months to come. The force is supposed to include soldiers from Brazil, China, France, Argentina, Nepal, Bangladesh, Uruguay and the Philippines. But it remains largely a force on paper, though a ceremony beginning the transfer is to take place on Tuesday and the new United Nations force is set to assume command on June 20. The question is what happens to the people of Mapou when the world's fleeting attention -- and the American soldiers -- move on. The same might be asked of the people of nearby Fond Verrettes, where the dead and missing now number close to 200, and Jimaní, just over the border in the Dominican Republic, where more than 700 are dead or missing. No one has counted the dead in two small floodstruck Haitian towns, Nan Galet and Boulou, but unofficially the toll in both nations is now well over 2,000. The United Nations is already running more than a few major operations in places like Liberia, where thousands of peacekeepers patrol a devastated country. The world's aid agencies are struggling to handle a world of crises, many man-made, in places like Afghanistan. The charitable responses of the world's governments to Haiti have been far less than the United Nations sought. So the withdrawal of American forces will not help Haiti cope with its latest disaster. The American military began arriving Feb. 29, the day President Aristide fell, as the capital, Port-au-Prince, was stormed by armed rebels calling for a return of the notorious Haitian Army he had disbanded. The Americans were seen by many Haitians as an occupying force; the United States Marines invaded and essentially ruled Haiti from 1915 to 1934. The return of American forces was welcomed by the armed rebels. But they were hated and feared by armed Aristide loyalists, who saw them as part of the political equation that ended Mr. Aristide's presidency. In the last three months, the American military role in Haiti has shifted from taking -- and returning -- hostile fire, to building a firewall between pro- and anti-Aristide gunmen, to providing a measure of comfort. Troops have delivered 153 tons of food, 30,000 gallons of water, and 13 tons of supplies like tarpaulins and cooking tools to flood victims in the past five days. Before the flood, American, French, Canadian and Chilean soldiers here distributed food and medicine, cleaned up tons of garbage, refurbished schools and repaired orphanages. United States marines are trained to fight a ''three-block war,'' an idea conceived by Gen. Charles Krulak, Marine Corps commandant from 1995 to 1999. ''You're handing out humanitarian assistance to people, you're peacekeepers intervening between forces, you're getting shot in combat,'' is the way Lt. Col. Dave Lapan of the Marines, the spokesman for the American military in Haiti, explains the three-block doctrine. ''Our forces would be able to do all three because, increasingly, that is the world we are going to be living in. ''Haiti has been exactly that,'' Colonel Lapan said. ''When we were first here, we were getting shot at,'' he said. ''We shot back. That calmed things down. Then you get into a neighborhood and help people. That helps protect you. You get information. You get a feeling from the populace that you're not here as an 'occupying force.' Giving people water, rebuilding schools -- that contributes to the mission.'' Haiti, he said, has ''given our marines an experience that will help them later on'' -- in the months to come, when they arrive in Iraq."
"Residents in Gurnee and Des Plaines have spent the last few days struggling with what could be the worst flood in 18 years, placing tens of thousands of sandbags outside their houses, businesses and schools to try to protect them. Some families have already been evacuated from their homes. Others are working around the clock to remove water from their basements as ducks frolic across their lawns in the cities northwest of Chicago. Coming after heavy rains throughout the month, the flood has turned parts of Gurnee into an archipelago, with each house its own island. Bill Morris, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service in Chicago, said the Des Plaines River, the source of the flooding, was expected to crest at about 12 feet in Gurnee, slightly higher than it did during the 1986 flood, which came on quickly and cost $100 million in damage. But the city, which is near the Wisconsin state line, has had several days to prepare and also has much better drainage these days, making officials hopeful that the damage might be less than last time. About 25 miles south of Gurnee, residents in Des Plaines may also experience an unwanted record: the part of the river threatening to overflow onto their roads is expected to crest at just over 11 feet on Thursday. No homes have been damaged there so far. In Gurnee, canoes glided through driveways where cars once stood. Mailboxes peeked above the water in some parts of the city and fire hydrants were nearly submerged. Residents stood on their front porches bewildered, wearing waders or rolling their pants up to the knee as they tried to protect their belongings. The water level at the Grand Animal Hospital, where the front door was protected by sandbags, has already reached the windows. A sign on the door says the hospital is closed, as if anyone would dare visit. Cathy Froman, who was almost giddy with exhaustion on Tuesday afternoon, said she had been working for days to remove her belongings from the basement of her home in Gurnee as she watched water in the backyard climb to nearly four feet. A wall of at least 700 sandbags was protecting her home while several pumps worked day and night to remove water from the basement. ''This is beachfront property,'' Ms. Froman said, laughing as she stood on her back porch, looking at parts of the backyard fence that remained above water. ''We even have sand.'' Ms. Froman, whose belongings spilled out onto the porch, said she was mentally and physically drained, sleeping just a few hours a night. ''There's nothing you can do,'' she said. ''You can't control nature. You're in bed and you're exhausted, but you can't sleep. You're thinking: What if my car floats away? What if the basement floods?'' Unlike the flood in 1986, residents have known about this impending natural disaster for days. At the same time, they have also had more time to imagine the worst. Nancy Hollmaier, 48, who lives a block away from the flooding, has removed all of her family's belongings, including Christmas decorations, photographs, clothing and furniture, from the bottom floor of her house. On Friday, the water had creeped up toward her garage. ''The hardest part is not knowing when it's going to peak,'' she said, sitting down to lunch after working to help protect other houses. Representative Philip M. Crane, who toured the area in a canoe on Tuesday afternoon, referred to the city as a disaster area and said he would consider asking for assistance from the federal government. ''It's got to be devastating for these families,'' Mr. Crane said, as he glided down one of the city's main streets and stared at a truck that was half-submerged. ''It's horrifying.'' Linda Hardin, a school custodian for eight years, has been working night and day to protect Gurnee Grade School on Kilbourne Road, a large, recently renovated building surrounded by four feet of sandbags and at least two feet of water. ''We've got five wet vacs and there are squeegees everywhere,'' said Ms. Hardin, who slept for only five hours the night before. ''It's our livelihood.'' -------------------- Storms Kill Woman in Illinois INDEPENDENCE, Iowa, May 25 (AP) -- Severe storms swept through central Illinois early Tuesday, killing a woman and damaging houses and businesses in at least three towns near Springfield, the authorities said. Ada Ruth White, 63, was found dead shortly after midnight Tuesday after the storm destroyed her mobile home in rural Winchester, about 40 miles west of Springfield, according to the Scott County coroner's office. The storms followed more severe weather on Monday, when tornadoes touched down in Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma . The storms that moved across Iowa on Friday, Saturday and Sunday brought as much as nine inches of rain to areas near Ames. The downpours on Monday night brought more than three inches to some areas. No more rain is forecast in Iowa until Friday evening and possibly the weekend, said Brad Fillbach, a National Weather Service technician. ''At least we'll have a few good days of drying and give the rivers a chance to start dropping,'' Mr. Fillbach said. Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa asked for a federal disaster declaration for 24 counties, including Humboldt County, where nearly every building in the small town of Bradgate was damaged by a tornado on Friday. Four tornadoes were reported Monday evening in or near Chillicothe, Mo. Two girls were injured in a mobile home that was picked up by a tornado and dropped onto a car."
"Mapou is gone. So are a thousand people who lived here. This was a town with outlying hamlets where perhaps 10,000 lived, or endured. They scratched a living from the earth, down in a steep green valley in the southeast corner of Haiti, in the deepest poverty of the Western world. On Monday, ''the rain started falling so hard, it was like the flood in the Bible,'' said Fernando Gueren, a farmer who lost his parents and his son in the deluge. The river that runs through Mapou drowned the town on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Lt. Col. Duane Perry of the United States Marines flew down the valley in a helicopter after delivering aid to another devastated town, Fond Verrettes. He looked down at a muddy lake with a few roofs poking through its shallows and said, ''It looks like there was a town there.'' That lake was Mapou. The town was under 25 feet of water, Colonel Perry said. The dead hung from the trees. Standing amid tons of rice he helped carry to Mapou on Friday, he said the village elders had told him that at least 300 people were dead and that 700 more had vanished and were feared to have drowned. ''We estimate about 1,000 dead'' in Mapou, Colonel Perry said. If so, Mapou is the most devastated place among the many damaged and destroyed in the floods that killed perhaps 2,000 people in Haiti and on its border with the Dominican Republic this week. That toll remains an estimate, and may remain a rough guess for days. What is only now becoming clear is that ''the magnitude of the disaster is much worse than we expected, with many, many more people affected,'' said Guy Gauvreau, director of the United Nations World Food Program in Haiti, who brought the rice, water and cooking oil that reached Mapou on Friday on an American helicopter. ''There are many other places around here, many towns, we know nothing about,'' he said in Mapou. These towns and hamlets, home to thousands of Haitians, remain cut off from the world by mudslides. It may take days more to reach them and tally their losses. In Mapou, hundreds of survivors waited patiently to pick up a sack of rice, a jug of cooking oil, a bottle of water, their faces masked in sorrow, hunger and dread. They said that almost everything they owned, and many whom they loved, were gone. Most of the dead and missing were children. ''My family's all dead,'' said Pedro Nisson, 28, a traditional healer. ''When the rains came, the people tried to flee to the hills, but the water drove them back.'' Féry Destinée, 25, was a little more fortunate. ''I have nothing,'' she said. ''My family's alive, thank God, but my house and my fields are gone.'' The waters that swallowed the town had receded by Friday but still stood 10 feet deep. The crops, chiefly corn, are destroyed. Goats and pigs have drowned. The wells are poisoned with bodies. Epidemics are likely, aid workers here said. The torrent washed out all the roads that connected every village in its path to the capital, Port-au-Prince, where aid agencies warehouse their food. There is no chance that the roads can be repaired for weeks, maybe months, said Mr. Gauvreau, as he surveyed the wreckage of Mapou. The gap between the aid that is being delivered now and the aid that is needed is enormous, he said. ''Here in Mapou, we planned aid for 1,000 families, but 3,000 families are affected,'' he said, figuring on five people to a family. In all, some 75,000 people in and around Mapou and Fond Verrettes, two of the hardest-hit Haitian towns, face ''a continuing food emergency'' for months to come, he said. Fourteen helicopters of the American-led international military force that occupied Haiti after President Jean-Bertrand Aristide fled under United States pressure on Feb. 29 are now the lifeline for those tens of thousands of hungry, homeless villagers. Almost all those helicopters belong to the United States military, which President Bush has said will leave Haiti in June after a mission intended to restore a measure of stability to the country. ''We rely on the military for airlift,'' Mr. Gauvreau said. Come summer, aid agencies may have to resort to barges, rafts and mules to carry food, medicine and shelter to a displaced population whose numbers may reach 100,000 or more. ''We can't survive like this much longer,'' said Charles Josié, 48, in Mapou. A helicopter flight on Friday to Mapou from the devastated Dominican border town of Jimaní, roughly following the path of the flood, showed how this disaster was both natural and man-made. While roughly five feet of rain fell Sunday and Monday, the water ran down land denuded of trees, over thin soil eroded by decades of slash-and-burn farming. The rain filled rivulets and rivers, running so hard down the steep and treeless slopes, until the raging muddy waters reached the valley that sheltered Mapou and engulfed it. ''Most people here work the earth, but the most desperate take the trees'' to make charcoal, which sells for a few pennies a pound at market, said Mr. Gueren, the farmer in Mapou. ''When they take the trees, there's nothing left to drink up the water. ''They wreck the land to survive,'' he said. ''This is one of the problems of Haiti too great to solve with a sack of rice.'' Many of the more than 300 confirmed dead in Jimaní were Haitians fleeing poverty. Jimaní's shacks were eradicated by a 100-yard-wide torrent, now a blank dry slash through the town. Little relief appeared to have reached Jimaní as of Friday morning. Most of the town has fled. Many of the dead lie in a common grave, and the missing are believed to have drowned in a nearby lake filled with crocodiles. The government plans to spray the town with disinfectant from airplanes to slow or stop the spread of disease from the destruction. There may be worse to come in Haiti, as the spring rains continue, and soldiers and aid workers struggle to reach still-lost villages with their small fleet of helicopters, and by running rivers on rubber dinghies. After slavery under the French, two centuries of rulers who misruled and a shaky provisional government with almost nothing in its treasury, this disaster may not be the worst misfortune Haitians have ever suffered, but for now the suffering seems endless in Mapou. ''It's impossible to see how we will make it through the days to come,'' said Mr. Nisson, Mapou's healer."
"The government of Bangladesh, at first reluctant to accept outside aid, has asked for international help to cope with the aftermath of the monumental flooding that has left more than 400 dead and millions homeless, marooned, or at risk of water-borne diseases. Floods are a recurring problem in Bangladesh, which is in a delta crossed by three major rivers and many tributaries. But the waters have been particularly severe for the last three weeks, particularly in Dhaka, the capital, and its vicinity, with other countries, including India, China, Nepal and Vietnam also deluged. More rain was forecast, even as many rivers receded Thursday. Millions of Bangladesh slum dwellers, who live in flimsy housing on insubstantial land, have watched as their homes were submerged, and then moved to roadsides or road embankments in Dhaka and the highway outside it. The distribution of food has been a great challenge. Local journalists in Bangladesh have reported that not all promised aid has reached the hungry, and that some of it has been stale or rotten. Shahnoor Wahid, a journalist who is a consultant for the World Health Organization, said he expected to see malnutrition worsen. But perhaps even more critical is the lack of clean water. As the deluges continued, tube wells and boreholes supplying clean drinking water were submerged and sewage systems broke down, sending fetid refuse into spreading floodwaters. Douglas Coutts, the country representative for the World Food Program said he had watched displaced slum dwellers scoop up floodwater to drink because they had nothing else, and wash clothes in it. After days of torrents, waters were also retreating in the Indian states of Assam and Bihar. In Bihar, where the floodwaters have largely receded, 489 people had died as of Thursday, with half a million houses damaged and, by the state's estimate, $60 million in crops lost. In Assam, the flooding had left 199 dead as of Thursday and sent 1.3 million people to refugee camps. More than 2.8 million acres of farmland and 522,820 houses were damaged. Tarun Gogoi, the chief minister of Assam, said by telephone Thursday night that while the situation was improving, some of the displaced people would have to remain in camps while their homes were rebuilt. He and aid officials in Bangladesh worried that the greatest impact on health was still to come. As the waters recede, officials are bracing for a possible epidemic of diarrhea. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Khaleda Zia of Bangladesh authorized the United Nations to issue an appeal for help on behalf of Bangladesh. The money would be used for rehabilitation and reconstruction. For days, as the flood waters rose, the government resisted seeking foreign help. Mr. Coutts said he had seen similar reactions in many developing countries where natural disasters are common. ''Governments are very eager to show they can handle it themselves,'' he said. Bangladesh is the world's most densely populated country, with 147 million people crammed into an area the size of Iowa. ''It has far too many people in all the wrong places,'' Mr. Coutts said, referring to the sandbars and flood plains where the poor live. Mr. Wahid said by phone from Dhaka that families often had to wade through the waters to secure relief, and more than 27,000 cases of diarrhea have been reported in flooded areas of Bangladesh since July 13. The country's Rotary Clubs were going to undertake a vast effort to distribute clean drinking water. But Mr. Wahid said that he expected to see many more cases of diarrhea."
"Heavy rains lashed the New York area last night, snarling traffic, stranding drivers, and possibly causing part of an overpass to collapse onto Grand Central Parkway in Queens, hitting a van and seriously injuring its driver, the authorities said. A 60-foot-long sheet of concrete fell from the bottom of Steinway Street onto the parkway, where it was immediately struck by the westbound van just after 9 p.m., said Mike Tavarese, a supervisor at the Department of Transportation who was at the scene. The driver, who was not immediately identified by the police, was taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center with two broken legs, the authorities said. Mr. Tavarese said a company had begun repairs to the pedestrian walkway on the overpass early this week. He also said the heavy rain might have been a factor in the collapse. Rain-drenched rescue workers closed streets in the area, further clogging already-snarled traffic and bringing cars on the Queens portion of the Triborough Bridge to a standstill. The parkway was expected to reopen sometime today, said Tom Cocola, a spokesman for the Transportation Department. Mr. Cocola identified the construction company as Caltran, and said it had begun work on the overpass in preparation for its removal, scheduled for next week. Authorities said the company had been slicing off three-foot sections of concrete from the overpass. The rain came so intensely that streets in New York and New Jersey quickly filled with water, forcing drivers to detour or find their way through several feet of water. In Queens, motorists traveled single file down the center of 21st Avenue to avoid lakelike puddles along its edges. Some drivers had pulled over. Cars swerved to avoid flooded areas, causing some accidents. Throngs of pedestrians held umbrellas and looked for cabs on street corners in the East Village. Drivers coming from New Jersey met lengthy delays at the Holland Tunnel. The National Weather Service said 2.32 inches of rain had fallen in Central Park as of midnight, less than a tenth of an inch shy of the historical daily record of 2.41 inches that was set in 1953, according to Michael Silva, a meteorologist with the service in Upton, on Long Island. The historical average for the day is 0.15 inches, he said. The service also issued flash flood warnings last night for Hunterdon, Morris, Somerset, Mercer and Bergen Counties in New Jersey, where as many as six inches of rain had fallen, said Joe Miketta, a meteorologist for the service in Mount Holly. The collapse in Queens just missed a large bus, which was traveling behind the van but stopped before hitting it, said Chief Edward Kilduff of the Fire Department. ''They were about four seconds behind the van,'' he said. The slab appeared to have broken in two and fallen in the shape of a V. The heavy rains came just days after major flooding in South Jersey. Forecasters said showers were likely in the New York area for the weekend and next week. New Jersey was hit the hardest yesterday. The authorities in Lodi, in Bergen County, rescued people from about 10 cars stranded in flooded areas yesterday, said Robert Cassiello, the town's emergency management coordinator. The Saddle River, which flows through the city, was swollen, he said. ''The river is at the top of its banks now,'' he added. In Hackensack, flooding from the Hackensack River stranded several cars. Nick Marino, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., stood with an umbrella next to his Lexus sport utility vehicle, which had stalled when he tried to maneuver through three feet of water on Mercer and River Streets. By 6 p.m., several hours after Mr. Marino's car stalled, rain was still falling, and his call for a tow truck had gone unanswered. ''There were dozens of people stranded today,'' said Bill Kovatch, the owner of Circle Auto Repair, also in Hackensack. WABC-TV, Channel 7, reported on an evening newscast that one of its reporter had been in a car accident while reporting in Hackensack, and had been taken to the hospital with injuries. Traffic delays were also reported along roads in Westchester County. The Bronx River Parkway in White Plains was closed briefly because of the rain and Route 9A in Ossining was under water for about an hour, but was passable by 7 p.m., the police said."
"Residents in flood-stricken areas of South Jersey cheered President Bush's approval of federal disaster aid yesterday as they continued to clean up their waterlogged towns while nervously listening to weekend forecasts predicting more heavy rain. About 750 families were evacuated when more than 13 inches of rain fell during last week's deluge, which caused at least 14 dams in Burlington County to break, sending fast-moving water into streets, businesses and homes in the central part of the county. On Friday, President Bush gave the Federal Emergency Management Agency approval to allocate about $20 million to Burlington and Camden Counties, according to the White House. Affected residents will be required to fill out claim forms before receiving grants for temporary housing, home repairs and low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses. Gov. James E. McGreevey, who declared a state of emergency in the counties, pledged $5 million in state aid to help residents rebuild. He also allocated another $30 million to a $95 million state bond issue for restoration work to dams statewide. The director of the Burlington County Board of Freeholders, Vincent R. Farias, said yesterday that 200 people in Lumberton and 25 in Vincentown would not be permitted to spend the night in their homes because of safety concerns and power failures, but would be permitted to begin cleaning and removing debris during daylight hours. The National Weather Service issued a new flood warning to the affected areas yesterday after forecasting severe thunderstorms that could dump one to three inches of rain this afternoon and evening, causing additional flooding. On Friday, state transportation workers lowered a temporary steel truss bridge over Friendship Creek on Route 70, a main east-west thoroughfare that connects Philadelphia to the Jersey Shore, said a New Jersey Department of Transportation spokesman, Joe Fiordaliso. A 34-foot section of the bridge washed away during the storm, and Mr. Fiordaliso said the temporary bridge was expected to open on Tuesday. As residents continued the cleanup, Mr. Farias urged people working in the area to exercise caution while cleaning and walking through affected areas. He said that a woman in Lumberton received second-degree burns on her foot as she walked through a puddle in her backyard that had filled with a caustic substance. ''Nothing is really safe in this area,'' Mr. Farias said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''Everyone needs to be aware of the hazards that come with the flood's aftermath.'' He said workers were also spraying larvicide into standing water throughout the county to prevent mosquitoes, which have the potential to carry the West Nile virus, from migrating. ''There is still a lot of work to do down here,'' Mr. Farias said. ''A lot of pain and additional costs have yet to been recognized. Part of our lives washed away.''"
"On Tabernacle Trail here, residents returned to their homes Wednesday for the first time since a day of driving rain led to the worst flooding in Burlington County in 100 years. They found that a small stream in Jackson Park, usually no more than 3 feet wide, had swelled to more than 70 feet at points after dams on Upper and Lower Aetna Lakes gave way on Monday night. The force of the water was so strong that it caused a metal canoe to bend around a tree and touch end to end. A wooded area across from the park was littered with cars, rowboats, furniture -- even a totem pole and reading glasses. ''It just makes you want to cry,'' said John Lang, who lives on Tabernacle Trail. ''It is amazing that with all this devastation no one was killed.'' More than 750 families were evacuated when more than 13 inches of rain fell during Monday's storm, causing at least 12 dams in the county to break and send fast-moving water into streets, businesses and homes in the central part of the county. On Wednesday, residents around the county spent the day cleaning mounds of silt from living rooms and garages while taking inventory of furnishings and mementos lost. A state of emergency declared by Gov. James E. McGreevey on Monday was to remain in effect while officials waited to see if additional rain, expected overnight, caused more problems. On Wednesday, as floodwaters continued to recede, Mr. McGreevey announced that $5 million in state aid would be allocated to the affected towns to supplement any federal disaster funds. Because of the severity of the damage, he said, it would be a few more days before federal disaster inspectors could estimate its cost. ''The people need to rebuild,'' Mr. McGreevey said. ''They need federal money to begin their lives again.'' Mr. McGreevey also announced that $30 million would be added to a $95 million state bond issue for restoration work on state dams. He said workers were watching two dams that were in ''significant jeopardy'' if faced with more pressure. In Lumberton, N.J., about 200 people were evacuated on Wednesday morning after officials said active power lines in the water posed a serious threat to people wading through waist-deep floods to survey their homes. Utility workers spent the day cutting power only to affected homes, said Vincent R. Farias, director of the Burlington County Board of Freeholders, adding that only about 50 homes were without power. ''In some cases, workers cannot get to certain areas because of still dangerous floodwaters, so the power remains on in places that it should not be, so the public will not be allowed in those areas until they are safe,'' he said. Around 9 p.m. yesterday, Burlington County officials began mandatory evacuations in New Lisbon, N.J., for about 100 people near the Presidential Lakes dam. Workers planned to release some of the water held by the dam in to ensure that it would not wash away under pressure from overnight rainfall. The release was expected to raise water levels in the area around Pemberton, N.J., by a few feet, making evacuations necessary. Lifeguards from a Medford Lakes day camp, Camp Ockanickon, spent the morning searching for the camp's missing canoes. The canoes washed away after several dams gave way in the deluge. Across the road, on Lenape Trail, Tony DiCiano's computer and the rest of his home office lay on the side of the road along with a refrigerator and mounds of soaking wet carpet. The floodwaters rose more than four feet in the first level of his house, destroying furniture, antique toys, comic books and baseball cards, and ruining renovation work he had just completed. Workers from the State Department of Transportation continued work to install a temporary bridge on Route 70, a main thoroughfare connecting Philadelphia to the Jersey Shore, after the 34-foot span in Southampton Township was destroyed early on Tuesday. Transportation Commissioner Jack Lettiere said that the bridge would be installed within a week and that a permanent replacement could cost as much as $3 million. As residents cleaned up, they kept watch on the gray skies after the National Weather Service issued a flood warning throughout the affected area on Wednesday evening and said that up to two inches of rain could fall on the already saturated ground. ''We don't want any more rain, we just want to clean up and begin again,'' said Rich Miller, 49, a truck driver from Vincentown, N.J., as he walked through his house, built in 1864. ''We're not moving,'' said Mr. Miller. ''This is our home, we, like many others, will rebuild. Besides, I don't think anyone would want to buy the place with all the water in the backyard.''"
"This time, it was Bergen County. While drivers in other parts of supersaturated New Jersey enjoyed a reprieve of sorts on Friday evening as they traveled rain-slicked but flood-free roads, dozens of people found themselves trapped in cars in Bergen County when they tried to navigate streets where water had pooled. ''Local people are used to it,'' said Lt. Ed Reuter of the Police Department in Lodi, which straddles the Saddle River just south of Interstate 80. ''They know when it rains, stay out of Lodi,'' said Lieutenant Reuter, whose department received about 20 stranded motorist calls. In Burlington County, where on July 13 a 13-inch rainfall caused severe flooding, Ricki Lucas, the dispatch supervisor in the county's Office of Emergency Management, reported that further flooding had not occurred. ''I heard they had problems up north,'' she said. ''We lucked out.'' Deputy Chief Edward Koeser of the Hackensack Police Department said he heard reports that on Friday rain flooded basements and trapped cars in his Bergen County city, but by yesterday things had returned to normal. A reporter from Channel 7, Sade Baderinwa, was injured when she was struck by a car on Friday while covering the flooding in Hackensack. She was taken to Hackensack University Medical Center, where she was in stable condition yesterday, according to the channel's Web site."
"A freakish midsummer deluge that pounded parts of southern New Jersey forced more than 750 people to flee their flooded homes yesterday and left a landscape of burst dams, damaged bridges and debris-filled roads throughout Burlington County. No deaths or serious injuries were reported after the storm, which drenched the area in 13 inches of rain Monday night and early yesterday, but meteorologists were awed. Roy Miller, with the National Weather Service, described the rainfall as ''kind of astronomical'' for a 24-hour period. Charlie Donnelly, 57, a telephone line repairmen, said he awoke about 4 a.m. yesterday after rushing water broke the basement windows in his two-story brick home on Creek Road in Lumberton Township. He and his two sons, Charles Jr., 32, and Michael, 26, finally left the house about 8 a.m. for dry land. ''We've lived here for more than 30 years,'' Mr. Donnelly said. ''We've had water before, water in the basement. But nothing's ever been this bad.'' In midafternoon, Mr. Donnelly's sons paddled a canoe, a favorite mode of evacuation and travel yesterday, in hopes of collecting some dry shoes and shirts. They returned with word that everything on the first floor had been destroyed. Twelve dams were destroyed in the deluge and two others were damaged, and water escaping from small lakes behind the dams compounded the flooding, especially in neighborhoods and small commercial districts in Medford Township and neighboring Medford Lakes, county and state officials said. Farther north, the Rancocas Creek and several of its tributaries poured over their banks, flooding parts of Lumberton, Vincentown, Hampton Lakes, Tabernacle Township and other communities along a 15-mile stretch of farmland and emerging suburbia about 25 miles southeast of Philadelphia. The flooding also destroyed or damaged three bridges, including a 34-foot span on Route 70, a main east-west highway that links the stricken area to Camden and Philadelphia to the west and the Jersey Shore to the east. The damage to the dams underscored the vulnerability of hundreds of small earthen dams in New Jersey during intense rainstorms. During Tropical Storm Floyd in September 1999, 3 small dams were destroyed and 21 others were damaged in parts of Somerset, Hunterdon, Morris and Passaic Counties. In August 2000, during a three-day storm, up to 14 inches of rain fell on parts of Sussex and Morris Counties, destroying 4 dams and damaging 26, leading to flooding. Last November, New Jersey voters approved a $95 million bond issue for restoration work on nearly 360 dams that state inspectors had determined needed repairs. Many are privately owned and were built years ago to create small, privately owned lakes. Seven of the 12 dams that washed away Monday night and yesterday morning were on the repair list. State environmental officials said they had not yet determined if any of the owners had applied for repair money from the bonds. Many of the homes in the area use private wells and septic systems, and county officials appealed to those with damaged septic systems to minimize the flushing of toilets until repairs were made. The National Weather Service in Mount Holly said rainfall ranged from 13.2 inches in Tabernacle and 11.2 inches in New Lisbon to 4.21 inches in Mount Holly. ''It's almost ridiculous to get that much rainfall in a 24-hour period,'' said Mr. Miller, the National Weather Service meteorologist. ''I wouldn't expect to see this again.'' He attributed the deluge to a warm front that came up from the South Monday and stalled over Burlington County and then was joined by a low pressure system from the southwest. He likened the rainfall, especially around Tabernacle, to a severe hurricane or tropical storm that lingers in an area. The mayor of Medford Township, Chris Myers, said several streets were under eight to nine feet of water during the night. ''It was just phenomenal,'' he said of the swift rise of the floodwaters. Lenape High School in Medford Township was one of several schools in the region turned into emergency shelters for evacuees. Eighty people stayed at the school on Monday night, the Red Cross said. Officials said yesterday afternoon that they were expecting 200 to 300 people to have dinner in the school's cafeteria last night and then spend the night on cots in the gymnasium. In late afternoon, Joe Filer, 33, a chef, began pumping out the basement of his home near Main Street in Medford Township. He spoke of a bit of good fortune that spared his family and scores of other residents as they tried to flee Monday night. Emergency workers issued evacuation orders about 11 p.m., he said. But the bridge on their escape route was flooded, and cars were backed up on both sides of it. He said he and his wife, Jennifer, and their two sons, 5 and 2 years old, sat in the car for about four hours, stuck in traffic. But during that time, the floodwaters crested and began receding, and the traffic began moving about 3 a.m., he said. In Southampton, near Vincentown, someone apparently rescued five horses from pastureland or a barn threatened by floodwaters and took them to the safety of a dry and fenced tennis court in the center of town and left. In midafternoon, officials of the Federal Emergency Management Agency toured the stricken areas with state and local officials to begin determining if the flooded towns would be declared a federal disaster area and eligible for grants and low-interest loans. During a news conference, Mike Beeman, chief of external affairs for the agency, talked of the force of the floodwaters. In several areas, Mr. Beeman said, he saw canoes wrapped, end to end, around the trunks of trees."
"ONLY one government holds true power over life and death in Haiti today. Not the Haitian government, a group of penniless, powerless, provisional appointees; nor the United States government, whose military forces are pulling out after a three-month occupation, having landed hours after the fall of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's first and only freely elected leader. The true government of Haiti is a confederation of sweaty men and women in T-shirts, from South Dakota, Stockholm and a hundred other places: the stateless nation of aid workers, flying many flags but pledging allegiance only to the poor. By an off-the-cuff but conservative guess, aid workers help keep a million of Haiti's eight million people alive -- and that was before the flood that struck this island and swept so many lives away. Government by nongovernmental organizations has gone on in many failed or faltering states, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. (Such groups often face danger: Doctors Without Borders suspended operations in Afghanistan on Thursday after five of its workers were ambushed and killed.) Though the United States government donates money and food, and the United Nations, a pale shadow of a world government, plays a crucial role through its many agencies, big bureaucracies have a hard time helping little villages, imposing top-down strategies on places needing help from the ground up. Washington's will changes with the political winds; the United Nations' wallet is thin. So Haiti is in the hands of aid agencies and church groups working to ease the pain of flood, famine and political folly. The United Nations troops that are set to replace the American military as a security force have barely arrived. The troops have no transport helicopters and little money, and providing aid is not their priority. Haiti's provisional government has proved incapable of helping its people. The flood, by this weekend, had left 2,600 people dead (or presumed dead) in Haiti, and at least 700 more (many of them Haitians) across the border in the Dominican Republic. The town of Mapou was hit the hardest. The flood took the lives of 1,600 people and left perhaps 10 times that number bereft in Mapou and the isolated hamlets surrounding it, though the true toll may never be known. Last week in Mapou, Prosper Baptiste, 39, who lived in the small village of Bois Tombé -- Fallen Forest -- said he lost 33 members of his extended family. Mapou is named after a sacred tree in voodoo tradition. But almost all the trees of Haiti are gone, cut for charcoal sold for a few pennies a pound. So the hard rain swept down from the hills and the rivers burst their banks, taking everything in their path. Last Sunday, five days after the rain let up, the aid agencies saw that the disaster was far worse than feared -- roughly three or four times as bad, with 75,000 to 100,000 people needing long-lasting help. On Monday, the United States military stopped using its heavy Chinook helicopters, the only such craft in Haiti, to ferry tons of United Nations food to the flood victims. A military spokesman here said that the crews and choppers needed rest, and that the immediate needs of the victims had been met. The American soldiers had orders to begin withdrawing from Haiti starting Tuesday, preparing to turn over the country to United Nations-led peacekeepers on June 20. The aid agencies, furious at the American pullback, started seeking bulldozers to fix the washed-out roads to the cut-off villages and their own helicopters. The cost, they learned, would be staggering. The only way to Mapou was on foot. At 4 a.m. on Monday, Tammie Willcuts, 33, a native of Sioux Falls, S.D., who works for Save the Children and has labored in Afghanistan, Iraq and Sudan, awoke in a mud hut on Haiti's southeast coast and laced up her hiking boots. With her were colleagues from Catholic Relief Services, bringing food, cooking pots, cups and spoons, and workers from World Vision, carrying clothes and blankets. They had arrived at the fishing village of Anse-_-Boeuf on Sunday afternoon on a rickety wooden boat, after hearing that a footpath led from there to Mapou. No outsider had visited at least a dozen flood-stricken villages along the way, where tens of thousands of people had received no aid in the week since the flood. Ms. Willcuts and her colleagues would be the first to reach some of these places, where deaths remain uncounted but are reported by villagers to be in the hundreds. How word travels in Haiti is a mystery. When Ms. Willcuts awoke on Monday she saw ''a corral of mules that the people of Mapou had taken down to the coast,'' she said in an interview. ''They were there because they knew there was aid coming. Somehow word had spread to Mapou that these goods would land.'' So the villagers had saddled up their mules and walked to the sea. Ms. Willcuts set out north on the trail, nearly five hours of walking, ''hotter than blazes, and no source of fresh water along the way,'' she recalled. ''There were mules coming down the trail from Mapou,'' she said. ''Every fourth family had a mule with them. And there was this parking lot of mules at Anse-_-Boeuf. They loaded up the mules as best they could and started back home.'' On the path to Mapou, the aid workers learned that the deliveries wouldn't begin to meet the need. ''First, there's Cibao, which has about 2,500 families, maybe 12,500 people,'' Ms. Willcuts said. ''They had received no assistance. There were still areas totally covered with water. They said they didn't know how many people were dead. They'd received no aid, nothing. ''I got the names of nine other villages, where maybe 15,000 people lived, that had received no aid. These are extremely poor people who were barely hanging on before the flood.'' With most roads still in ruins, and tons of food, water and medicine warehoused in the capital, word got out about the Mapou mule train. Haiti's mules would have to do when Chinooks no longer flew. Kieron Crawley of Concern Worldwide, a charity based in Dublin, said he planned to carry supplies by truck to the town of Thiotte on Friday and use mules to reach ''little towns that lie in a trail of destruction from Mapou down to the coast.'' Yolette Etienne, Oxfam's coordinator in Haiti, said: ''We can use mules to reach the most affected people in the countryside. We will truck water to Fond Verrettes,'' the second-hardest-hit town in Haiti, ''and use the mules to take it to the little villages.'' ''The mules will come from the people,'' she said. In 1821, Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote that ''poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.'' In Haiti today, aid workers are the unacknowledged leaders of the nation.

"A 20-inch water main broke yesterday in Canarsie, Brooklyn, spilling water into the intersection of Avenue L and East 108th Street for more than two hours, a Fire Department spokesman said. The underground main broke about 4:30 p.m., the spokesman, Firefighter Paul Iannizzotto, said. Authorities from a number of city agencies worked to cut off the flow of water, which flooded basements in six houses, Firefighter Iannizzotto said. Gas, electricity and water were shut off to nearby houses. The authorities were able to shut off the water flow about 7 p.m., Firefighter Iannizzotto said. Investigators had not determined the reason for the break last night, he said, but it did not appear to have been caused by street repair work."
"The number of dead or missing totaled nearly 1,000 on Friday from the flash floods and landslides that have devastated a large section of the northern Philippines, rescue officials said. The disaster began with a storm that slammed into the northeastern Philippines early this week. A second storm swept the country on Thursday, hampering search and rescue efforts from the first. The military confirmed that 492 people had died as of Thursday night, most of them from three coastal towns in Quezon Province in the east, while about 400 others were missing, Agence France-Presse reported. Thursday's storm, packing winds of 130 miles an hour, was the fourth to hit the Philippines in two weeks. In Manila, the capital, the storm brought heavy rains that inundated flood-prone areas. Alert levels were raised and evacuation centers were established in most of the provinces of the main island of Luzon. The Coast Guard restricted shipping and airlines canceled flights. The storm delayed for 10 hours a ship carrying 600 passengers, causing panic among relatives, some of whom spread the rumor that the ship might have sunk. Hundreds of seafarers were stuck in ports in the north as the storm worsened. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who visited one devastated town on Thursday, lent her four helicopters to the rescue efforts after winds grounded military aircraft. In Real, east of Manila, volunteers used their hands to dig out buried houses and extricate the dead. President Arroyo's press secretary, Ignacio Bunye, said the government had adequate contingency measures. He appealed to the public to help displaced people. ''This is a time for every capable Filipino to chip in to serve the less fortunate,'' he said. Some countries and nongovernment groups have started aiding storm victims. The United States government is donating $100,000 to the Philippine National Red Cross, the government announced. Some European countries, notably Germany, have pledged support. Mrs. Arroyo blamed illegal logging for the severity of the landslides and flash floods that have resulted from the storms. She ordered a crackdown on illegal loggers, assigning a former intelligence chief of the military to lead the effort. Environmentalists said all logging, legal or not, had contributed to the denuding of the country's forest, of which only 13 percent remains. About 20 typhoons and other storms occur every year in the Philippines. In 1991, a storm caused huge landslides in Ormoc in the central Philippines, burying communities and killing more than 7,000 people. Since then, environmentalists have warned the government that similar disasters could occur if logging continued. Government efforts to regulate logging have been ineffective. Illegal logging has continued, often with the complicity of corrupt environment officials and law enforcers."
"Mohammed Zaini, a limousine driver in Queens, says he knows every family in New York City that hails from his home province of Aceh in Indonesia. There are only about 10 of them. But together, Mr. Zaini said, they are mourning -- or preparing to mourn -- for hundreds and hundreds of relatives. Yesterday it was becoming apparent that the devastation from the tsunamis that struck on Sunday has been more complete in Aceh (pronounced AH-chay), a place of shimmering beaches and dense forests at the northwest tip of the island of Sumatra, than anywhere else. Death toll estimates are well into the tens of thousands, and entire towns along the coast have not been heard from. In a place where towns and villages are made up of networks of extended families, reckoning the loss of kin was more than the mind could bear. ''Between my wife and me,'' Mr. Zaini said yesterday at his house in Astoria, ''our family is more than 300 people.'' Most of them, he said, have not been heard from. His wife, Yusra Zaini, showed a family picture and pointed to three women, one at a time. Gone, gone, missing. ''Cousins, aunts, sister, best friend, close friend,'' said Ms. Zaini, 40, who is studying to be a Montessori teacher. ''We can't contact anyone.'' She held up another photograph she took on vacation over the summer. A dozen members of her family stood before a gleaming white mosque in Banda Aceh, the provincial capital. One was her sister, resplendently pregnant. ''She gave birth on Friday at the hospital,'' Ms. Zaini said. ''Sunday morning when the waves hit, she was still in the hospital. The hospital is supposedly gone.'' A knock came at the Zainis' door. It was Donny Teuku, a friend from Meulaboh, a town that can be found on maps by tracing where the shock waves from the undersea earthquake first struck land. ''The worst is your town,'' Mr. Zaini told Mr. Teuku by way of greeting. ''It's the worst one,'' Mr. Teuku agreed. ''No one has news,'' Mr. Zaini said. He was exaggerating. There has been a little news. On Sunday the mayor of Meulaboh was heard on a radio broadcast in Indonesia estimating that 75 percent of his city had been washed away. The vice president of Indonesia, Jusuf Kalla, confirmed as much on Monday after a flyover of the western coast. He said perhaps 10,000 people had died in Meulaboh, out of a population of 35,000. Back in New York, Abdul Zainuddin, on the other hand, was somewhat buoyed after talking to relatives near Sigli, in northeastern Aceh. ''I got already good news there,'' said Mr. Zainuddin, an administrator at the Indonesian Consulate. ''My family is safe. Two sisters and two nephews. Found alive in a shelter in Sigli.'' Only a few minutes later, he mentioned the bad news. A niece was found dead, and her three children are missing. Mr. Zainuddin, 54, was at home in Sunnyside, Queens, yesterday, making plans to fly to Indonesia before the end of the week. He looked as if he had not slept for days. ''First I have to go to the hometown,'' he said, and look for family members. ''If they're not there, I will ask someone where is the shelter.'' He will take with him as much clothing as he can carry and as much medicine as he can get his hands on. ''I am going to the doctor to get some pills for the trip, for malaria and cholera,'' he said. ''Maybe when I explain my situation, he could prescribe double or triple so I can bring more.'' He knows he cannot do much. ''Sometimes I feel, 'What for to go home?''' he said. ''But I need to go. At least to make them -- not happy -- I hope just to make some spirit for them.'' Mr. Zaini, the limousine driver, said he wanted to go home but could not. Aceh, also home to a long, bloody secessionist conflict, has been under martial law since last year. Mr. Zaini said that a very good friend, a human rights activist, was executed by the government and that he was afraid he would be killed if he went back. On Monday, Indonesia's military chief called for a temporary cease-fire with the rebels so that emergency aid could get through. Mr. Zaini was not much comforted. ''Imagine our story now,'' he said. ''Our feeling is so bad. We are devastated, and we just pray.'' ASIA'S DEADLY WAVES: THE WEB OF GRIEF"
"Thousands of years ago, with a force that shook the earth, ice dams in the mountains here gave way, sending a towering, churning wall of water -- the equivalent of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie flowing at a rate of 10 times all the rivers on the planet -- on a frantic dash to the Pacific Ocean. The mammoth lake held back by the dam, Glacial Lake Missoula, was drained like a giant bathtub, in perhaps as little as 48 hours. And like an enormous high-pressure fire hose, the water moved massive amounts of rock and left scars in the bedrock of four states. This catastrophic event, in the last ice age, was not the only flood from the lake. There were dozens or more similar ''flood outbursts'' in the last ice age, and perhaps many more in previous ice ages. For years, geologists and devoted amateurs have lobbied for a regional trail to offer the public an interpretation of the geologic record of these floods, from western Montana, where Glacial Lake Missoula formed, to huge boulders encased in icebergs that were washed from the Rockies by the surge and deposited in Oregon near the Pacific Ocean. At last, their efforts may pay off. Last month, legislation was introduced in Congress by Representative Doc Hastings, Republican of Washington, to create an Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail along the path of the floods, on public and private land across Montana, Idaho, Washington and Oregon. The trail would be the first with a geologic theme, although long-distance interpretative trails have been devoted to cultural phenomena, like the travels of Lewis and Clark. ''It's a world-class geological phenomena,'' said Dale Middleton, president of the Ice Age Floods Institute, which pressed for the trail. ''These were some of the largest floods ever to occur on earth, they are relatively unknown and they left dramatic features on the landscape that are hard to understand if you don't know what happened.'' The story of the flood is not just one of catastrophic geology; it includes personal narratives as well, including that of J Harlen Bretz, the researcher who first identified the flood geology in the early 20th century. At first no one believed his theories, but in 1979, at the age of 96, he was honored with geology's highest award, the Penrose Medal. Just after the turn of the 20th century, Mr. Bretz, then a curious high school science teacher in Seattle, noticed water-created potholes and cliffs near Grand Coulee, Wash., that, it seemed to him, had obviously once been waterfalls. During further research, he wandered the sere prairie landscape of south-central Washington and came across other puzzling features. One area that particularly intrigued him were the ''channeled scablands,'' which begin south of Spokane. The surface of some 2,000 square miles of prairie from Spokane to the Cascades was peeled off, leaving small islands of prairie in an ocean of exposed dark basalt. It is the only place in the world with such a landscape. In his first paper, in 1923, Mr. Bretz theorized that ''huge, violent rivers of glacial melt water'' had caused mayhem with the geology. But at the time, the field was ruled by ''uniformitarianism,'' the idea that slow and gradual geologic process sculpted the earth. In this theory, there was no room for ''catastrophism.'' Mr. Bretz's article was ridiculed. But in 1940, a United States Geological Survey geologist, Joseph Thomas Pardee, delivered a paper proposing that the Missoula Valley of western Montana had once been part of a giant glacial lake, created by the southern lobe of the Cordilleran ice sheet that blocked what is now the Clark Fork River. Geologists realized that this was likely the source of Mr. Bretz's flood, and the field made room for the theory of catastrophes. One of Mr. Bretz's most vociferous critics, James Gilluly, later apologized and said of himself, ''How could anyone be so wrong?'' Mr. Bretz died in 1981 at age 98. Norman Smyers, a United States Forest Service geologist in Missoula, recently pointed to numerous horizontal lines across the face of broad, treeless mountains on the edge of town and explained that Mr. Pardee had realized these were the geological record of ancient shorelines. ''They are like bathtub rings,'' Mr. Smyers said. ''And when you stand in Missoula, you realize we're a long way down at what was the bottom of that lake. It was one of the deepest lakes on the planet.'' Based on studies of a smaller glacial lake in Iceland that drained in a similar way, Dr. Richard Waitt, a geologist with the Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash., believes that once Glacial Lake Missoula filled to about 90 percent, it could no longer fill to the east, so it started melting and pushing against the glacial dam, creating a tunnel. ''Suddenly the roof collapsed, and out goes the lake, all 520 cubic miles of it,'' Dr. Waitt said. ''It must have been spectacular.'' The number of times an ice dam formed and was blown out is still debated, but it was likely scores of times. ''It was a self-dumping lake,'' said Dr. Eugene Kiver, a professor emeritus of geology at Eastern Washington University in Cheney, Wash., who has studied the floods for three decades. ''The ice would block up the Clark Fork Valley, the ice dam became unstable and collapsed, and the glacier would advance and fill the lake again.'' Each outburst made its mark. When the flood waters were released, they picked up huge rocks, chunks of ice and other debris, and roared across the landscape at speeds estimated at 65 miles an hour or more. Like a giant rasp, the surge carved out new features, deposited valleys full of mud and created ripple marks from current that are obvious to this day. The bizarre channeled scablands of southeastern Washington for example, were formed as the muddy, rock-laden water washed down the Spokane River Valley and flowed over the edge of the valley onto the basalt of the Columbia Plateau. The surging water washed away the basalt and much of the rich topsoil. Just a mile from the scablands, where the water did not reach, the soil is rich. One of the most dramatic flood features is Dry Falls, in Grand Coulee, a cataract five times as wide as Niagara that Mr. Bretz had noticed. Below the falls are a series of depressions in the rock that were ancient plunge pools. Farther south is the remnant of another giant waterfall, Palouse Falls. A tiny stream of water still drops over the cliff edge, but it is just a trickle compared with what once roared through. When the water and the debris reached the western edge of Oregon, it dropped a load of topsoil that makes the Willamette Valley fertile for farming. As the flood pulse continued, geologists say, it hit the Pacific with 90 percent of its solid material intact and continued on 1,200 miles into the sea, smoothing the Tufts Abyssal Plain, a feature of the ocean floor. While much is known about the floods, experts say there are critical clues missing, first because each flood swept away or covered evidence of earlier ones, so that carbon 14 dating cannot be used. ''When you wash your crime scene clean that many times,'' said Mr. Smyers of the forest service, ''you lose a lot of evidence.'' It is also unclear whether other water sources, like Glacial Lake Columbia in Washington, contributed to the floods. Dr. Kiver said archaeologists suspect that some of the floods may have happened when people were around. ''Native Americans have myths about floods,'' he explained. But so far, no artifacts have been found in sediments. Prehistoric floods in Siberia rivaled the ones here, although little research on them has been published. In Patagonia and Alaska the creation and bursting of glacial dams still happens frequently, though not on the scale of the Lake Missoula floods. ''In terms of geologic events, it's no less important than what you would see at Mount St. Helens, the Grand Canyon or Death Valley,'' Mr. Smyers said . Correction: September 1, 2004, Wednesday Because of an editing error, an article in Science Times on Aug. 24 about the proposed Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail in the Northwest credited the project erroneously with a first. The nation in fact has other trails with geological themes. The headline also misstated the trail's accessibility. It would be accessible mainly to drivers; it would not be walkable."
"Alfred Morain could hardly summon the words to describe what he experiences when he looks at his land filled with dead nutmeg trees, which Hurricane Ivan felled as it swept over this island three weeks ago, blowing away Mr. Morain's livelihood with it. ''There is real devastation in my heart,'' he said Tuesday, surrounded by his wife and four children outside the 10-by-12-foot wooden shack he calls home. Like thousands of other Grenadians, Mr. Morain is struggling to rebuild amid the wreckage left behind by Ivan, one of the most powerful storms to hit the Caribbean and the United States in decades. Perhaps no island suffered more damage than Grenada, a relatively prosperous former British colony where tourism and the spice trade are the mainstays of the economy. At least 39 people were killed. Now it is an island where the houses have no roofs and the streets are lined with debris. The winds ripped the tops off of most buildings, destroyed churches and schools, knocked down most of the island's power lines and left corrugated steel roofing littered along the streets like used tissue paper. Looting broke out on the island, twice the size of Washington, D.C., after the storm hit on Sept. 7, damaging at least 90 percent of the buildings and leaving several thousand of the 100,000 residents homeless. To complicate security, the warden of the island's only prison let all the inmates out during the storm. About 200 troops from neighboring countries were shipped in to help the local police quell the looters and track down convicts who did not return voluntarily to prison. Only about a dozen convicts are still at large, said a police spokesman, Troy Garvey. But a dusk-to-dawn curfew remains in place, and troops with automatic weapons still guard banks in St. George's downtown. Government officials and aid workers said clean drinking water and food were still scarce on much of the island, despite deliveries of aid coordinated by the National Emergency Relief Organization. Most residents still lack electricity and telephone lines, they said. All over the island this week, people could be seen putting tarps up to replace lost roofs and hammering together small frame houses that had collapsed in the storm. The high winds and tornadoes spawned by Ivan destroyed the roof and stained-glass windows of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, as well as the prime minister's residence and the governor general's mansion. Several yachts capsized or ran aground in St. George's harbor, a popular destination for avid sailors. Schools are closed indefinitely. Prime Minister Keith C. Mitchell estimated the damage at more than $1 billion. The island's two main crops, cocoa and nutmeg, have been wiped out, and it will take at least a decade to regrow the nutmeg groves. Most of the major tourist hotels were badly damaged as well. Several large airlines, among them Virgin Atlantic, have suspended flights to the island indefinitely. It has been a devastating psychological blow for the residents of this country, where a United States-led invasion in 1983 toppled a military-installed Marxist government. Grenada has seen an average 7 percent growth in its economy for the last nine years and has not been through a major hurricane in more than four decades, Mr. Mitchell said. ''The devastation caused by Ivan was almost total, and as I have indicated to people, the devastation is even worse from a psychological standpoint,'' he said in an interview on Tuesday. ''People have never gone through anything like this, and I think most people had certain plans for their own lives, certain calculations about when they want to retire, when they want to do certain things, what additional things they want to do, the education of their children. And all of a sudden, they see everything that they have just thrown in pieces on the ground.'' Hotel owners and others in the tourist trade were some of the hardest hit. Andre Cherman, a 52-year-old hotelier, woke up after the storm to find Ivan had demolished more than half the rooms in the Coyaba Beach Resort, the three-star hotel that is his pride and joy. The roof is gone. Rubble fills his office and the courtyard. There is still no power or safe water. Mr. Cherman estimates that it will take $6.5 million and at least a year of work to restore his hotel. In the meantime, he has laid off all but a handful of his 95 employees. He is not alone. Most of the tourist hotels on the long, white beach south of St. George's are shuttered indefinitely. ''Everybody's in a state of shock on the island,'' Mr. Cherman said, sitting in his hotel's lobby, surrounded by wreckage. While Mr. Cherman had insurance, many of the 7,500 farmers who depend on nutmeg for a living did not. They have no hope of replanting the trees anytime soon, and it takes a decade for a nutmeg tree to become fruitful. The island normally produces about six million pounds of nutmeg a year. Mr. Morain, the nutmeg farmer, said he would start planting vegetables, bananas and other subsistence crops to feed his children. About three-quarters of his income used to come from the 16 acres of nutmeg trees he tended and harvested every year. It brought in about $3,500 a year, which was just enough to survive on, with some odd jobs to help make ends meet, he said. ''We will have to go back to the land and plant up,'' said the 43-year-old Mr. Morain, surveying piles of brown nutmeg trees behind his house. ''It's the land you understand. That's where the food must come from. Back to square one, man.'' Other nutmeg farmers in the Après Tout area said they were not sure they would be able to start over. One was Harris Phillip, a 73-year-old farmer who has lived off his nutmeg trees for 50 years. He said he was too old to begin anew, too crippled from arthritis. He has no savings. He has no idea how to survive the coming year. ''It's a bad disaster,'' he says, sitting on a hillside, looking over his ruined lands and the Caribbean's deep blue beyond. ''I don't know where to put me hand now. I don't know what to do.''"
"As the death toll here in this shattered and flooded town rose above 1,000, people scrambled in the streets on Thursday after food handouts from the United Nations, shoveled mud from their flooded homes, and tried to come to grips with the aftermath of the tropical storm that raked the coast last weekend. City officials said they had begun burying victims in common graves, but health workers said they feared cholera and other waterborne diseases would soon infect the survivors, who wandered through the streets, between washed-away buildings, through calf-deep, foul-smelling water, with their belongings on their heads. Water and food were precious commodities, and the muddy survivors of the storm struggled with each other over handouts at the city hall, screaming at city officials who kept them at bay with sticks and rods. ''There is no water, no electricity, no communication,'' Mayor Calixte Valentin said. ''Many people don't have a place to sleep.'' The storm, code-named Jeanne, slow-moving and with relatively low winds, thrashed the north of Haiti last Friday and Saturday, flooding the island's denuded hills with torrents of rain that washed away much of this town. Residents said the waters rose as high as 10 feet in the streets of the town, drowning hundreds of people. By midafternoon on Thursday, Haitian officials said the storm had killed more than 1,105 people in the country, the great majority of them in Gonaïves. Another 1,251 people were still missing, said Dieufort Deslorges, the spokesman for the Civil Protection Bureau. At least 4,000 houses were destroyed, he said, adding, ''The biggest problem right now is the need for clean water.'' In the town, carcasses of animals rotted in the receding waters and the smell of bodies and open sewers poisoned the air. Many buildings had been washed away. The rest were filled with heavy mud. Crops of corn outside town were swept away by the masses of water. ''There is no way to stay here anymore,'' said Medira Jarmis, a 45-year-old laborer who was fleeing Gonaïves with eight family members after the flood destroyed two of his houses. ''There are so many deaths that the place stinks, and there is nothing to eat and nothing to drink.'' The catastrophe here comes in a year marked by revolts, military intervention and deadly floods. Gonaïves was also a center of fighting during the revolt in February that led to the ouster of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in which 300 people were killed. Maita _lvarez, an aid worker with Oxfam, which is distributing clean water, said: ''The hygiene situation is appalling. There is no running water, no latrine. Some people have been drinking dirty water where dead bodies were floating. It's appalling.'' The efforts by the United Nations, Oxfam, CARE and other aid groups to get food and water to the town have been hampered by the poor condition of the main road from the capital, Port-au-Prince, a trip that takes at least five hours. Just outside Gonaïves, the road is submerged for about a mile under three feet of flood waters. Several trucks have slipped off the road into the water, including at least one World Food Program vehicle. People trooped through the water, some weeping, with their belongings on their heads, heading for other towns where relatives might take them in. In the streets of Gonaïves, people angrily complained that no food or water was getting through. Hunger sparked many fist fights, and city officials said aid trucks were mobbed by residents before they could distribute the food they had brought. ''If people don't get aid now, many of them will die of starvation,'' Bishop Yves-Marie Péan, the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Artibonite Department, who is sheltering more than 300 refugees in his residence and in the town's cathedral. ''We need water, clothes, pots, sleeping bags, toiletries, toothpaste, soap.'' Some victims were also trying to deal with the trauma of having watched loved ones die. Along the streets, tired people with vacant stares could be seen sitting on their stoops, surveying the flooded roads. Robenson Previus said he watched his cousin attempt to swim from a flooded house across a street that become a river, in a vain effort to reach a two-story building. His cousin, Charles Hubert, who was 27, disappeared under the waters, his arms thrashing. They buried him at a mass grave on Thursday in a neighborhood called Bois Marchant, Mr. Previus said. ''City Hall came and buried the body.''"
"LONG ISLAND politicians don't agree on much except for water. Democrats and Republicans alike have been steadfast in saying that the future of Long Island depends on a high-quality water supply. Why, then, are they allowing our wetlands to be dangerously exposed to destruction? On Long Island, marshes trap and filter the water that slowly percolates into the ground, replenishing aquifers that serve private and municipal water systems. Pollutants from fertilizers, manure, sewage systems and other sources are processed by plants and microorganisms in the soil. In this way, wetlands take in polluted water and release cleaner water. They also provide a place for amphibians, ducks and other animals to breed and forage. Wetlands also act as a crucial buffer to flooding in our flood-prone region. A survey on water conducted by the State of Illinois found that destroying just 1 percent of a watershed's wetlands increases total flood volume by almost 7 percent. Unfortunately, the protection of this important resource was put in jeopardy in 2001 by a United States Supreme Court decision that limited the federal government's authority to regulate certain wetlands. The impact of that decision was compounded in January 2003, with the federal government's release of guidelines that limited the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers to enforce Clean Water Act rules for wetlands, small streams and other waters that are considered isolated, or not connected to navigable waters in the United States. In the states neighboring New York, laws provide protection for wetlands no longer covered by federal law. Unfortunately, New York law regulates only wetlands that are 12.4 acres or larger and those designated as being of ''unusual local importance'' by the state's Department of Environmental Conservation. Therefore, many small but vital wetlands in New York now lack federal or state protection, opening the possibility that they could be filled in or drained. And while this is happening across the state, establishing protections for wetlands is especially urgent for Long Island, where the pace of development is faster and where small marshes are more abundant than in the rest of New York. Under the Department of Environmental Conservation's rules, Nassau County has only 55 wetlands that are regulated by the state. Suffolk is more fortunate because many of its small wetlands are considered to have unusual local importance, and so has 1,000 that get state protection. (The number of small wetlands in Nassau and Suffolk that are not protected is unavailable because New York's conservation department doesn't map them.) That's not good enough in a region that is so dependent on wetlands for water and flood protection. No matter their size or special designation, Long Island's wetlands should be protected as they were under the old federal law. The wetlands could then be regulated by the conservation department. Since the department is already enforcing the existing law, additional costs would be minimal. It's true that many of Long Island's wetlands have protection under local ordinances, but that doesn't mean that state protection is superfluous. New York's conservation department has specially trained inspectors, police officers and lawyers who are better able to spot illegal filling of wetlands and have more resources to enforce the law. According to the Department of Environmental Conservation, about 20 percent of New York's wetlands have been left unprotected as a result of the federal changes. New York is the only state in the Northeast that imposes a size threshold -- all other states identify wetlands based on scientific criteria, like the wildlife found in them and the effect on local rivers and water supplies. Urgent action is needed to close this legal loophole. The clean water protection and flood prevention act that is now being considered in the Legislature should be passed, and Gov. George Pakaki should sign it. The bill would better protect New York's smaller wetlands from unregulated filling and other destructive activity by reducing the size threshold from 12.4 acres to one acre. These changes would allow state authorities to protect many of the wetlands that used to fall under federal jurisdiction. Long Island needs state and federal protection for its wetlands. If Democratic and Republican legislators on Long Island truly believe that the region's future depends on a high-quality water supply then they must act now to protect our wetlands. Long Island Michael White is chairman of the Long Island chapter of the New York League of Conservation Voters."
"Battering wind and record-setting rain from Tropical Storm Gaston caused at least five deaths as a deluge washed away roads, flooded houses and businesses, and sent vehicles floating down the streets of Richmond. Five people were confirmed dead by late Tuesday, and several others were reported missing. On Monday afternoon, rushing waters replaced rush-hour traffic in downtown Richmond, where a flood wall, built in 1995 to contain the James River in such storms, stood with its gates left open, because powerful rains had outstripped the river's rise and raced downhill. At the bottom of historic Church Hill, cars floated past the Farmer's Market as swiftly and easily as the boats that plied the river 200 years ago. Swift-water rescue teams took stranded drivers and their passengers to safety as the waters rose on both sides of the James. On Tuesday, Gov. Mark Warner visited the Shockoe Bottom district, where floodwater reached 9 to 10 feet a few blocks downhill from the state's Capitol and the Executive Mansion. In some places, cars had come to rest atop one another; others clustered against buildings or light poles. Governor Warner told a group of Shockoe Bottom business owners that small-business low-interest loans would be available. ''For those who live and work here,'' he said, ''we're going to be with you to try to help you rebuild.'' As another major storm, Hurricane Frances, makes its way north, the state faces the possibility of more devastation later this week. Governor Warner said he was keeping an eye on the hurricane. ''I just checked, and it looks like it might be veering a little off course,'' he said. ''But in light of Isabel a year ago and Gaston this week, we're going to err on the side of extra preparedness.'' Around 8 p.m. on Monday, after five hours of high wind, heavy rain and multiple tornado warnings for the area, the governor declared a state of emergency for affected areas across Central Virginia. About 1,000 people were forced from homes in Richmond, where the storm's effects were felt hardest. The strip of I-95 that runs through the heart of Richmond was closed Monday night as driving rain, strong wind gusts and flash floods caused at least 20 accidents. By Tuesday morning, 18 primary and 161 secondary roads in Central Virginia were closed, flooded or completely washed out by Tropical Storm Gaston, which weakened to a tropical depression before it trundled through Richmond, bringing 14 inches of rain in eight hours in some areas. The storm came ashore on Sunday in South Carolina. Between 5 and 9 p.m. Monday, the storm circled the Richmond area, with pounding rain and whipping wind coming in surges that lasted from minutes to an hour or more. The National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings, sometimes with only minutes between the end of one warning and the beginning of the next. The service confirmed that two tornadoes touched down in Nottoway and James City Counties."
"Thousands of people were forced to flee their homes along the Delaware River on Sunday, after heavy rains Saturday from the remnants of Hurricane Ivan caused the river to swell to its highest level in decades. The river spilled over its banks along an 80-mile stretch from Easton, Pa., as far south as Trenton, forcing the authorities to close several bridges, shut down flooded roadways and evacuate homes. There were no deaths or serious injuries reported, but one house in Phillipsburg, N.J., was uprooted by the waters and carried downriver several hundreds yards before hitting a bridge. Although the waters were expected to crest by 10 p.m. Sunday, a flood warning was to remain in effect until at least Monday morning, said Sgt. Kevin Rehmann, a spokesman for the New Jersey state police. In Trenton, where the waters reached nearly 25 feet above flood level, about 1,000 people left their homes, stretches of Route 29 were submerged and state workers filled sandbags to protect office buildings near the river. About 75 people spent Saturday night or part of Sunday at an emergency shelter in the Joseph Stokes Memorial School, including about a dozen residents from the Water's Edge home for the elderly in South Trenton, which was evacuated Saturday afternoon. Mercer County's sheriff, Kevin Larkin, said that some residents may not be able to return to their homes until Tuesday. ''We're just telling them, we are going to protect your residences and if you can just put up with a little discomfort for a couple of days, we'll get you back to normal,'' the sheriff said. Across the river, in Bucks County, Pa., more than 1,600 people were evacuated, according to Ann Machesic, a county spokeswoman. Some of the most severe flooding occurred in Yardley, where sections of the town's tiny downtown were closed and some homes and businesses near the river were reportedly knee-deep in water. The flooding came a day after torrential rain pounded sections of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and upstate New York, leaving five inches of rain in some communities. On Saturday, Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey declared a state of emergency for Mercer, Hunterdon, Sussex and Warren Counties, and by early Sunday, emergency service officials were beginning to evacuate some neighborhoods near the river's edge. Joseph Quick, 76, said he was resting in his room at the River's Edge home on Saturday when teams of emergency workers and staff members led him and other residents out of the building. ''I'd like to go back,'' said Mr. Quick, as he pushed his walker in the emergency shelter. ''They pulled me out of my bed.'' A meteorologist from the National Weather Service, Joe Miketta, said the flooding was more severe than it was during the last major flood on the Delaware, in 1996. Saturday's rains were caused by the remains of Hurricane Ivan, which killed 70 people in the Caribbean and another 43 along the Gulf Coast of the United States. In some parts of New Jersey, the rain fell at one and a half inches per hour, Mr. Miketta said, and when the runoff reached the Delaware, the sheer volume of water caused the river to spill over its banks. By late Sunday morning, the rushing water had risen to within three feet of the deck of the bridge between Lambertville, N.J., and New Hope, Pa., raising concerns that the structure could be damaged or washed out. By early evening however, the water level began to drop, and local officials said they believed that the worst danger had passed. ''We're feeling pretty confident that we are going to be O.K.,'' said Lambertville's police director, Bruce Cocuzza. Despite the warnings issued late Saturday, some residents were still surprised by the flooding Sunday because the heaviest rains fell in communities far from the river. Sue Holzmer, of Titusville, N.J., said she was just beginning her honeymoon in Cape May when she got a call Sunday morning that helicopters were over her house and the river was flooding. She returned home to find two feet of water in the basement. ''It never ceases to amaze me, the power of this river,'' Ms. Holzmer said. In many communities along the river, the Delaware was watched more in awe than in fear. With Sunday's mild temperatures and brilliant sunshine, families walked to watch ducks and geese paddling down flooded streets or marvel at the rushing river, which carried fallen trees, barrels and overturned boats. At Washington Crossing State Park, hundreds of sightseers were snapping pictures of the rising river as it raced under the Washington Crossing Bridge. Just north of the state park, most of the homeowners in the Titusville area were keeping close watch of the rising tide and waiting it out. Only five homes were evacuated in that waterfront community. ''I don't think it's going to hit the deck,'' said one resident, Jim Trainor, sticking a tape measure into the river and noting about 10 inches of leeway between the river and his deck patio. ''If necessary, I could be out of here in 10 seconds.''"
"The wetlands of southern Florida were formed for, or at least well adapted to, the weather of the hurricane belt. Most of its natural vegetation grows low, except for the oak trees. Its native animals are built low to the ground; alligators hunker down and present their tails to the wind when it gets wild. But as the state's population was climbing to its current 16 million, inland water became something to be moved. Naturally wet land was dried out, largely by a system of canals, levees, pumps and gates. More than 2,000 miles of canals and more than 120 structures keep backyards dry and allow naturally wet counties like Broward to accommodate more than 600 houses per square mile. Now the arrival of two hurricanes in the past month and a third one, Hurricane Ivan, bearing down on Florida, the managers of the state's water control system are increasingly forced to choose between their dual objectives. They want to keep the ecosystem, including the estuaries on both coasts and the Everglades, in as natural a state as possible, and they want to save lives and keep property from flooding. In this heavy hurricane season, accomplishing both objectives is increasingly difficult. Hurricane Charley and Hurricane Frances have left most of south Florida's water system brimful, and the first priority of the South Florida Water Management District is to minimize flooding in residential areas. So its engineers are furiously pumping millions of gallons of water -- the equivalent of several swimming pools full -- a second through the Caloosahatchee River to the west and a half-dozen canals to the east. The agency has also opened a series of gates that hold water in the upper Everglades, the overfull wetland area dedicated for the use of the Miccosukee tribe of Indians, and allowed it to meander into Everglades National Park. This is something the Miccosukee think is long overdue and park officials reluctantly accept as an emergency effort to avoid urban flooding. ''Hurricanes and the Everglades go hand in hand,'' said David Reiner of the environmental group Friends of the Everglades. ''That's what helped form Florida. That's what sustains it.'' But, Mr. Reiner added, ''people living around it kicks it out of balance.'' The needs of the people, however, are a priority of the water system managers. Given that inherent conflict, biologists said in interviews that this season's hurricanes -- and the effort of agencies to compensate for them -- will help, or hurt, or both, depending on which part of the ecosystem is involved. ''We're trying to mimic natural systems,'' said Dan Kimball, the superintendent of Everglades National Park. ''And you know hurricanes are part of the natural system here.'' Mr. Kimball added, ''They can eliminate a lot, but can spread a lot of seeds at the same time.'' The decades of development that have brought people and their farms and shopping malls to the state provide various cargoes to be carried into the estuaries with the leftover rain. There is agricultural runoff, loaded with nutrients that transform the waters they linger in. There are the seeds of invasive species that take advantage of the storm's disturbance to insinuate themselves into new soil. And there is the urban runoff, with all the associated animal waste and fertilizer and assorted chemicals. ''When a hurricane goes through, an estuary can see raw sewage coming in, and that can change an ecosystem for years,'' said Fred H. Sklar, the chief environmental scientist with the South Florida Water Management District. Algae blooms, a sign of water overrich in nutrients, are likely to appear, and fish kills in oxygen-depleted waters are possible, Mr. Sklar said. In Everglades National Park, the new water coming in from the gates near the Miccosukee reservation may cover alligator nests and kill off a portion of the season's unhatched or newly hatched animals. (Miccosukee representatives say the same thing has happened to alligator nests on their side when the gates are closed.) But at the same time, the washing-machine effect of the storm on the waters of the Everglades and the estuaries off the Florida coast, scientists say, can have a cleansing effect, flushing decaying plants and other debris out of the system. Mr. Sklar said that human activities, like the introduction of invasive species, have more of an effect on natural systems than hurricanes -- but hurricanes can exacerbate the impact of the human activity. Some of the invasive species, like the Australian pine, Brazilian pepper trees, the fern called lygodium and melaleuca, a eucalyptus-like tree planted by the tens of thousands because its thirsty roots helped drain the soil, are likely to be vulnerable to hurricane winds. But their seeds compete aggressively with native species in the spaces cleared by the hurricanes. The refrain in Florida is that trees and plants grow back quickly here. But the two storms damaged trees that can take decades to mature in a state not known for patience. ''It's just not going to look the same,'' Charles H. Bronson, the commissioner of the Florida Agriculture and Consumer Services and a native of inland Kissimmee, said Wednesday in a telephone interview. ''It looks like somebody went through with big pruning shears in these cities with the old oaks.'' Citrus trees in central Florida lost fruit and may be permanently damaged by standing water. Cypress hammocks in the south were uprooted. Stands of pine suffered. Sabal palms, the state tree, fell. Nurseries, a growing industry in the state, experienced major losses. It may be the oaks -- live, laurel and water oaks -- best reflect the tension between how parts of the state once looked and the way new development continues to alter its appearance with grand royal and date palms. ''They were here with the Indians,'' James S. Haeger, 90, a botanist in Vero Beach, said of the oaks on the town's canopied streets. So were the tree islands of the Everglades, and for the Miccosukee Indians they became part of the culture after they arrived here more than 200 years ago. But from 1940 to 1995, with the growth of development and the need to store water in holding areas like the Water Conservation Area 3A -- Miccosukee territory -- the number of tree islands in that area declined by nearly half, to 581, and the total acres declined by 60 percent, to 8,621, federal data show. Even without hurricanes, water management in south Florida creates winners and losers, or at least a sense of grievance among some of those affected. Water management for the benefit of Miami-Dade and Broward County, and for the sugar cane farms at the northern end of the Everglades has prompted the Miccosukee to file repeated lawsuits to protect their own interests. When hurricanes come, the sense of grievance rises with the water. The tribe and its experts, like the lawyer Dexter Lehitinen and the hydrological engineer Terry L. Rice, who have led legal battles to lower the water level and reduce pollution in tribal areas, say that the hurricane flows simply exacerbate problems caused by the South Florida Water Management District. Scott Thorpe, the director of the Homestead Field Station of the water management district, is not engaged in that debate right now. Mr. Thorpe is trying to alleviate the pressure of excess water throughout the system, even at the risk of pumping oxygen-depleting nutrients into the estuaries and the Everglades and degrading, for a period of time, the natural systems. His job is to minimize destructive urban flooding. ''All we can do,'' he said, ''is get rid of as much water as we can.'' HURRICANE IVAN: THE EVERGLADES"
"Floodwaters receded Friday in this city where flooding from a tropical storm took more than 1,000 lives, leaving behind thousands of tired and hungry people who labored to clear the mud and debris from what was left of their homes. United Nations officials managed to distribute more than 40 tons of corn, flour and water in two of the hardest-hit neighborhoods of the city, Raboteau and Bienac, avoiding the mob scenes that have hampered aid efforts in recent days. But the United Nations soldiers at Raboteau used tear gas and fire shots in the air to control the crowd in the afternoon, witnesses said. But chaos and looting reigned elsewhere, as officials said the lack of help from the Haitian government and city police had hamstrung their efforts to feed more people. ''We are having trouble organizing the distribution because there is no authority existing in the town,'' said Eric Mouillefarine, who heads the Haiti branch of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. ''The government is absolutely not responding.'' Mr. Mouillefarine said the United Nations could distribute food in only two places because it needed to use soldiers and police officers from a peacekeeping force in Port-au-Prince to keep mobs of men from looting the food before it could be given to women who have been identified as needy. The police fled the city on Thursday, he said, without any warning. Without United Nations soldiers to guard them, some trucks carrying private donations from churches in other parts of the country were attacked and looted by bands of young men. The men raced after the trucks, climbed on the backs and broke the chains holding them closed. At 2:10 p.m., a crowd of looters managed to steal dozens of mattresses being trucked in from a church in the capital. The men ran down the street, ripped open the truck's rear doors and threw the mattresses out to the crowd. Earlier in the day, at about 10:15 a.m., people mobbed a truck in front of a school the United Nations is using as a headquarters here, scrambling after bananas, water and juice and frightened church workers trying to avoid being crushed by the crowd. ''This is not the place to do this,'' screamed Areito Ferreira, a Portuguese police officer who commands a United Nations police team here. ''There is no coordination around here.'' Some residents complained that even the distributions of bread and water that CARE International has made in recent days were being hijacked and resold. Other residents said they had already given up on official aid efforts. Leslie Desronvil, 52, said he had made a six-hour trip to Port-au-Prince to bring back spaghetti, rice, beans and other staples to his beleaguered family. The first floor of his house on Avenue Datts, a major thoroughfare, had been destroyed by floodwaters, and he and his wife, Fedline _mile, were living on the flat roof. They had hauled their furniture up and were cooking over an open fire. Mr. Desronvil said he had seen young men take the food provided by CARE International and the World Food Program and resell it. ''They need to give the food out house by house,'' he said. Hundreds of people tried to fish their belongings from the wreckage of their homes and wash them in the muddy, sewage-filled water on the streets. Scenes of wreckage were everywhere: tractor-trailers and cars overturned and thrown about like toys by the rushing waters of the storm, which has now developed into Hurricane Jeanne and is predicted to hit the Bahamas and Florida over the next few days. The streets were full of people carrying buckets of water from the few places where drinkable water was available. Others skimmed oil off stagnant pools left by the storm. Many walked the wrecked streets while dabbing their noses with lime to cut the stench. Still, there were signs of normal life returning to the town. Women began selling fruit, edible roots and other foods at open-air markets in neighborhoods on higher ground. Government backhoes cleared clogged storm drains. Near the port, mechanics were hard at work fixing bicycles and mopeds -- the most common mode of transportation here -- cleaning the mud out of their engines. The buses and trucks that ferry people to other towns began to run more frequently, and residents could be seen bringing back bags of food to their families. Mercilia Saintilien, an elderly lady, was among several neighbors sitting amid the wreckage of seven houses dismantled by the storm waters, trying to dry some clothes she had just washed in a bucket, draping them over the rocks that had been part of the destroyed houses. She had nearly died in the storm with her two grandchildren, she said. She and the children were trapped inside her house, unable to open the door and watching the water level rise inexorably toward her chest. She was saved when two neighbors, braving the wind and rain, climbed on her roof and cut a hole in the corrugated galvanized metal sheeting. They hoisted her and the children out just in time. She showed a reporter the jagged cut in her arm she received during the rescue. Health workers said they still worried about the possibility of epidemics of cholera, typhoid and other water-borne illnesses. The flood destroyed Providence Hospital, the city's main health care center, killing six patients and wiping out its operating room, laboratory and pharmacy. So the city is depending on a makeshift clinic put together by Chilean soldiers at the United Nations headquarters as well as three other clinics staffed by foreign doctors, including a contingent from Cuba. So far, most of the injuries have been minor wounds that quickly became infected in the inescapable pools of dirty water and mud, doctors and nurses said. ''The whole problem is sanitary,'' said Dr. Rudolfo Betancourt, a captain in the Chilean Army who was running the United Nations clinic. He said the lack of fully equipped hospitals had made things difficult for health workers. A 10-year-old boy died from a bad infection this morning, for a lack of the right antibiotics, he said. The medics were confronted with a man with a fractured leg that they could not set properly. ''There was no place to take him,'' he explained. While United Nations officials complained about the shortage of Haitian police officers to help with food distribution, Haitian officials charged that the United Nations was making a grave error in distributing food at only two sites on Friday. They said more and more food was being shipped into town from Port-au-Prince only to be stored at a warehouse run by CARE International rather than being quickly distributed. Heber Pélissier, president of the local chamber of commerce, said the United Nations needed to bring more soldiers to the ravaged city to begin handing out food in more places. ''They don't have enough military to secure the distribution points,'' he said. ''More food is coming in and not enough is going out. Every day there is a convoy that comes and it doesn't go out.'' But United Nations officials and aid workers said they were still trying to assess where the most needy and hunger-stricken residents were. It is true that CARE has more than 1,600 tons of wheat, lentils and oil stockpiled in its warehouse, but without secure distribution points and some way of gauging who is in need, it would be foolhardy to begin handing those supplies out, they said. Gary Philoctète, the mission development manager for CARE in Haiti, said his agency had first responded to the crisis by delivering bread and clean water to almost any area it could reach. But now it is trying to make the food deliveries to the hardest-hit parts of the city, while watching the level of food available in local markets. He said it made no sense to begin handing out food without enough police officers or soldiers to keep the crowds orderly. ''You can't settle a distribution center in five minutes,'' he said. ''Security is key. People are in need, but you have to set up a system.''"
